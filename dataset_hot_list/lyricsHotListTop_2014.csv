0,Blank Space,"[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

1,Take Me To Church,"Pre-Verse:
From here on earth
Please hear my verse
Cause yea they said it
But I said it first
So in a sense, I gave these ni**as birth
That's why my fans at my show screaming Take Me To Church!

Verse:
No suit and tie, but baby I go to work
Don't do it for the money but that's one of the perks
If y'all got the shovel then I've got the dirt
Burying rappers is what I mean when I say take 'em to church!
Oh man I'm back with more bars
Your girlfriend on my score card
Opportunity knocks...
Well someone please tell me where the doors are
Before I trample it ni**a
Somebody better answer this ni**a
If you ain't never heard of me...
I'm bout to show you what the mother f*ckin anthem is ni**a
Diamonds and Treasure, that don't bring me no pleasure
Every day I just wake up, saying I can do better
Tryna find me a girl to put her hands in the holes of my sweater
And truth be told I just pray that this moment last me forever
I swear I...

Don't do it for the money but that's one of the perks
If y'all got the shovel then I've got the dirt
Burying rappers is what I mean when I say take 'em to church!
And I'm more influential, cause I'm somewhat anti governmental
And I feel like all I need is God, I don't really give a f*ck if I offend you
I don't really think you know what I have been through
But that's something I'd rather not get into
Cause I can't put my life inside a pencil, and that's something I'd rather not pretend to....
Be able to do, and an 8th full of shrooms
Couldn't paint what I paint when the bass goes boom
And the lights go low, and they call it magic
Like I'm rockin a cape and a broom
Mental patient escaping the room
Now I'm out the basement headed straight for the moon
And it might be some black shit, but I feel like I'm Radio Active

4,I'm Not The Only One,"[Verse 1]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
You've been so unavailable
Now, sadly, I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Bridge]
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realise my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

[Chorus]
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

5,Thinking Out Loud,"[Verse 1]
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

[Chorus]
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Chorus]
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

I'm all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places

Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

I'm jealous of the wind
That ripples through your clothes
It's closer than your shadow
Oh, I'm jealous of the wind

[Chorus]
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me

[Verse 2]
I'm jealous of the nights
That I don't spend with you
I'm wondering who you lay next to
Oh, I'm jealous of the nights
I'm jealous of the love
Love that wasn't here
Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love, cause

Watch you slip through my hands

Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though!
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh! That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

Always workin' OT
Overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home
It kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep
Shit I'm talkin' might be too true

I don't take them shits but you do

Makin' juggs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state
Makin' money like my way

You know my gas stink

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!

Sometimes I need to be alone

I would share it, but today I'm yelling

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Refrain]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'

Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Whose fault?

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Bridge: John Legend]
I'll call you bitch for short
As a last resort and my first resort
You call me motherfucker for long
At the end of it, you know we both were wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
But I love to play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
On a bathroom wall I wrote
""I'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else""
I took a piss and dismiss it like ""fuck it""
And I went and found somebody else
Fuck arguing and harvesting the feelings
Yo, I'd rather be by my fucking self
Till about two a.m. and I call back
And I hang up and I start to blame myself
Somebody help

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
Let's call out names, names for sure

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You weren't perfect but you made life worth it
Stick around, some real feelings might surface
Been a long time since I spoke to you in a bathroom
Gripping you up, fucking and choking you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't getting this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be having mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear bout other niggas is strokin' you
Lying, say I hit you, he sitting there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 AM and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm calling your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew, he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money
That ain't right, girl
You getting blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied being in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained
Let's play the blame game

[Chorus: John Legend]
Let's play the blame game, I love you more
Let's play the blame game for sure

[Interlude: Kanye West]
""Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely""

I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, no, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much, I can't love you this much

[Outro: Kanye West]
And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back

I heard the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing

[Verse 2: Iggy Azalea]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody that will do ya how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gasping for air and you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (On it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shhh

[Verse 1: Usher]
The ballers in here tonight, they gon’ buy a hundred bottles
As soon as you shake it I know they gon’ make it colossal in here
'Cause shawty you thinkin’ them tricks that you do with your body
Got all of these niggas they crowding around you like they seen Beyonce in here (she here, she here!)
You want your own and you need your own, baby, who am I to judge?
'Cause how could I ever trip about it when I met you in the club?
I make enough for the both of us, but you dance anyway
You know I was raised in the A

When you get off of work I’ll be ready to go in the ‘Rari
And when we get home we’ll have us our own private party in here
So I don’t worry at all about the things they do or say

You can twerk while in a split, you racking up them tips
Your body rock and your booty poppin’, I’m proud to call you my bitch
They be lookin’, but they can’t touch you, shawty, I’m the only one to get it
So just go ahead and keep doing what you doing

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
(It's ya boy, Juicy J)
I’m just tryna cut her up, tryna bust a nut
Tryna take somebody bitch, turn her to a slut
Tryna fill my cup, tryna live it up
Throw some hundreds on that ass, walk her out the club
(Yeah, ho) Lap dance for the first date
Bet I threw a few bands, that’s third base
It’s okay if you work late
We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]

If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho

37,Something In The Water,"[Chorus]
There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

[Verse 1]
I'm holding on to the past, my mother says I'm growing up fast
Oh time is gone with a blink
It's time to think and put your worries aside
Today is just today and tomorrow never dies
So never live on a regret
Take every moment you get and actions speak louder than words
So shout to the sky if your words can not be heard

[Chorus]
Something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear
Cause I've fallen in love again, yes I've fallen in love again
With you, with you, with you

[Verse 2]
I'm wondering why my thoughts aren't clear
Am I hiding behind a crystal tear
Will the time stop before the dime drops
Will my foot print make the mark
Well I can see the light now as I'm stepping out the dark

[Chorus]
There's something in the water, calling my name
Too deep to hear, no idea
The message you sent, well it ain't clear

The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running
Daddy’s old Winnebago

Wing and a prayer down 65
Five best friends on four bald tires
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it

To Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

Like a storm, time rolls on
You can’t hit pause, that's just the deal
Most days in life don’t stand out
But life’s about those days that we all like

Rocking Randall
Getting rowdy
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon
‘til the Alabama sun was breaking

Over Talladega
Boys raised up
Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing
And thinking as that checked flag was waving
Sure would like to stay in
Talladega

When the winds go cold
And it blows October
I think about us shoulder to shoulder
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over
In my mind

Tonight I’m in Talladega

Whiskey in your glass
Here’s to turning up
Slowing down
And cars that go real fast

Or blush, or mad at me

55,Make It Rain,"[Verse 1]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord

Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

The emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain

Till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

It's shame and reproach gladly bear
Then he'll call me some day to my home far away
Where his glory forever I'll share

Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, ""Why you got so many condoms with you?""
I say, ""I'm a player, to be honest with you""
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal
Sremm killed the haters, God bless them

(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone
(Hey) They know better, (Hey) they know better
(Hey) No flex zone, (Hey) no flex zone

Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wasn't nothin' like that

[Verse 1]
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time, she was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen them thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up
I wrote back like, ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick!""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin' and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""

And I ain't never did this before, no

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' 'round in it, flawless

Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen

Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em

Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I’m quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I’m done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends

I'm speeding up and this is the

I never watch the stars, there’s so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I’m done with it (ooh)

They used to shout my name, now they whisper it

So now I grace this lovely shit
With something taken from the reaches of my dreams
Blood and guts
Fucker what's and accusations
Pucker ups, sleeper nuts
And adult situations

And dropping steady foot by foot
Story after story
Passing time, no time to take a look
Dory prolly sorry
Nemo lost but really ain't too shook
Stef is prolly left behind
But chilling with a solid book

Like, like they ain't coming back
And I refuse to feel a feeling
Like they ain't looking out
But I got eyes on every villain
Know the best way out
Like every room’s a burning building
Show the worthless to the dumpster
Keep the true and willing

Filling up on junk (junk)
Passing up on sustenance
Busting under stress they pushing buttons
How they rest? I bet they don't
Like even if they earned it (if they earned it)
Turn too many other cheeks

Everybody want to stray
Until you realize she bae

“Throw some D's up on that bitch!”
Empty floor! Let em talk!

And we run that fucking thing! (hahaha)

And one day I will sing those songs
Sing them ‘till they sleep

89,Like A Cowboy,"[Verse 1]
When I was six, I had two forty-fives
Strapped to my hips, wanted dead or alive
And all of the kids thought that I was a good guy at heart
When I got to high school, not much really changed
I ran from the cops in my souped-up Mustang
And all of the girls thought that I was a good guy at heart

[Chorus]
And I'd ride like a thief on the run
And I'd hide from the things that I've done
And I'd fly like the wind to the sunset
Just like a cowboy should do
Just like a cowboy should do

[Verse 2]
Girl, I will love you the best that I can
But you need to know that I am what I am
I'm not a bad guy but I'm not a good guy at heart

[Chorus]
And I'll ride like a thief on the run
Say goodbye to the things that I've done
And I'll fly like the wind to the sunset
Just like a cowboy should do
Just like a cowboy should do

[Bridge]
Wish I could tell you that I'll always stay
But I can't help that God made me this way
I know that there'll come a day

[Chorus]
When I ride like a thief on the run
Say goodbye to the things that I've done
And I'll fly like the wind to the sunset

Just like a cowboy should do
Just like a cowboy should do",Randy Montana,2014,"[91, 98]",2

91,Come Join The Murder,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a black bird perched outside my window
I hear him calling
I hear him sing
He burns me with his eyes of gold to embers
He sees all my sins
He reads my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
One day that bird, he spoke to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king

[Verse 2]
On a blanket made of woven shadows
Flew up to heaven
On a raven's glide
These angels have turned my wings to wax now
I fell like Judas grace denied

[Pre-Chorus]
On that day that he lied to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king

[Verse 3]
I walk among the children of my fathers
The broken wings, betrayal's cost
They call to me but never touch my heart, no
I am too far
I'm too lost

[Pre-Chorus]
All I can hear is what he spoke to me
Like Martin Luther
Like Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king

[Guitar Interlude]

[Verse 4]
So now I curse that raven's fire
You made me hate, you made me burn
He laughed aloud as he flew from Eden
You always knew, you never learn

[Pre-Chorus]
The crow no longer sings to me
Like Martin Luther
Or Pericles

[Chorus]
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king
Come join the murder
Come fly with black
We'll give you freedom
From the human trap
Come join the murder
Soar on my wings
You'll touch the hand of God
And He'll make you king
And He'll make you king",The White Buffalo,2014,[93],1
92,Sledgehammer,"[Verse 1]
I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

[Verse 2]
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole

[Chorus]
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer",Rihanna,2014,"[94, 99, 93]",3

[Verse 1]
First things first: rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real, you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Verse 2]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch, not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good.""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it.""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

[Chorus]
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do'
Nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt 'fore she leave
I'ma need my shirt back (nigga, you know how it go)

[Pre-Chorus]
One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

[Interlude: George W. Bush]
There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once… shame on… shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 4]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret, could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile

You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do

96,When I Was Your Man,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

(They say diamonds are forever)
(They say diamonds are forever)

[Verse 1:]
Public thought me a pessimist think my thoughts too pessimistic
Reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am and two-seated
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to God, somebody pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins, just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate but feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys, who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop you jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't meet ya momma but I told her I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too personal, lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens them idiots must don't love life

[Hook]
Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint
While under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off, loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright
Cookin' soft and selling hard while under neon lights

[Verse 2]
Bread Winner Mafia ? we poppin' in climates with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink then it's what I believe
Exploring desires this moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She, grippin' the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now while inside of it hollerin louder she get it with speed
This is we. They say diamonds are forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal girl)
Cling on got the theme song on my ringtone I'mma beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan that I'll have you scared better tell em I'll catch em I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July bout that
And they say diamonds are forever (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal)
From start to finish Go-Karts Assembled sayin life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, go now start ya engine
On a 90-day run we thought was different
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings but a understanding

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit

They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy

Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

And it ain't ever looked like that, girl
Look at you singing that song
I used to turn it off when it came on
Now it's my favorite, when you start singing it
Can't help singing along

Look at you drinkin' that drink
Little bit spicy, little bit sweet

Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go

Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Iv'e been lying to the ones i love
I've been lying to the lord up above
Sorry god I don't deserve to go to heaven
I've been around to many drugs
I told way to many lies
I've been with too many sluts
I fucked up too many times
Like way way more then once
I ain't never learn my lesson
I just keep on fucking up
God please send me a message
My heart is running out of love
I've been drinking heavily
Like way way more then i used to
Sorry god i'm ignoring what your'e telling me
I really hope that i don't lose you

Forget race or religion
I just want to be forgiven
For knowingly and unknowingly all the sins i've committed
I've got a lot on my conscious, i let it out
I've considered all the options, but when in doubt
I just turn to all my guilty pleasures instead of you
Desperate times call for desperate measures, that's my excuse
I'm wasting valuable seconds and neglected what's important
I've been blinded by the fame and the money
I got lost in a world full of cloths and the drugs, cars in the bucks, hoes in the club, what the fuck
It was everything i thought i wanted, still kinda is
Prayed for all the wrong things and got them, I wish i didn't
I wish i spent more time with my grandpa before he passed
Instead i was rolling up blunts and chasing ass
Spending all my cash while the medical bills pile up
All the while my momma ain't even smile once

I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it

Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit

Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight

I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell

With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack

I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)

Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2014,"[96, 80, 62, 59, 48, 50, 53, 51, 54, 48, 39]",11

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

In a torn up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like
Gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care; we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care; we aren't caught up in your love affair

We count our dollars on the train to the party

And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if they got money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind

111,Guts Over Fear,"[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shit stain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
""Do I really belong in this game?"", I pondered
I just wanna play my part
Should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the art form I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion 80 times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story, bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Chorus: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song
Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
Started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You,” ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt—and eat their fucking faces off!
The legend of the angry blond
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a—

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear, might shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
I let you keep me down

Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me and did I lose control? (Slow it down)

[Verse: Logic]
Yeah, take it all, ain't no way I could break it off
Girl is you really down to pay the cost? Reverse the role and you could play the boss
Already knowin' my... already knowin' my vision is faded
I try to evade it but can't, I know you far from a saint, but I keep lying to me
Cause I been dying to meet and it feel like I follow you out in the street
And I promise you all that I know, every way that my mind goes
Elevated, heart strong but my head faded
Way back when we first dated, I'm gone now, had to go cause I'm on now
When my intuition got me in a mission, we see eye to eye but you ain't in my vision
Oh no, I said oh no
Back in the day I used to say a girl like you
I used to pray for days for
Now I'm out here like way more, what the fuck would I stay for?
Why the fuck would I pay for somethin' that’s just gonna kill me? Nikki I'm still me

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
But I'm just better, it's been six months since we touched last
But I grow fast with this letter and I swear to God that I'm better

Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch yeah I need your fever

[Verso 1: Enrique Iglesias, Randy Marcos]
Yo te miro y se me corta la respiración
Cuando tú me miras se me sube el corazón

Y en un silencio tu mirada dice mil palabras
La noche en la que te suplico que no salga el sol

Me va enloqueciendo
Me va saturando

Con tu física y tu química
También tu anatomía
La cerveza y el tequila
Y tu boca con la mía
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo más)

Con esta melodía
Tu color, tu fantasía
Con tu filosofía
Mi cabeza está vacía
Y ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo mas)
Ya no puedo más (Ya no puedo mas)

Danny A
Naked Truth
""My big mouth""
Uh
Danny A Music
Yo
Let's go

[Hook]
You want to know my life? sit down I'll write you a CD
Don't ever think for a second my life is rated PG
Want to know the tale Liver Transplant to OD
Truthfully, that's by age 23 you think you know me?
If y'all think you deserve the whole Naked Truth
You could show me (you could blow me)
I promise you my life ain't as sweet as my mothers cooking
Best believe there ain't no blankets
For them nights in Central Bookings
It could get gory
Just 1% of the story
Naked Truth

[Verse 1]
Got a bunch of friends
Who can't relate to what I been through
Music is my therapy
Get it out through this pencil
Leave it all on the mic
The shit you put up with isn't nice
They don't know what it's like
To be in hospitals most your life
How many times you had a priest
Come and read you your last rights?
Twice
Doctors telling your mother
They're thinking you won't make it
OD was all over social media
Felt naked
Your friends just sending texts
But they won't visit and you take it
You show them love when you get out
But you know that you faked it
You couldn't last a minute
In my scuffed Air Forces
Your problems your Benz car note
And if bitches think y'all bosses
At the end of the day
It's all good 'cause daddy pays it
Man you know he will
'Cause out his daughters you're his favorite
Pull your skirt up
You're getting murdered through a vocal booth
Before you try to run your mouth bitch
Probably best you know the truth
The whole fucking buck naked truth

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Right to remain silent
Was the least of my problems
Felony dropped from court cases
Grandpa paid a lawyer to solve them
Have you ever been told
That you wouldn't make it 20?
And everybody in your neighborhood's obsessed with money
Back at school people like
""I thought you died"" and think it's funny
I dropped out 'cause I was sick
And missed too much
I ain't no dummy
Teachers looking at you
Like ""what a brain, such a waste""
And all you want to do is (cough phlegm)
And spit in their face
The crazy part of this
Is you still get the highest grades
Until you stop giving a fuck
And start to blaze
Stop showing up
Mom got BCW on her case
And they find her to be neglectful
Judging her on how you were raised
Now they call it ACS
But you ain't been to school in days
And you know hot damn well
She dropped you off
You walked away
What'd you do?
Bring the wrong jacket to school
That was your stash spot
Locked up with 11 knives
You know you also stashed pot
They keeping you in handcuffs
You don't know if you'll get out
You're just praying thanking Christ
They ain't check your nuts for your half ounce
You were raised by just your mama
She's clocking up out the precinct
Called and notified
Her son can't even act descent
Fist fights to more arrests
Got her car locked in impound
She had 2 trucks since you were born
She can't get in town
She always said ""don't call if you're locked up""
So you act dim now
She's like ""you didn't say I'm on the job?
Now you shut your big mouth?"" (my big mouth)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
At least I could still body the track
No matter what I know that
Plus the flow is murderous
Sound like a 90's throwback
I remember my grandfather gave my brother his car
I totaled it
All because I couldn't stay sober
Such a total dick
Cops come 'cause I hit a parked one
My mother jumps in
Start running my mouth again (my big mouth)
Cop chokes me out over nothing (I can't breathe)
Of course I was in the wrong man
What the hell was I thinking?
Oh yeah, Xannies and Percs
And purple Sprite's what I was drinking
Christmas 2013 start falling back into liver rejection
Mommy always said
""God gave you a gift you best protect it""
Abuse and disrespect it?
Shit that just wasn't in question
Until I got my life headed up in the wrong direction
You ever knock a chick up at the age of 14?
Back of your mind wondering about child support cream
Yo I told you, bullshit to the side
It could get gory
And this is just 1% of my side of the story
Naked Truth!

[Verse 4]
Growing up
Me and my big brother
Were playing men of the house
Just like my mother played her mother's mother
Dragging her around
You know what it's like
To have a man put his fist in front of your mother's face?
You're 6 years old
So you punch him in the nuts
And run away
Headed upstairs to grab your knife you got tucked away
Throw him out
Screaming how he ""better stay the fuck away!""
Think I'm worried about if my music will bring me riches (it will!)
Even if it doesn't, it's my love so what's the difference?
Like I said your biggest problems are your money and your bitches
You got less worries than my tummy got stitches
Naked fucking Truth

[Outro]
Danny A Music bitch!
2pac tell them what it is
""Staten Island Advance Danny A""
""My big mouth hahahahahaha my big mouth
I got a big mouth, can't help it
I talk from my heart, I'm real you know what I'm saying?
Whatever comes, comes and it's not my fault
I'm trying to find my way in the world you know?
I'm trying to be somebody
Instead of just make money off everybody
You know what I'm saying?
So I, I go down paths that haven't been traveled before
And I usually mess up, but
I learn, you know what I'm saying?
I come back stronger""

124,Sunshine & Whiskey,"Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

[Verse 1]
Chilling on a beach with my sweet Georgia peach
Not a care in the world, just trying to beat the heat
Body like an hourglass, sand on her feet
I can't help but stare cause I got the best seat
Just when I thought it couldn't get any hotter you slid on in
Said, ""I'm a little hot and bothered, if you know what I mean
Let's crank it up to a hundred degrees""

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
Like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red
Every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey

[Verse 2]
I was slow driving south with the top drop down
Her hair in the wind, Tom Petty up loud
You gave me that look, you licked them lips
I said, ""Hang on baby, better pull over for this""
I don't wanna get DWK, driving while kissing they'll put you away

[Refrain]
You hit me like fire, shot me like a bullet
Burned me up and down, no way to cool it
But every time you kiss me it's like sunshine and whiskey
It's like a bottle of Jack straight to the head
One shot, two shot, Coppertone red

125,Baby It's Cold Outside,"[Verse 1: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

Baby, it's cold

You could break me overnight
But there's no one like us
Insatiably insane
Equally exchanged

Dancing in the light of a canyon sun
Racing every wave
Going north on the one
The promises we made
I still haven't changed

Baby, come back, I know my way around your heart
Don't start thinking
Things have kinda changed
They're different from what they are
You know better
That nothing is better than what we built together at home
You can find me
Back in California and sleeping with all the lights on
Won't you come and turn them out?
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out
Come and turn them out

Making more than love on the west side of town
You could draw a line from the top to the ground
I'm selfless, drunk on you
What more could I do?

Throw it all away 'cause you do what you want
You took a little time, let 'em talk to you too much

Am I wrong for thinkin' out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for sayin' that I choose another way?
I ain't tryin' to do what everybody else doin'
Just 'cause everybody doin' what they all do

133,Amnesia,"[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he’s right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you
Do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All & Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still living in my phone
I admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you’re happy and it hurts that you moved on
It’s hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
It’s like we never happened, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them

And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape

If today I woke up with you right beside me
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
And you'd never slip away
And you'd never hear me say

[JEFFERSON]
Our partnership?

[BURR]
As your vice-President

[JEFFERSON]
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin’ bout, “I look forward to our partnership.”

[MADISON]
It’s crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be Vice President

[JEFFERSON]
Ooh!, you know what? We can change that. You know why?

[MADISON]
Why?

135,Where Do Broken Hearts Go,"[Verse 1: Niall & All]
Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standing out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So I built you a house from a broken home
And I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
It took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Verse 2: Liam & Harry & All]
Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is running in circles of you and me
Anyone in between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're running from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

[Chorus: Zayn & Harry & All]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Where do broken hearts go?

[Bridge: Harry & All]
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me where you go when you feel afraid
(Where do broken hearts go?)
Tell me now, tell me now
Tell me, will you ever love me again, love me again?

[Chorus: Zayn & All & Louis & (Harry)]
Now I'm searching every lonely place
Every corner calling out your name
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go?
Are you sleeping baby by yourself
Or are you giving it to someone else?
Tryna find you but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me where you're hiding out
Where do broken hearts go?
(Come on baby, 'cause I need you now)
Where do broken hearts go? Tell me 'cause I'm 10 feet down
Where do broken hearts go? Come on baby, come and get me out
Come on baby, come and get me out

What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time

Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself

You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I’m latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you
Now I've got you in my space
I won't let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I'm latching on to you

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
I'm so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamoured, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?
I feel we're close enough
I wanna lock in your love
I think we're close enough
Could I lock in your love, baby?

147,Welcome To New York,"[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want

148,I Won't Let You Down,"[Verse 1]
I wish that we could just talk
But I don't really know where to start
Yeah, you got every right to be mad
After all of the things that I said
I know I didn't deal with things properly
But now I'm tryna be the man I supposed to be
If I don't then I'll live the regret
'Cause I hate that I left you upset

[Pre-Chorus]
Threw your keys on the table
Said that I was ungrateful
And I thought I was strong, ohhh

[Chorus]
I know I hurt you
Never said 'I love you'
But I'll say it now
And you should know that
I'm not gonna hold back
This time around
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down
If you give me another chance
I won't let you down

[Verse 2]
I know I messed up but to tell you the truth
I was too busy hanging out with my crew
You were so cool with it ain't no excuse
I should spent a little time with you
Instead of just playing around, messing about that
I was in the driver seat but who's the passenger now
Sat here trying to figure out
Same song going round and round

[Pre-Chorus]
Threw your keys on the table
Said that I was ungrateful
And I thought I was strong, ohhh

I know I hurt you
Never said 'I love you'

If you give me another chance
I won't let you down

There are some things that we can not change
No, we can't go back in time
But I hope that it isn't too late
To give it another try, oh, I

149,Wildest Dreams,"[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your

150,Bad Blood,"[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes

If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

151,American Kids,"[Verse 1]
I live under a rock with a blacklight
I'm a dumb pop star in my own right
Started life at age 15, got ahead with fake IDs
If you're with me
Sold my soul to the man with a handshake
Lost control but I don't think it's too late
We're dying young on broadcast news
Forever 21 is cool if I make it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Girls, let's put on all of our clothes

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be like American kids
I am not on drugs and I've never been
I don't care about your party, I belong to nobody
I don't wanna be like American kids
Drugs don't work like they did for my parents
I'm not down with the new hit
'Cause today I just don't get American kids

[Verse 2]
Last time I told mom that ""I love you""
Was the last time I ate food from a drive-thru
It never happened like they say
I think my father may be gay but I don't know
So I burned all my shit in a bonfire
All my teen regrets were a trip wire
I should be everything you hate
I should be higher now than space but I'm static

Boys aren't even boys anymore (Huh)

I don't wanna be like American kids
I am not on drugs and I've never been

I could go for a tipsy tailgate kiss

Still got me hooked, been hooked for awhile
If you got a bottle you ain't opened yet
And an empty spot beside ya in ya bed
If you got some room for a little regret
Let me know girl I've already left...

If you're feelin' what I'm feelin' let's mix it up
You got my number baby hit me up
If you need a little late night pick me up

Or burnin' up the sheets with my tee on

Except work like a dog until Friday
Punch that clock, cash that check
Raise a little hell 'til Sunday (it's about that time)

Got a keg of beer and a bunch of girls
Sure enough going to be a good time

Oh, we about to throwdown, son
Now we got a field full of daisy dukes
Round here we know how to grow them
Rocking little body and long tan legs

Show a little something, girl

Riding around looking for some trouble
If they bring it across that county line
You know there's gonna be a rumble

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)

When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me

[Directed by Kiesza, Ljuba Castot and Rami Samir Afuni]

[Verse 1]
Taking me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout out, give me more
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh baby, it's out of my control
It's going home
But you're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day
That keeps me breathing

[Chorus]
Baby, I love the way that there's nothing sure
Baby, don't stop me
Hideaway with me some more
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, aah, ooh

[Verse 2]
You send me the shiver and the spine, might overflow
You're bringing me closer to the edge
I'm letting go
You're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Pulling my head into the clouds

You're bringing me higher than I've ever been before
I'm holding it back, just want to shout it, give me more
But you're just a hideaway
You're just a feeling
You let my heart escape
Beyond the meaning
Not even I can find a way to stop the storm
Oh baby, its out of my control what's going on
You're just a chance I take
To keep on dreaming
You're just another day, that keeps me breathing
You're a day that keeps me dreaming

Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet

Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette

Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high at the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya

'Til 3005, hol' up

[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up)

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

You're the last face I will recall
And best of all, I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you

I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say I love you to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry
I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains

And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though

All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga

We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated

It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga

Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach

Rolled down a window

The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right

The night is young

So let it out
And let me stay inside your drink

Off in the distance the lights of town
Can you see it now?

You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known
Maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door (hey)
Said we were done, then met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part, she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you should've known
I guess you should've known that I would talk, I would talk

And make you understand

I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

185,Anything Goes,"Times have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today
Any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
But now, God knows
Anything goes
Good authors, too, who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is
Intruding at nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her
Then I suppose
Anything goes
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
-ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
And that gent today
You gave a cent today
Once had several chateaus
When folks who still can ride in jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then 'Nana' shows
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now turns a handspring landing up-
On her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got
And those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got
From those news you've got
And those pains you've got
(If any brains you've got)
From those little radios
So Missus R., with all her trimmings
Can broadcast abed from Simmons
Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes",Cole Porter,2014,[76],1
186,Angel In Blue Jeans,"[Verse 1]
I saw an angel in blue jeans today
I felt that she melted all my bitterness away
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground

[Verse 2]
You look so tired you've got moonbeams in your eyes
And if I believed I know you'd be the first to fly
You always tried so hard to hide your wings behind your coat
So let it be and let them free
So you can't hoover low above the ground

[Bridge]
I'll find sunshine sometime soon

[Chorus]
How can I miss anything about you
When I don't even know what your name is
I feel like I know you as well as I know the sun
So please tell me where is my sunshine now

I'll find sunshine sometime soon

How can I miss anything about you

I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga's life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you

But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on 'em

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in

I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones

You better off not saying nothing

It was a perfect day for the end of May, they say a record high
I was starin' at that green water
When out of the blue and by surprise
She had her feet up on the cooler as she put our love on ice
She grabbed a beer, said, ""I'm out of here""
And walked out of my life

[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one

[Verse 2]
It ain't the first time, or last time I watched love walk out
But it's damn sure the one time I still ain't forgot about
I still like to drink a beer but a long neck I won't do
Cause every time I see one sweating, man
I break out in one too

[Chorus]
That was a cold one, I never will get back
If she had to leave
Did she have to leave me one beer short of a twelve pack?
She left me hanging high and dry in that
Hell hot summer sun
Damn babe, that was a cold one

That was a cold one, I never will get back

205,Sweet Little Somethin',"[Verse 1: Ricky Garcia]
When I met you, didn't know what to do
I'm the kind of person you look through
From two places worlds apart
You're into boats and works of art
But you're still tuggin' on my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Emery Kelly]
Give me one chance 'cause I can do that dance
Maybe show you I'm advanced in how to be your man
'Cause you know that everywhere I go
I kinda lose control of how you're making me feel

[Chorus: All]
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?
Baby, we'll get by, we'll get by
Sweet little something
Give me just one night, so let me ask you
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?

[Verse 2: Liam Attridge & Ricky Garcia]
Hey, on that first day
So lost for words to say
Little things came in to play
The way you smile to just one side
That sparkle in those pretty eyes
Makes me wanna blow my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Emery Kelly]
May take a while, but I can make that mile
Your hair, your grease, your style; the only reason I smile
One simple glance and that was all it took
You stopped my heart with just one look
You cast your line now I'm hooked

[Chorus: All]
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?
Baby, we'll get by, we'll get by
Sweet little something
Give me just one night, so let me ask you
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?

[Bridge: Emery Kelly]
Try my best, will never rest
Take on the world and nothing less
No matter what you put me through
I'm gonna make my way to you
You're made for me, just meant to be
Girl, someday you're gonna see

[Feature: Jordyn Jones]
You can keep on chasin' until my heart is racin'
Gonna keep you on your toes see how the love thing goes
Mean it boy, yo, don't be front
And maybe I'll be your sweet little somethin'

[Chorus: All]
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?
Baby, we'll get by, we'll get by
Sweet little something
Give me just one night, so let me ask you
Girl, would you be my, would you be my
Sweet little something?

And I won 10 bucks and that was just right

But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing

We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause

We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away

Lean back, tuck it in, take a chance
Swing it out, spin around, do the dance
I wanna play ball, not dance hall
I'm makin' a triple, not a curtain call
I can prove it to you 'til you know it's true
'Cause I can swing it, I can bring it to the diamond too
You're talkin' a lot;
Show me what you got
Stop!
Swing!
Hey
Come on, swing it like this
Oh, swing!
Ooh

216,We Are Tonight,"[Verse 1]
Summer coming through the rolled down window
Tearin' down an almost two lane backroad
Freedom and fireflies in the air
The night's still young
Never gonna get old
Living for the day
Like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves
The tires in the grass
Stayin' on the gas like we're never coming back

[Chorus]
It's a Friday night
It's a small town, girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
Two twelves in the truck back beating
Buncha rock stars on the river banks singing
Whoa, whoa
Everything
(Whoa, whoa)
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

[Verse 2]
Swingin' back and forth
Can't you feel the music?
Time stands still
And I don't wanna lose it
Her tan
Her touch
Her laugh
We're flying so high like we're never gonna crash

Dreaming as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

217,Best Mistake,"[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
How soon do we forget how we felt?
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on, yeah

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?

To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— [Gunshots]

Promise that you will sing about me

To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit...

[Chorus]
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?

[Chorus]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Outro]
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

[Verse 1]
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed – what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin' – backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works.""

[Skit/Outro]
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner.""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins.""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord.""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised Him from the dead.""
(I believe you raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life.""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior.""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life.""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward.""

[Verse 1 - K Camp]
Creeping on the low, hope your man don't see
She will bust it down for some damn Lime-A-Ritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can't hold back, better stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can't cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my shit hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass 'bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can you play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can't say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that

You know that ain't a real bag bitch, that's a knock off

All swimmin pool lakefront
Hit it from the back, rearrange her lace front
Stuntin', tattoos on my neck and on my kidney
If I don't like that ho I turn her ass into a frisbee
If I dont like your disc I turn that ho into a frisbee
I throw it out on Old Nat right by the Wendy’s
Three cellphones and all of 'em jumpin'
I can see your hoes and all em' nothing
Yeah I'm a don don', Don Cheadle, Don Cornelius
Watch the Dom spill
Pockets fat as Don Cartagena, nigga, done deal!

Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, ¡Andale!
Please don't play no games cause I know thats what you like

You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nunchucks doors and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my rolex they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Family, ain't nothing strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strong is at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes

They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
Thats part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Four hittas, four winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war with us
We be them, we be them, young ridahs
Raised in the gutters, really started from the bottom
We all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Give me the whole pie, real cheesy
I told your girl No but you might not believe me
Takin' pics for me, told her smile for me
Pass her off I'm a real team player
Bandanna on my face like a gangster

Got dreads in my head, used to pray for the lock up

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

[Chorus]
You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic (Baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 2: Tony Oller]
Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style
I'mma pick you up in a Cadillac like a gentleman bringing glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it how you—
Out of my league, old school chic
Like a movie star from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 3: Malcolm Kelly]
Baby you're class, and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you ever till we met
A star in the 40s, center fold in the 50s
You got me tripping out like the 60s, hippies

Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Hepburn, Beyonce, Marilyn, massive
Girl you're timeless, just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinking I was born in the wrong time

233,Ain't It Fun,"[Verse 1]
I don't mind
Letting you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feeding on

When the world don't orbit around you
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you

Everywhere I turn seeing iced out wrists
She might be German, she might be Swiss, (god damn)
And I'm feeling pretty hectic, lights all around
Good thing I'm not epileptic
I'm kinda confused like I'm measuring in metric
Talking shit, you better take it back interception
Like the forests are blazing
Get the wild life jumping like an animal rave

I, I can't deny
You're the reason that I cried every night
And I, don't know why
But you've never found your way out of my mind
Participating in your games
Is something that will never make me
Proud to be the one that you turned to

[Verse 2]
The push and pulls and in and outs
They always left me filled with doubt
But I can't say that I didn't love you
'Cause that'd be a lie, and I don't like being misled
So I won't put it in your head that I'm the same
The tears that I cried, all the miscommunication
And the testing of my patience drove me insane

[Chorus 1]
And now I wish I would've second guessed
The butterflies I'd get inside my chest
Convinced myself that we were meant to be
Oh why'd I let you walk all over me
Why'd I let you walk all over me

[Verse 3]
When you got a clue
Of all the pain and sadness that you put me through
Point for me, 'cause evidently
You did just what I expected you to do
I let myself be vulnerable, I hold myself responsible
For letting you stick pins into my heart
In retrospect the younger me was too lovesick and dumb to see
That it was a disaster from the start

[Chorus 2]
And now I wish I saved myself the pain
And looked from the perspective of my brain
I told myself that we could work it out
But it's too late to fix that problem now
Yeah it's too late to think about that now

243,Not A Bad Thing,"(Dave Berg/Sunny Russ/Deana Bryant)

I'm sittin' in this cafe
People talkin' so loud I can't hear myself think
That's not a bad thing
The coffee keeps on coming
The waiter who keeps smilin'
As I'm ridin' on a river of caffeine
An' that's not a bad thing

I used to feel sorry for someone like me
In a corner booth pretendin' to read on a Friday night
I used to say: ""It just ain't right.""
How could anybody ever have any fun
Without somebody, without someone?
It never dawned on me
The possibility
That it's not a bad thing

Those naggin' thoughts about you
How I left without you tonight:
You know, they're few and far between
The waiter's name is Joey, he told me
And that's when I noticed he ain't wearing any ring
An' that's not a bad thing

And there is a tug on the edge of my heart
It's you again sayin': ""Don't you start lettin' go of me.""
But I ain't listenin'
For once in my life, I'll feel what I feel
Let it be, let it be real
Let it flow through me
An' wash me clean
That's not a bad thing

As I'm drivin' home, I'm thinkin'
The worst might be over
Or maybe I'm a little bit naive
But the street lights seem brighter
As I walk to my front door
And I'm all alone when I turn the key
An' that's not a bad thing

I used to feel sorry for someone like me
In a corner booth pretendin' to read on a Friday night
I used to say: ""It just ain't right.""
How could anybody ever have any fun
Without somebody, without someone?
It never dawned on me

244,Play It Again,"[Verse 1]
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

[Chorus 2]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Bridge]
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

[Chorus 3]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss

You with the nomenclature (Woo!) (Meow!)
You'll learn the definitions (Hey, hey, hey)
Of nouns and prepositions (Hey, hey, hey)
Literacy's your mission (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's why I think it's a good time (Woo!)
To learn some grammar (What)
Now, did I stammer?
Work on that grammar (Woo!)
You should know when
It's ""less"" or it's ""fewer"" (Woo!) (Oh, yeah)

I hate these word crimes
Like ""I could care less"" (Hey, hey, hey)

At least a little
Don't be a moron (Hey, hey)
You'd better slow down
And use the right pronoun (Hey, hey)
Show the world you're no clown

[Verse 2]
Say you've got an ""i-t""
Followed by apostrophe ""s"" (Woo!)
Now, what does that mean?
You would not use ""it's"" in this case (Woo!)
As a possessive (No, no, no!)
It's a contraction (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
What's a contraction?
Well, it's the shortening of a word or a group of words
By omission of a sound or letter (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Okay, now here are some notes
Syntax you're always mangling (Woo!)
No X in ""espresso""
Your participle's danglin' (Uh-huh)
But I don't want your drama (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)
If you really wanna (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)
Leave out that Oxford comma (Hey, hey, hey) (Uh-huh)

[Chorus 2]
Just keep in mind that
""Be"", ""see"", ""are"", ""you""
Are words, not letters (Woo!)
Get it together (Hey, hey)
Use your spell checker
You should never
Write words using numbers (Woo!) (Hey, hey)
Unless you're seven (Yeah-ay)
Or your name is Prince

I hate these word crimes (I hate them crimes)
You really need a (Woo!) (I hate them crimes)
Full-time proofreader (I mean those crimes)
You dumb mouth-breather (Woo!)
Well, you should hire (I'll hire)
Some cunning linguist (Woo!)
To help you distinguish
What is proper English
(Everybody wise up!)

[Bridge]
One thing I ask of you (Okay)
Time to learn your homophones is past due (Woo!)
Learn to diagram a sentence, too
Always say ""to whom"", don't ever say ""to who"" (Woo!)
And listen up when I tell you this
I hope you never use quotation marks for emphasis (Woo!)
You finished second grade, I hope you can tell
If you're doing good or doing well (Woo!)
You better figure out the difference
Irony is not coincidence (Woo!)
And I thought that you'd gotten it through your skull
About what's figurative and what's literal (Woo!)
Oh, but just now (Just now), you said (You said)
You ""literally"" couldn't get out of bed (Woo!) (What?)
That really makes me want to literally
Smack a crowbar upside your stupid head

[Pre-Chorus]
I read your e-mail (Yeah, yeah)
It's quite apparent (Woo!)
Your grammar's errant
You're incoherent (Woo!)
Saw your blog post (Hey, hey)
It's really fantastic (Oh, woah)
That was sarcastic (Oh, psych!)
'Cause you write like a spastic (Woo!)

[Chorus 1]
I hate these word crimes (Everybody wise up)
Your prose is dopey (Woo!) (Hey)
Think you should only (Woah, woah)
Write in emoji (Woo!)
Oh, you're a lost cause (Hey, hey, hey)
Go back to preschool (Woo!)
Get out of the gene pool (Hey, hey, hey)
Try your best to not drool (Woo!)

255,Let It Go,"[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Bridge]
Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be

Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze

257,I Got A Car,"[Verse 1]
She was leaning on a rail in a cotton dress
Summer tanned pretty, little perfect mess
With a story that could only be anybody's guess
And I was thinking that I probably didn't stand a chance
But I rolled up my sleeves, walked up and I said
Hey, I know I don't know you but I'd kinda like a shot
She said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over
And okay, so now what

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I guess I hadn't thought it through that far
But I got a car

[Verse 2]
So, we let the wheels turn and the windows down
We let ourselves go all the way through town
She never said stop and I never asked her why
We drove into the night, when outta nowhere
She said, I'd give anything to never go back there
And I kinda wish this day would never end
She said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin

[Chorus]
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
At least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing
I ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are
And she said, where do you think all this is going
I said, there ain't no way of knowing
I really hadn't thought it through that far
I can't promise you the moon and stars
But I got a car

[Verse 3]
We got lost in the miles, lost track of the days
'Til we finally found a stopping place
When the doctor said, you know what's on the way
And we found ourselves in a little white house
One Sunday morning, rain pouring down
She said, I think it's time but all the lines are out

[Verse 4]
And her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now
And I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something
You think it'll start, I said, it's already running
Got your things in the back and I'm ready when you are
She said, are you sure it'll get us where we're going
I said, if there's one thing I know girl, it's gotten us this far
And I don't mean to hurry but I'm ready when you are",George Strait,2014,"[96, 95, 95, 99, 89, 94, 96]",7

Я танцую на костях, что горят будто косяк
Если был бы я тупее, то купался бы в блядях
Наблюдай как я их утоплю, будто котят
Чтоб ты понял, Сименс — вышка и ебал твоих тян
Блин, и я такой яркий
Блин, кости прячу в парке
Блин, узи в сумке Кархарт

Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled

And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah, it's nothing that no one can tell me

Drinking brown shit now I'm off cup of that
Your girl's on me, what's up with that?
If I like her, all this shit will really take is a double tap
Having visions of fucking an A-list singer, Kardashian, or a Jenner
But Ye's got Kim, Tyga swooped up Kylie
So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah, they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound

Running two door Wraith, I want you with me when I'm swerving
You was with me when I was hitting licks and I was serving
But I ain't gon' lie babygirl you did me dirty
Girl, you did me wrong, did me wrong, wrong, wrong

Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

And love is the prize

And if you fell to your death today

For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love

Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when

[Pre-Chorus]
And my father told me ""son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one""
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing

[Chorus]
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love

[Bridge]
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah",Ed Sheeran,2014,[37],1
276,Demons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside

They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go

Well I just met you a couple hours ago
My last night in town, hey wouldn't you know
I get hooked on a girl with blue diamond eyes
Down here in Mexico, oh
Now you're walking up asking me to dance
Smiling that smile and reaching out your hand
Well there's a move or two, I'd like to show you
While I still got the chance

[Chorus]
Well you got the soul and you know how to use it
Put your hand on my hip cause you know that I'll lose it
You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

Oh oh, why wouldn't I wanna stay?
Oh oh, and let that plane fly away, hey hey

You got my heart racing like there's nothing to it
Falling in love to the beat of the music

Waking up on a beach if you know what I'm saying

Like there is no way out

So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

Please don't like him

I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it

Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did

City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's…

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (That boy good) (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
(Welcome to the bright light, baby)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Jay-Z]
In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel brand-new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh)

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say, ""Yeah"" (come on)
(Come on) Yeah (come on)

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
In New York (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (okay)

285,Sleeping With A Friend,"[Verse 1]
All my friends, they’re different people
Anxious like the ocean in a storm
When we go out, yeah, we’re electric
Coursing through our bodies ’til we’re one

And why mess up a good thing, baby?
It’s a risk to even fall in love
So, when you give that look to me
I better look back carefully
‘Cause this is trouble, yeah this is trouble

[Hook]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood
I’m scared, but if my heart’s gonna break
Before the night will end
I said, ooh, ooh we’re in danger
Sleeping with a friend, sleeping with a friend
Sleeping with a friend

[Verse 2]
All my friends, stay up past midnight
Looking for the thing to fill the void
I don’t go out much like I used to
Something ’bout the strangers and the noise

And why leave when I got you, baby?
It’s a risk but babe, I need the thrill
I never said you’d be easy
But if it was all up to me
I’d be no trouble, hey, we’re in trouble

[Hook]
I said ooh, ooh
You got me in the mood, mood

You would hold me together
Even though I was your baby
You always saw the fight me
When no one there was there to hold my back

You're telling me to choose up, but I already choose you

Lets practice what them text preach
You saying that you chose me
Im 'bout to cancel my plans
I'm saying that I chose we
No matter the season, I wanna fall in it
Let's spring back up, summer salt when I'm with you
Wishing for a winter so I could hibernate till it finish

It's you that went and chose up
But deep and down is your love
Pinot inside of that glass
That's how you winding me up

Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

We are thick and thin 'til our last day
So hold me close and I'll surrender to your heart
You know how to give and how to take
You see every hope I locked away
So pull me close and surrender to my heart

Before the flame goes out tonight
Yeah we'll live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul, into a raging fire?
Come out, come out, come out
'Til we lose control, into a raging fire
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul, into a raging fire?

You know time will give and time will take
All the memories made will wash away
Even though we've changed, I'm still here with you
If you listen close you'll hear the sound
Of all the ghosts that bring us down
Hold on to what makes you feel
Don't let go, it's what makes you real

If the flame goes out tonight
Yeah we'll live until we die

So come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul into a raging fire?
Come out, come out, come out
'Til we lose control into a raging fire
Into a raging fire
Come out, come out, come out
Won't you turn my soul, into a raging fire?

Let the world leave us behind
Let your heart be next to mine
For the flame goes out tonight
We can live until we die

See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down

G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

Just tell me how it's looking, babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower

[Chorus: Future]

Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy

Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
'Til one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

[Chorus: Future]
I just want to take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one

303,Billie Jean,"[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"" (Hee-eeh)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (Ah-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Oh)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son (No-no-no)
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

305,Let Her Go,"[Produced by Mike Rosenberg and Chris Vallejo]
[Video by Dave Jensen and Tavic]

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Yeah girl, been diggin' on you
Sippin' on drink number two
Tryin' to come up with somethin' smooth
And waitin' on the right time to make my move

Can't let you slip out that door
Prettiest thing I ever seen before
Got me spinnin' around, I ain't even on the dance floor

You're shakin' that money maker, like a heart breaker, like your college major was
Twistin' and tearin' up Friday nights
Love the way you're wearin' those jeans so tight (So tight)
I bet your kiss is a soul saver, my favorite flavor, want it now and later
I never seen nothin' that I wanted so bad
Girl, I gotta get me, gotta get me some of that
Yeah, gotta get me some of that

[Verse 2]
Little more what you doin' right there
Swingin' your hips and slingin' your hair
Side to side with your drink in the air
Lord have mercy now, girl, I swear (I swear)
Gotta get your number in my phone
Gotta get me some of you alone (All alone)
We can worry 'bout it later on
Right now keep makin' this my favorite song

307,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

But I can't help falling in love with you

If I can't help falling in love with you

Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

309,Give Me Back My Hometown,"[Verse 1]
Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown

[Verse 2]
All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it

Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse 2]
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me

After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds
Brace yourself, you can't retain me
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me
Logic pickin' up the slack like denim
Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
Step to me, throw disrespect to me
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?—Goddamn
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan
Haters gon' hate, that's the motherfuckin' sayin'
So much plaque up on my wall I need a dentist
From Maryland to Venice, this shit is worldwide
Step up to the mic and it's a homicide

[Chorus 2]
Oh no Bobby, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that
RattPack the gang, they all on my back
RattPack the gang, we do it like that
No, don't do 'em like that
You gon' fuck around and leave 'em ruined like that

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & Eminem]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (Yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm—

[Chorus: Rihanna & (Bebe Rexha)]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it ‘cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—

Thought if I could catch a plane, touch down, out of town
Somewhere nobody knows you
Maybe I could give myself half of a chance
To get a life and act a like a different man

And I found myself hiding in a cheap hotel
Drownin' in the whiskey, starin' at the T.V., tryin' not to sleep
Cause I'm just gonna wake up lovin' you

Yeah I wake up lovin' you, yeah

Yeah I wake up lovin' you
Yeah I wake up lovin' you

Remember when I told you I was never going to stop
Lovin' you with all my heart and soul no matter what

Cause every night I'm desperate
Askin' God if He would just let me forget it

I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
I’m searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to

Burn
Burn

You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you’d done?
She said
“You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun.”

You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you

You, you, you…

I’m erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza
Reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I am watching it
Burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don’t get to know what I said
I’m burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn",Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,2014,"[44, 42, 33, 29, 25, 27, 23, 20, 19, 19, 16, 15, 15, 14, 16, 14, 14, 15, 13, 13, 15]",21

[Verse 1:]
Public thought me a pessimist think my thoughts too pessimistic
Reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am and two-seated
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to God, somebody pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins, just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate but feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys, who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop you jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't meet ya momma but I told her I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too personal, lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens them idiots must don't love life

[Hook]
Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint
While under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off, loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright
Cookin' soft and selling hard while under neon lights

[Verse 2]
Bread Winner Mafia ? we poppin' in climates with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink then it's what I believe
Exploring desires this moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She, grippin' the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now while inside of it hollerin louder she get it with speed
This is we. They say diamonds are forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal girl)
Cling on got the theme song on my ringtone I'mma beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan that I'll have you scared better tell em I'll catch em I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July bout that
And they say diamonds are forever (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal)
From start to finish Go-Karts Assembled sayin life's but a race put the petal to the metal

I was not trying to tear you down

328,How To Love,"[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love

Yea though we ventured through the valley of the stars
You in all your jewelry and my bleeding heart

I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky

Ok, let's go take some shots
Oh no, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine

She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my

Like running my fingers through her long hair
Lighting watermelon candles upstairs
Letting them burn and holding her all night
I like doing what she likes

[Verse 2]
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flying in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushing 95
Doing what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull up somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doing what she likes

She likes hearing how good she looks in them blue jeans

You were California beautiful

It was everything we wanted it to be

The window is open, so's that door

Who knew we owned eight thousand salad plates?
For years I've roamed these empty halls
Why have a ballroom with no balls?
Finally they're opening up the gates

[Pre-Chorus: Kristen Bell]
There'll be actual, real, live people
It'll be totally strange
But, wow, am I so ready for this change

[Chorus: Kristen Bell]
'Cause for the first time in forever
There'll be music, there'll be light
For the first time in forever
I'll be dancing through the night
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy
But I'm somewhere in that zone
'Cause for the first time in forever
I won't be alone

I can't wait to meet everyone!
What if I meet ""the one""?

Tonight, imagine me, gown and all
Fetchingly draped against the wall
The picture of sophisticated grace
Ooh, I suddenly see him standing there
A beautiful stranger, tall and fair
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

[Pre-Chorus: Kristen Bell]
But then we laugh and talk all evening
Which is totally bizarre
Nothing like the life I've led so far

[Chorus: Kristen Bell]
For the first time in forever
There'll be magic, there'll be fun
For the first time in forever
I could be noticed by someone
And I know it is totally crazy
To dream I'd find romance
But for the first time in forever
At least I've got a chance

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel

It's agony to wait (It's agony to wait)
Tell the guards to open up the gate (The gate)

For the first time in forever

Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet

Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!""
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

Its rusty strings across the top

But these dents and scratches in the wood

You see this here flat top guitar
Has had my back in a million bars
Singing every country song

347,Do I Wanna Know?,"[Verse 1]
Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]

I pimps and I mack drive a Benz and a 'lac
Man I've been in the back wit the groupies and the stars
I've been out front with the thugs and the guards
I've been in the yard with the Mexican mafia
And I only run with niggas that'll kill and die for ya
I'm popular, I'm a rap star
But I live like a rock star running from the cop cars
I drop bars wit slaps that knock hard and I charge for this dick extra large
I'm sicker than SARS higher than Mars and I treat my bitch like an ATM card

Man just imagine some of the things we can do
You under me
Me under you
Then we can catch the Liquor store before 2
We can hit my nigga and go get some shrooms
And if you still want to kick it we can go get a room
It won't cost you much, I'm a good buy

Wrapped up, so consumed by
All this hurt
If you ask me, don't
Know where to start
Anger, love, confusion
Roads that go nowhere
I know there's somewhere better
'Cause you always take me there

Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground
Tell me I'm safe, you've got me now

Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?
If I'm lyin' here
Will you take me home?
Could you take care
Of a broken soul?
Will you hold me now?

Hold the gun to my head
Count 1, 2, 3
If it helps me walk away, then it's
What I need
Every minute gets easier
The more you talk to me
You rationalize my darkest thoughts
Yeah you, set them free

Gave me more than a hand to hold
Caught before I hit the ground

358,Odio,"[Letra de ""Odio"" ft. Drake]

[Intro: Drake, Romeo Santos]
Yeah, yeah
Envy is a sign of admiration
Hate: It’s the epitome of destruction

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Tal parece que mi amor crece y crece, pero tú desvaneces
Y  me ofreces tu amistad sin otra excepción
Sé que hay otro hombre que ha logrado lo que yo jamás a ti te di
Un hogar, una familia, un buen porvenir; perdón por hacerte daño

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Verso 2: Drake, Drake & Romeo Santos, Romeo Santos]
Celo sus besos sobre tu cuerpo
La envidia se apodera así de mí y te quiero aquí
Odio ese hombre porque está a tu lado
Perdí tu amor, soy un pobre diablo
Sin tu amor yo no soy nada, nada

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio aunque él te haga feliz
A mí nada me intimida
Pero entiendo que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí

[Interludio: Romeo Santos & Drake]
Escucha las palabras
Yeah, drizzy Drake

[Puente: Romeo Santos]
Yo fui el llanto, él es tu sonrisa (turn the lights on)
Y lo nuestro desplomó sobre un volcán muy de prisa

[Verso 3: Drake]
Uh, you were the one
You've been the one from the moment I seen you
Sometimes I question if this is all real
Then I grab on that ass and I firmly believe it
And you look like you drawn by an artist
No you, you look like Bernice and Yaris
But both put together, those are some girls that I know from back home
If you saw 'em you'd get it
Look don't worry about it, keep speakin' Spanish
I'll get it translated, you know you my baby
Anything for you, anything baby
I do not wanna be enemies baby
I would just much rather give you a baby
And buy you a house, so I live with you baby
Don't stay with this new guy, I really go crazy
I really go crazy

[Coro: Romeo Santos]
Y por ti vivo aniquilado en el despecho
Reprimido, ardiendo por los celos
Lo odio, aunque él te haga feliz
A mi nada me intimida, pero entiendo
Que él gano la guerra hace tiempo
Y se me olvida que ya te perdí",Romeo Santos,2014,"[100, 99, 99, 94, 94, 85, 72, 78, 91, 83, 45]",11
359,Roar,"[Verse 1]
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sat quietly, agreed politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, your hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Get ready cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

[Chorus]
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar
Louder, louder than a lion
'Cause I am a champion, and you’re gonna hear me roar

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You’re gonna hear me roar

Now I’m floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

You held me down, but I got up (Hey)
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up (Got up)
Get ready 'cause I had enough
I see it all, I see it now

But she lied to you if she said I paid for it
Nigga 99 broads, 99 broads
Panoramic view from the 99th floor
I'm like 'my Lord' when she down on all fours
Got a hood bitch with me, she ain't scared of taking charge
Flying by in a car, you ain't know what you saw
She adjusting her bra as I’m lighting up a cigar
They was writing me off, now I arrive like a star
I just sit back and laugh the irony of it all
Let them bands go, let them bands go
Watch a nigga throw a grand or so on that camel toe
And be like 'Damn boy, why you cuffing that whore?'
The whole team smashed her and you ain't even know

All my life has been a series of doors in my face
And then suddenly I bump into you

362,Beating Heart,"[Verse 1]
Eyes make their peace in difficulties
With wounded lips and salted cheeks
And finally, we step to leave
To the departure lounge of disbelief

And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
And I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time
Before daylight

[Verse 2]
And the canyon underneath the trees
Behind the dark sky, you looked at me
I fell for you, like autumn leaves
Never faded, evergreen

And I don't know where I'm going
But I know it's gonna be a long time
Cause I'll be leaving in the morning
Come the white wine, bitter sunlight

[Chorus]
Wanna hear your beating heart tonight
Before the bleeding sun comes alive
I want to make the best of what is left, hold tight
And hear my beating heart one last time

I can't face this, now everything has changed
I just wanna be by your side
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide
Here's hoping we collide

Io faccio lo scemo ma co' lei no, non attacca
Io tipo da Campari, lei da oliva nel Manhattan
La volante passa, stasera tira un'ariaccia
Non ho mai imparato a fare il nodo alla cravatta
Ma tanto tutto passa, forse dovrei cambiare aria
Prendere il primo volo Alitalia
Ubriaco in strada con i miei canto Albachiara
Al distributore senza scheda sanitaria
Io che c’ho solo guai dentro le tasche dei miei Levi's
Vorrei rubare i desideri a Fontana di Trevi
Abbiamo stesso sangue, no, non serve che mi spieghi
Te dimmi dove sei mi faccio tutta Roma a piedi
Il tuo ricordo sfuma, una notte senza luna
Lei si morde un'unghia e fuma
E questa birra è tutta schiuma
Sorrido a mio fratello, siamo su di giri
Fiori cresciuti in mezzo ai sampietrini

[Ritornello: Franco126]
E c’avrei scommesso su noi due
Una vita intera sempre in due
E c’avrei scommesso su noi due
E invece ognuno per le sue

[Strofa 2: Carl Brave]
Sveglia all'alba pe' 'l mercato delle sette
Ho tamponato una mini ferma al verde
Il ragazzino in auto mi fa ""Gne gne gne gne""
Il nasone scorre sempre non la smette
Ho perso il treno poi l'aereo pe' Berlino
Vorrei trasformare questa pioggia in vino
A Nettuno i miei ricordi Polaroid
Ciocco le foto porno di Leotta su un tabloid
Scotch sulla fotocamera del Mac
Non ce la faccio più-uh va bene coffee break
Ho passato mesi a balla’ la techno
Il mio amico veneto mi chiama vecchio
La mia amica che nasconde il sushi nella borsa Gucci
A terra panni sporchi che non stendo (no no no no no)
Un’altra multa di sale che prendo (oh oh oh)

If I don't have you with me, I'm alone
You know I never know which way to go
I think I need you with me for all-time
When I need new direction for my mind
You listen to my lectures on the phone
You help me find the treasure in the hole
You'll tell me if I'm acting like a fool
I know that you're not something to lose, now

[Chorus]
I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use
You're my only compass
I might get lost without you

[Verse 2]
Could you tell me where to go?
You're always there to help me when I'm down
I'm lucky you've been keeping me around
You're the star I look for every night
When it's dark, you'll stick right by my side

I've got something to confess
I keep you in my pocket to use (I keep you in my pocket)
You're my only compass (Yeah)

372,Can't Raise A Man,"[Verse 1]
He got older but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose you
Try to talk to him can't get through
Every day he's a different dude
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

[Verse 2]
Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry?
Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just keeping it real

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man

[Bridge]
Gonna take more than a miracle
To change him just let him go
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man? It's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise

[Chorus]
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you

373,We Might Be Dead By Tomorrow,"Give me all your love now
Cause for all we know
We might be dead by tomorrow

I can't go on wasting my time
Adding scars to my heart
Cause all I hear is ""I'm not ready enough""

And I can tell that you didn't have
To face your mother losing her lover
Without saying goodbye
Without saying goodbye
Cause she didn't have time

I don't want to judge what's in your heart
But if you're not ready for love
How can you be ready for life?
How can you be ready for life?

So let's love fully and let's love loud
And let's love now
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die
Cause soon enough we'll die

Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

For you to salute the true big pimpin'

And my bank account holding 6 digits again
Pour out some Henn'

379,The Devil Is A Lie,"[Verse 1]
A kid up in this church
Kinda scared of what he's hearing
Bloody man up on the wall
So he's staring at the ceiling
He's feeling kinda queasy when they query 'bout communion
He fakes a stomach ache to take away what seems abusive
But if he don't do it they look
Kinda funny, they took
What they want, what they need
To stay hooked, they stay shook
I hate to say that, I hate to see this
But times like this, if I was God I would be heated, so I'm saying:

[Hook]
What if the Devil is a lie then?
I'm not afraid of my sins
I'm gonna ride for my kin
And if I had a God, I'd never die—because I'd bribe him
What if the Devil is a lie then?
I'm not afraid of dying
I'm gonna ride for my kin
And if I had a God, I'd never die—because I'd bribe him

Heavy handed
Get it candid
I'm the man with
Never politic and religion on campus
But when it comes to gettin' educated, you can stamp it
Put in the mail like your God was just a pamphlet
If he's just a pamphlet
Or if she's just a pamphlet
Preaching to a choir 'bout a buyer of enchantment
I ain't buying, I am selling
'Cause the Creflo dollar getting F-Low
Dollars up for [?]
So damn, how we gonna manage?
The coffer is an offer to the author of some panic
And I ain't gonna bow to any damage
You take those lungs and come back with an anthem
So put your motherfucking hands up!

What if the Devil is a lie then?
I'm not afraid of my sins
I'm gonna ride for my kin
And if I had a God, I'd never die—because I'd bribe him
What if the Devil is a lie then?

I'm gonna ride for my kin
And if I had a God, I'd never die—because I'd bribe him

They tell the stories of devils
They tell the stories of levels
Purgatory, the glory
My fury is not disheveled
It's put together by facts
Put it up to the mirror
It breathes heavy, it's loaded
No motive, but I be clear on every song I've ever made
I still have questions
Time machine won't work, we need professors
If the keys won't turn, you need direction
What you work for, son? Let the heathens bless you
Terminology is foul, so it sounds ill
Keeps the people scared, keeps them scarred 'cause they will
Fuck a will, I ain't dying, I ain't trying to keep alive a Frankenstein instead of praying to a giant, uh

380,Glory And Gore,"[Produced by Joel Little]

[Verse 1]
There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (It didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (Go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it, but I promise we're not mean

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Verse 2]
Delicate in every way but one (The swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (The old ways)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

[Pre-Chorus]
And the cry goes out (Oh)
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out (Oh)
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious

[Bridge]
No-one 'round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises: we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's all right if you do, it's fine
We gladiate, but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the killtime comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain:
""Secretly you love this, do you even wanna go free?""
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

[Chorus]
You could try and take us
But we're the gladiators
Everyone a rager
But secretly they're saviours
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines
You could try and take us
But victory's contagious",Lorde,2014,"[90, 68, 88]",3
381,Adrenalina,"[Chorus]
Dobro znam, da ti prija moja blizina
O kako dobro uvijaš mi kukovima
Na to tamno telo, bela posteljina

Dugi nokti po ekranu
Piše mi da želi moje ruke na svom vratu
Kaže ""Ne ostavljaj me samu
Hajde dođi čekam te sama u apartmanu""
A zašto igraš se sa vatrom
Rekla je i đavolu je ponekad hladno
Kad želi mene, želi jako
I mešala bi samo strast i opasnost

Pošalji mi adresu, da pričamo o seksu
Dok ležimo na kešu , o da
U pocepanom vešu kad želje te ponesu
Do mene te donesu, o da
A čini se da si pijana, a baš bi mi takva prijala
Po telu samo kapi viskija, u hotelu ti i ja

Dobro znam, da ti prija moja blizina
O kako dobro uvijaš mi kukovima

They don't know
What I've been through
They don't know the half
They only know what I tell them

[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
They don't know about the brand new car I just bought
They don't know about the brand new house
They don't know about the brand new chick that I just fucked
With some good head, that's a brand new mouth
They don't know about the brand new bezel on the rolex
Now the mufucka got a brand new Glock
They don't know about the brand new choppa for the same old hater
Niggas mad that a nigga can't stop
They don't know about the old school whip that I keep pulled up
When I pull it out they be like ""Who that?""
They don't know about the old school days when a nigga had waves
I swear every night I wore a du-rag
They don't know about the old school days
Magic city, it was jumping, niggas want to see some booty
Got a old school ho trynna screw me
So I'mma hit that pussy from the back, made her scream like (scream)
And it's still money
Over bitches
Rich Homie over all niggas
I need some more commas for these digits
Cuz I done ran my sack up crazy
I might buy my dad a mercedes
And I just found out I got a baby
On the way
I know the situation sound a little crazy
And they ain't know I was worth that much 'till I dropped that mixtape and showed they ass
And they ain't know I was on them Percocet but they know I be on them Xan
And they know I ain't with that groupie shit but got mad love for my fans
I can't take every picture, you've gotta understand
But

They don't know
What I've been through

They only know what I tell them

[Verse 2]
They don't know about the time when a nigga got pulled over
Boy, I swear to God, they was trippin'
They don't know about the bag that a nigga had stuffed in the trunk
They were too busy worried about insurance
They don't know about the homie that I got locked up
Money order every week, they don't know he goin' through it
They don't know I'm a boss already, ain't nothin' but 23
Now them niggas trynna ask me how I do it
They don't know about the pain, pain, pain
That a nigga been goin' through lately baby
Shit done got a little crazy lately
Shoot a nigga, make his ass a grady baby
And that pussy so wet, I might recruit myself in the Navy baby
Used to be George Washington, now it's Ben Franklin
I had a change of face
They don't know about the new spot that I just got
With the cameras everywhere so they see your ass
I'm in New York spending Nino cash
A broke nigga, I can never be your ass
And I'm the future nigga
I see your past
Who the fuck told you I want to be your ass?
With these diamonds lookin' like water
Boy, I've got Nemo mad
And they don't know that my mama still working
They don't know I'm unsigned, they don't know I'm still hustlin'
They knew about the spot on Gresham that my uncle meat had
Two times got busted
They don't know that I paid for my mama to get married
She'll be happy for the rest of her life
That's something I know nigga
And last year I was broke nigga

383,Unconditionally,"[Verse 1]

Oh, did I almost see what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities
All the dirty laundry
Never made me blink one time

[Chorus]
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now
Let go and just be free

384,Waiting For Superman,"[Verse 1]
She's watching the taxi driver, he pulls away
She's been locked up inside her apartment 100 days
She says ""Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the laundromat washing his cape""
She's just watching the clouds roll by and they spell her name
Like Lois Lane
And she smiles, oh, the way she smiles

She's talking to angels, counting the stars
Making a wish on a passing car
She's dancing with strangers, falling apart
Waiting for Superman to pick her up
In his arms, yeah, in his arms, yeah
Waiting for Superman

She's out on the corner trying to catch a glimpse
Nothing's making sense
She's been chasing an answer
A sign lost in the abyss, this Metropolis
She says ""Yeah, he's still coming, just a little bit late
He got stuck at the Five and Dime saving the day
She says, ""If life was a movie, then it wouldn't end like this
Left without a kiss""
Still, she smiles, oh, the way she smiles, yeah

Call it a split cause you know that you will
You bite your friends like chocolate
You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate

I gotta go in
We got a whole lotta new money though
Don't judge, fuck it
Beast mode
Ayy, uh

[Verse]
Raindrop, drop top
I got Migos to pass the weed
I'm not offset, but I set off with the takeoff
Probably why the hottie gotta body like Cardi B
Bob Marley, I pass the weed
Pass the tree, 'cause my lyrics are a masterpiece
You can find me in the house like I'm Ali G
And I got a motherfuckin' ounce like I'm Charlie Sheen (Perfect)
Fuck my ex, I can't stand her, argh
Fuck my friends, I ain't Chandler, argh
First names Blake, not Adam
See me travellin' the longest yards, I'm A. Sandler, argh
I was in a hotel loungin'
Me and Baggsy were smokin' cones
And now I'm tryna get a bag on my broken phone
I'm livin' like a rockstar like I'm Post Malone
Slow down one time, baby, let's go
Heck no, I'm tryna put a house up in escrow
I just wanna get a Ying Yang Twin
Then show 'em my Lil Jon till the girls wanna get low (Yeah!)
I'm the one to put a bar in the underground
You motherfuckers better make your thanks
When it comes to the dollar, dollar bills
Yeah, Chillin' get all the money, I'm a Saint George bank
(Perfect) Woo, woo, find me at a rave
Gettin' blazed with the kush and I'm lookin' for a pill hit
Got the gloves at the back
With the ball, my brother, I ain't never Adam Gilchrist
Only my Don Bradman would get that
The bender it goes five days: test match
This ain't the Basement Jaxx
But ""Where's your head at?""
Ha, stay in the cut with the sesh lad
Call up my crew, ""Where the sesh at?""
If it's your wife we don't text back
Arnie Schwarzenegger, I flex rap
Hit the forty, Rick and Morty
Fly through space, stay high with a jetpack
Swear that your bitch is boring, switch the story
You might end in the place where my ex at (Perfect)
I'm a man, bruv, I do what a man does
So I do it for my man then my man up
I grew up not fuckin' with the mainstream
'Cause I had Big L rockin' on my Samsung
You can't be damn stupid
Brother, I'm Chill, don't ask your man, ""Who's this?""
I jump on the Gram, I pass the damn doobie
I smoke me a spliff like Armin Van Buren
No money, so I skip my rent
See Jackson high all the time like 50 Cent
I ain't ever done Muay Thai
But I still get high with my homies that hit the legs
All of you faggots are soundin' American
Bruv, I'm the pimp at your party
Check out this Aussie that's swaggin'
With Nautica jackets and shrimps on the barbie (Perfect)
These days I'm sippin' the cheap whiskey
Till the day that I die I'll be high
No surprise, I ain't givin' a fuck, it seems risky
I'll overdose on Nurofen Plus like 360
I was under satan's spell
But Blake rebelled, the drugs I would take as well
I blazed the L, then stare up at the face of hell
That make a motherfucker laugh like I'm Dave Schapelle
Look back at it, oh my God
Wu-Tang Clan's playin' on my iPod
Got a white girl in some lingerie
She pass J’s with her arse in my face and the lights on

Argh, I can't even breath, bro. Fuck it, that's it. One take. 420 fam. Bodybag Media. Deadthread (Perfect) (Smoke weed every day) Ah, pack me up. Call me a stripper, shit, I'm fucked. That was harder than I thought",ChillinIt,2014,"[43, 28, 28, 38, 41, 40, 38, 48, 48, 51, 53]",11

""But I'm only going to get this one chance."" (Six minutes— Six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it."" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got. Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what.

""You are just what the doc ordered.""

[Chorus]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody wants the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you'll be Thor, I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?",Eminem,2014,"[67, 58, 59, 58, 55, 53, 51, 46, 46, 33, 38]",11

And I say too much, yeah, that's true
So just listen to what I do

[Interlude 1]
A thousand years go by
But love don't die

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die

[Bridge]
You can break it up, you can burn it down
You can box it in, bury it in the ground
You can close it off, can turn it away
Try to keep it down six feet in the ground
But love don't die

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side
Love don't die
No matter where we go
Or even if we don't
And even if they try
They'll never take my body from your side

Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]

We can stay forever young

Just take your time

Guess I need you, and I need to

Skim milk, white bread
Done my homework weeks ahead
Skipping stones and best friend bracelets
Lemonade, I like to make it
Love recycling, mountain biking, let's go hiking
Made sure your shoes are tied

391,The Heart Of Dixie,"(Verse 1)
She had a dead-end job at the National Bank
And a deadbeat husband who always drank
So when he didn't come home she had the gin to thank
For the tears in her eyes
So Dixie packed up and said her goodbyes and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Verse 2)
It's a funny thing when your world falls down
It's got a way of showing you what you're all about
Now Dixie's got her wheels pointed south
And she ain't never looking back
Nobody knew she was brave like that and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

(Bridge)
Yeah Dixie woke up to the truth one day
Grabbed her cheap sunglasses and her lipstick case and she went

(Chorus)
Driving so far away nobody's gonna find her
Flying just fast enough to leave it all behind her
But she didn't know till she hit the road deep in her soul
She's got the fire and the fight of a gypsy
Ain't nothing stronger than the heart of Dixie
The heart of Dixie

Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]

402,White Walls,"[Intro: Macklemore]
I wanna be free
I wanna just live
Inside my Cadillac
That is my shit
Now throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (that’s what it is)
In my C-A-D-I-L-L-A-C, bitch (biatch)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Can’t see me through my tints (nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint, wet, dripping, shining like my 24s (umbrella)
I ain’t got 24s (nuh-uh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like Olde English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, damn y’all mad
30K on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Man, I’m lounging
In some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? Illegally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking, bucking them out here
I’m looking fucking fantastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whip but never one like this
Old school, old school, candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, there’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really wanted a Caddy so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car I dreamed of, placed a bargain with this geezer
Got the keys in as I was leaving I started screaming

[Chorus: Hollis]
I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m rolling that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snortin' coke
She doing line after line like she's writing rhymes
I had her inhalin' my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin', my uncle was on
14, I stole his keys, me and my niggas was gone
Stealing portions of his liquor, water in his Patron
Driving smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it, and the Vogues too
Mustard and mayonnaise, keepin' the buns all on
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fucking like we ball
Tryna fuck 'em all
Never park the whip, see what's poppin' at the mall
Meet a bad bitch, slap her booty with my paw
You can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I'm motherfuckin' awe-
-some, swear these sights tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes
Maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low?
'Cause this shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cruise for minutes, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted, for sure a gangsta in it
Slide 'til the gas is finished

It happened cause I'm sippin' on that good Kentucky whiskey
It happened cause I'd rather be lucky, than good

406,Explosions,"[Verse 1]
You trembled like you'd seen a ghost
And I gave in
I lacked the things you need the most
You said, ""Where have you been?""
You wasted all that sweetness to run and hide
I wonder why
I remind you of the days you poured your heart into
But you never tried
I've fallen from grace
Took a blow to my face
I've loved and I've lost
I've loved and I've lost

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Verse 2]
You left my soul bleeding in the dark
So you could be king, ah
The rules you set are still untold to me
And I've lost my faith in everything
The nights you could cope
Your intentions were gold
But the mountains will shake
I need to know I can still make

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same

[Bridge]
And as the floods move in
And your body starts to sink
I was the last thing on your mind
I know you better than you think
Because it's simple, darling, I gave you a warning
Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces
So watch them fall with you, in slow motion
I pray that you will find peace of mind
And I'll find you another time
I'll love you, another time

[Chorus]
Explosions on the day you wake up
Needing somebody and you've learned
It's okay to be afraid
But it will never be the same
It will never be the same",Ellie Goulding,2014,[100],1

Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?

Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it

409,Midnight Memories,"[Verse 1: Harry]
Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh but we don't listen

[Pre-Chorus: Louis]
Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh whoa

410,Sweet Annie,"[Verse 1]
I've been burning bright
For so long I can't remember
Pretty girls and late night bars seem to be my line of work
Believe me when I say, I can't stay this high forever
This man has had all he can stand, time to lay this body down

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
Sweet Annie

[Verse 2]
Sweet Annie
I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said don't carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and I'd pray it's not too late

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me
What will be will be
Sweet Annie

[Verse 3]
Turn out the light
These hands they long to hold you
Fall all over you
All over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over, and over again

[Chorus]
Sweet Annie
Can I stay with you a while?
'Cause this road's been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been living in a fantasy
But one day, lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite
But don't give up on me

411,Up All Night,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it

I mean, we can't even rock them shoes

I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)
Aww, aww, aww

412,Follow Your Arrow,"[Verse 1]
If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[Verse 2]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatever you want

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse 3]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em don't mean you should join 'em

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Bridge]
Say what you think, love who you love
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
Only live once

[Chorus]
So, make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points",Kacey Musgraves,2014,[60],1
413,m.A.A.d City,"[Part I: Produced by Sounwave]

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck!""
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song

Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?

Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that",Kendrick Lamar,2014,[75],1
414,A Man Who Was Gonna Die Young,"[Verse 1]
I like fast cars and sharp dreams
Chased a lot of crazy things
Left behind my share of broken pieces
This morning I turned 36
When you just remember half of it
You wonder how you outlived Hank and Jesus

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 2]
In the mirror I saw my surprise
Who knew gray hairs liked to hide on a head
That didn't think he'd live past thirty
If I make it thirty more
It's the brown that you'll be looking for
As you run your fingers through it and say
""Slow down, honey.""

[Chorus]
I put the rage in a river, the roll in a thunder
But you kept me from goin' under
When that current got too heavy
I always thought I'd be a heap of metal
In a cloud of smoke, foot stuck to the pedal
Sold for parts like a junkyard rusted-out Chevy
Fear, I've had none
What the hell made you wanna love
A man who was gonna die young

[Verse 3]
Call it intuition, or call it crazy
Just thought by now I'd be pushing up daisies
But I'll gladly stick around if we're together
So baby, when you bow your head tonight
Could you tell the Lord I've changed my mind?
And with you I'd like to live forever",Eric Church,2014,[89],1

I went ahead and called you up
I got a little drunk last night

Heart was talking way too loud
I don't remember what I said
I just remember breaking down

432,Survival,"[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all

So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all",Eminem,2014,"[74, 77, 64, 96]",4
433,Berzerk,"[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

440,Perfume,"[Verse 1]
Do I imagine it, or do I see your stare?
Is there still longing there?
Oh, I hate myself and I feel crazy
Such a classic tale
Current girlfriend, ex girlfriend
I'm trying to be cool
I'm being paranoid, am I seeing things?
Am I just insecure?

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume

[Verse 2]
I wanna fill the room, when she's in it with you
Please, don't forget me
Do I imagine it, or catch these moments?
I know you got history
But I'm your girlfriend, now, I'm your girlfriend trying to be cool
I hope I'm paranoid, that I'm just seeing things
That I'm just insecure

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to believe
It's just you and me
Sometimes it feels like there's three
Of us in here, baby

[Chorus]
So, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory
So I, I wait for you to call
And I try to act natural
Have you been thinking 'bout her or about me?
And while I wait, I put on my perfume
Yeah, I want it all over you
I gotta mark my territory

[Post-Chorus]
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll never tell, tell on myself
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume
I'll hide it well, hope you can't tell
But I hope she smells my perfume",Britney Spears,2014,"[92, 91, 90]",3
441,Bounce It,"[Intro: Juicy J]
Yeah, yeah, we gon' stay trippy for life, mane
Yeah, I'm 'bout to take your girl
Bounce it
Check it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand, thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I love the way she slow dance, she make me throw more bands
Grabbin' ass with both hands, she in love with the dope man
She wanna be my main chick, I was thinkin' different
Clap that ass, light our blunt, baby, let’s get ig'nant
She’s strips for the Gs, rake cash like leaves
She got double Ds, and ain’t shit free
Came with my goons but I’m leavin' with a diva
With an ass like Serena and a face like Aaliyah
Redbone in some red bottoms
She ain’t finished college, she a head doctor
Bouncin ass while I’m gettin' high as propellers on a helicopter
Let’s do it again, me, you and your friend
We don’t even need a room, give me head up in my Benz
Where my double cup? Time to pour it up
Got a bitch so bad you can’t afford to fuck, bounce it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand, thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Wale though, le'go)
Hands is on her you know what
'Cause bands a make her you know what
And I can make a girl break fast
My pants be on that too much lunch
And I’m ’bout whatever baby, take a photo, I’m lookin' good
And these breezies are so beneath you, understand you’re misunderstood
Premium leather goods, we pay whatever for it
Over these pussy niggas, only under influence
Throw a block up then I back out, like that
Roll a pack out, took a light hit, might nap
Got a thick bitch with a trip stick I’ma smack
And a bucket but we nothin' but tatted
Bald-headed scallywags, real niggas salute me
Catch me at that Memphis game, seats saved by Rudy
Or Marc Gasol, or Selby do, that’s plenty dough
That’s Juicy J, Folarin, got it then get me those, Ralph

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand, thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it

Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Turn up, Juicy be trippy and paid up like Diddy
Toss up that cash and she show me her kitty
Got some white girl and a white girl
Do a Montana line off of her titty
Ain’t tryna fuck, I just found a replacement
Feelin' so global, I think I need Asian
Ratchet on deck and they know I’m gon’ stunt
I’m tryna get head while smokin' a blunt
Take her to my hotel, beat the pussy up
I don’t know her name, but I wanna fuck
Along came Molly, then came Doobie
Then codeine in a Styrofoam cup
See me in the club, bands pop, they poppin'
Do it real good, might take you shoppin'
All these racks can’t fit in my pocket
Keep that stack, hundred K in the stockin'
Then it’s back to my room, she come out her dress
Slob on my knob, think you know the rest
I don’t buy these broads Nike, but I keep these girls in check
Workin' for that money, bitch, you gon’ have to break a sweat, bounce it

[Hook: Trey Songz & Juicy J]
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand, thousand
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand
Ones, fives, tens, twenties
Work your way up to them big face hundreds, just bounce it
Bounce it, bounce it, bounce it, bounce it
I’m about to throw a couple thousand

442,Everybody's Got Somebody But Me,"[Verse 1: Hunter Hayes]
I wish the couple on the corner would just get a room
Seems like everyone around me's on their honeymoon
I'd love to take a pin to a heart-shaped balloon
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Verse 2: Jason Mraz]
I don't know how I landed on this movie set
It's like a casting call for 'Romeo and Juliet'
I never woulda noticed if we'd never met
But everybody got somebody but me

[Chorus: Hunter Hayes]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 3: Hunter Hayes & Jason Mraz]
I hear love songs playing on the radio
People slow dancing everywhere I go
Well, I'm a good slow dancer, but you'd never know
'Cause everybody's got somebody but me
Yeah, they do
Everybody's got somebody

[Chorus: Hunter Hayes & Jason Mraz]
And I miss you
Without you, I just don't fit in
I know we're through
But I'm wishing we could try it again

[Verse 4: Hunter Hayes with Jason Mraz]
Sittin' here lonely at a table for two
Watching lovers being lovers in the corner booth
Seems like even cupid don't know what to do
Everybody's got somebody but me

[Bridge: Hunter Hayes with Jason Mraz]
Yeah, I don't know if I'll ever find another you
But everybody's got somebody but me
Everybody, got somebody
Oh everybody, everybody, everybody but me now

443,Old School Love,"[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school

Already got one, rolled up in my left hand
Pussy on my mind, tighter than a headband
Kush in my lungs, got ganja in my sweat glands
This shit I'm on, better than the next strand
Than the next strand, better than the next strand
She head down, booty poppin' in a handstand
I shine bright, I'll give your girl a slight tan
I make that pussy whistle like the Old Spice man
I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a fuck, that's a misconception
Oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high

Day you can fuck with me, that would be Neveruary
Dead ass rapper should have came with a cemetery
I am so cold, nigga like Ben & Jerry
Fill a nigga, deal a nigga, kill a nigga, obituary
My vision blurry, these bitches flirtin'
I've been drinking all night, I think my kidney's hurtin'
So I closed the curtains on the 62
Her ass would knock your ass out, you better stick and move
Chain hang to my ding-a-ling
Chain hang, chain hang to my ding-a-ling
To do a threesome you gotta intervene
Her legs so sexy when I'm in-between

Be cautious, that booty is bigger than it appears
She speed it up or slow it down, like she's switching gears
I'm looking for the baddest one here
I tell her like, do that there, do that there
You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there
Like hut one, hut two, girl who back there?
Who back there? I'm back there
I could take a step back and sip my cognac there
Picture perfect body, that's a Kodak there

Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Brenda Lee]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

[Chorus: Kanye West, Ponderosa Twins Plus One, & Brenda Lee]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey

452,The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You),"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard sleeping tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although It's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you",Stevie Wonder,2014,[45],1
453,Who You Love,"[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer]
That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry & John Mayer]
When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Pre-Chorus: John Mayer & Katy Perry]
Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love

[Chorus: John Mayer]
Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love

[Outro: Katy Perry]
It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I love",John Mayer,2014,[48],1
454,Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,"[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Bridge]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly -
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!""

[Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way",Brenda Lee,2014,[50],1
455,I Have Nothing,"[Verse 1]
Share my life, take me for what I am
Because I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
I can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love, I'll remember forever

[Chorus]
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me

[Outro]
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you
If I don't have you, oh you",Whitney Houston,2014,[51],1

457,Slow Down,"[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Clyde Carson]
(I tell 'em…) Aye, I'm on the case getting sideways
Dolla fo' five on the highway
You know a nigga state to state
On a dolo mission, I got a date with the cake
Wide awoke, 3 A.M
Prolly touch down when the sun come in
Aye, when them guards hit the gate
I be tired as fuck after that 8-hour race
I come from the land where we swing our cars
Figure 8 Benz concrete leave marks
Call it paid, super-charged
Back to back race the Benz with the four door Porsche
I'm tearin' up tires in this luxury
Hella smoke says she wanna fuck with me
Money on my mind, ain't nothin' for free
Tryna keep up with me, but it's nothin' to me

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 2: Kaz Kyzah]
(I tell 'em…) Slow down, you know you can't catch me
Hype without fugitive; Snipes Wesley
Fuzz get on me, tried to test me, arrest me
Wetter than a mothafucka, whip like a jet ski
Ride like Presley, pills like Graceland
They wanna ship me to Rita and off to reception
Nah, ain't tryna see the state pen
I'm Black Scaled out in my Ray-Bans
Diamond-certified, I ain't never lied
I ain't had L's since Pac died
Ridin' through the biters
Couple bundles talking 'bout sliders
Run from the labors, mind's still swift
FedEx movement all on the bitch
Audi with the stash box, Cazzy too swift
No frontin', push a button, give a nigga that gift

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 3: Mayne Mannish]
I'm Jeff Gordon in his heyday
Ridin' like Tony Stewart smashing through a two-way
Doing 'bout a hundred, kinda burnin' up the Louis
Louis, Louis 13th mothafucka, yeah, Louis
D.U.I. drivin' black, Henny on my lap
Pedal to the floor, with a 808 clap
Money motivated, doing sprints when I'm chasin'
And it gotta be a hemi, I don't normally do the basic
Six-cylinder, r-really, bruh? Slow it down, keep up
And I'm killin' ya, hope I'm not offendin' ya
See you at the finish line, leavin' em
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber
This is how we do it when I'm dippin' on a corner
Burn rubber, bu-burn rubber
This is how we do it in Northern California

[Hook]
I tell 'em, slow down
You know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down",Clyde Carson,2014,[69],1
458,Let It Be,"[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
