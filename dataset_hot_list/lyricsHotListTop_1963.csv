Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

1,There! I've Said It Again,"(Love you, love you)
I love you, there’s nothing to hide
It’s better than burning inside
I love you, no use to pretend
There I’ve said it again
I’ve said it, what more can I say
Believe me, There’s no other way
I just love you and will to the end
There I’ve said it again

I tried to drum up
A frase that would sum up
All that I feel, that I feel for you
But what good are frazes
The thought that amazes
Is you love me and it’s so heavenly
Forgive me, for wanting you so
There’s one thing I want you to know
[?] and that I love you so

3,Since I Fell For You,"When you just give love, and never get love
You'd better let love depart

I know it's so, and still I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love, and now you've gone
Since I fell for you ...

My life has been such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you ...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get these blues most every night
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light

All you need is for love to go wrong

Or to lie awake the whole night long

When you leave me
My golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart
That's full of tears

These ain't raindrops in my eyes
Why should I lie
You don't have to be a baby to cry

When you leave me
My golden rainbow disappears
And you leave me a broken heart

Forget him if he doesn’t love you, forget him if he doesn’t ca-a-a-a-are

So don’t you cry now, just tell him goodbye now
Forget him and please come home to me

Shaky legs don't just stand there

Don't let her know that she's getting through with you
Talk back trembling lips
Burning eyes don't start crying
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two

Everyday our love's a battle royal
Dear, it seems that fighting's all we do
But if I let you know how much I love you
You'll do things to me you shouldn't do so

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there

Every time you up and hurt my feelings
I pretend it couldn't matter less
I'm just hiding all of my emotions
Behind my broken heart I guess so

Talk back trembling lips
Shaky legs don't just stand there
Heart don't let her know that you're breaking in two",Ernie Ashworth,1963,"[9, 11, 18, 26, 31, 42, 59, 91]",8

Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now

With a letter in front

When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back

Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly
Be true to your school

On Friday, we'll be jacked up
On the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash 'em now

My girl will be working
On her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

So be true to your school now
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
And let your colors fly

Makin' bad decisions how we beggin', and you love it

Okay now picture little Bobby just a youngin' runnin' round
With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man
Run, mothafucka, run

Everything you talk about I know I can live without it

Well I'll be God damned, go figure
In my blood is the slave and the master
It's like the devil playin' spades with the pastor
But he was born with the white privilege!
Man, what the fuck is that?
White people told me as a child, as a little boy, playin' with his toys
I should be ashamed to be black
And some black people look ashamed when I rap
Like my great granddaddy didn’t take a whip to the back
Not accepted by the black or the white
I don't give a fuck, praise God, I could see the light
Everybody talkin' 'bout race this, race that
I wish I could erase that, face facts

[Verse 1]
Crowded streets, busy feet hustle by you
Downtown shoppers Christmas is nigh
There he sits all alone on the sidewalk
Hoping that you won't pass him by

[Verse 2]
Should you stop? Better not much too busy
You better hurry, my how time does fly
And in the distance the ringing of laughter
And in the midst of the laughter he cries

[Chorus]
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue
Wrap your presents to your darling from you
Pretty pencils to write I love you
Pretty paper, pretty ribbons of blue

19,As Usual,"[Intro]
You know how we do
Roc-A-Fella... forever...

[Verse 1]
You can catch me
Skatin' through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin'
No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, tryin' to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greetin' me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursin' the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, winter's here, I'm tryin' to feel mink, nigga

[Chorus]
Politics as usual

[Verse 2]
I took my Frito to Tito in the district
Blessed me with some VS
Somethings I can live with: stop frontin'
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true
I'm takin' wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice
I'm smokin' bros who pump Willie, I expose
The furthest you Chiles been is the Poconos
My portfolio reads: leads to Don Corleone, nigga please
10-year felon, heavy on the wrist, I faze yous
With the diamond flooded Jesus and blind your facials
For life, right, it's Jigga, I keep it tight nigga

[Chorus]
Politics as usual

[Verse 3]
You feel my triumph never - feel my pain
I'm lyin' low in the leathers, I am, the best that's ever came
The game changes like my mind just ain't right
Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember
Tellin' my family: ""I'll be back soon""; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Chick baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin'
The drawers from droppin', the law from watchin' - I hate 'em

25,Wonderful Summer,"(Summer of 2012
Had my early obsessions, but no investments
Heard my friends at the time
Talk and screencap and joke about some weird show
One day I got up and decided - with no real reason why -
That I'd give it a try.)

Not much to do aside from being asleep
Went through both seasons - took me only two weeks
Get me some Flex Tape - I think my brain formed a leak
Didn't fret the same with laugh lanes so deep
Bo Peep gon' weep - didn't need her sheep to sleep anymore
Rejuvenated - 110% Juice in the morn'
Not stuck in the Backyard - I might be stuck online
Watching this pone show and missin' my wind-chimes
And deadlines and fold-clothes and bed-times -
I no-showed and fed lies
To those Jones and led life
With a smile
I guess I was a child
Who needed some light
In a life rife with cynicism
Missin' the kind
Of mysticism and wonders delight
From a dumb show about a horse in the night -
Of course set a course to ripen my mind
Not the kind of guy to find this kinda stuff appealin'
'til I peeled my mind open and reached a new ceiling
For days I was dazed - I was feign-blessed
'till this thing came around - gave me a rain check
No loud sounds, no cloud I was under -
Sun's out, it's a wonderful summer
Friends were pinpricks I didn't miss
'till I fell in - I was livin' it
Formed cliques and I learned how to love 'em
'cause I flicked a vid that wonderful summer
Always wanted to make stuff to wow others -
Never had the means to mean more than a lover
Now I've had a mass of crowds to be in front of
I'm still proud of that wonderful summer
This community planted the seeds in me - the weeds in me
These needs to please in me
Too fond to leave - too much to suffer:
The bond I weaved that wonderful summer
Heard the music they were pumpin' out their orifices
Or I missed it - too many stolid stories were told in pictures
Told in tunes. Born a witness to this mystic-
-al addiction formed attuned. Been aboard a burning cruise or two
In this cornucopia storm amused
This is my muse to abuse
My flex to reflex
Rode [HORSE] to the vertex - coursed coarse like a Blank Check
I could never make set 'cause my words felt worthless
Now I've gone on a limb -
Take Hoofy to the gym
Not like some Eevee EV or Eevee CP or CP; like ZD's PP
Not missin' a smedium - spirit hard with no tedium;
Pick on a Picard or Picardy - lightspeed when I'm beamin' 'em
The BBs see me be the worst in fandom
But then they be RCT3's first expansion
Buddy boy, I'm blasting love like a cantrip - can't miss -
Too much ish from this pilgrimage - can't skip
No loud sounds, no cloud I was under -
Sun's out, it's a wonderful summer
Formed cliques and I learned how to love 'em
'cause I flicked a vid that wonderful summer
Now I've had a mass of crowds to be in front of
I'm still proud of that wonderful summer
Too fond to leave - too much to suffer:
The bond I weaved that wonderful summer

(It's been 7 years for me
That's a massive chunk of my life that's set in stone forever
No matter how much I lose interest
No matter how much I may move away
This community and this identity will always have its place in me

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress

You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel

But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

He never drank water, he always drank wine

His bridle was silver, his mane it was gold
And the worth of his saddle has never been told

Oh the fairgrounds were crowded, and Stewball was there
But the betting was heavy on the bay and the mare

And a-way up yonder, ahead of them all
Came a-prancin' and a-dancin' my noble Stewball

I bet on the grey mare, I bet on the bay
If I'd have bet on ol' Stewball, I'd be a free man today

Oh the hoot owl, she hollers, and the turtle dove moans
I'm a poor boy in trouble, I'm a long way from home

36,Whispering,"[WENDLA]
Whispering
Hear the ghosts in the moonlight
Sorrow doing a new dance
Through their bone, through their skin

Listening
To the souls in the fool's night
Fumbling mutely with their rude hands
And there's heartache without end

See the father bent in grief
The mother dressed in mourning
Sister crumbles, and the neighbors grumble
The preacher issues warnings

History
Little miss didn't do right
Went and ruined all the true plans
Such a shame. Such a sin

Mystery
Home alone on a school night
Harvest moon over the blue land
Summer longing on the wind

Had a sweetheart on his knees
So faithful and adoring
And he touched me. And I let him love me
So let that be my story

Listening
For the hope, for the new life
Something beautiful, a new chance

39,When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes,"[Verse 1]
He gave me the eye
But I just passed him by
I treated him unkind
But he didn't seem to mind
I told him be on his way
But not a word did he say
He just stood there kind of bold
While I acted cold

[Chorus 1]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize I should apologize
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart

[Verse 2]
So I quickly apologized
Hoping he hadn't changed his mind
But not a word did he say
So I turned to walk away

[Chorus 2]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart

[Instrumental]
Ooh-wa!

[Verse 3]
When he asked could he walk my way
I hoped sweet things he'd say
Instead, he smiled kind of nice
As he held my hand kind of tight

[Chorus 2]
But when the lovelight starts shining through his eyes
Made me realize how he felt inside
And when he placed a kiss upon my face
Then I knew
Oh, then I knew
That he won my heart

Gdy przedwieczorne złote słońce
Rozpala serca czułym pocałunkiem
Ostrzegam przed niebezpieczeństwem
Cytując Biblię z nabożeństwem
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Ochrzczono mnie Loretta
Ale wolę imię Lotta
Mam lat piętnaście choć mi więcej dają
Niebrzydkie oczy mam zielone
I jasne włosy rozpuszczone
Chłopaki już się za mną oglądają
Lecz skromna jestem i nieśmiała
Pobożnie mama mnie chowała
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Musiałeś słyszeć że zawisła nad Millhaven klątwa
Tu w okolicy wiedzą o niej wszyscy
Syn Blake'a - Billy gdzieś zaginął
Nim go znaleźli tydzień minął
Utonął - w rozpacz wpadli jego bliscy
Był płacz i skargi do Maryi
Bo chłopak kamień miał u szyi
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Zwariował ksiądz O'Rye
Gdy swego psa zobaczył
Przygwożdżonego do drzwi audytorium
Znów w mieście wrzało od sensacji
Bo stary klecha zwłok kremacji
Dokonać w szkolnym chciał laboratorium
Gdy zabierali go w kaftanie
Wygłaszał lejąc łzy kazanie
Tra la la tra la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Millhaven było w szoku, ludzie z domu wyjść się bali
Wciąż wymyślano hipotezy nowe
Ucichło wszystko, dobry Boże
Ucichło, jakby uciął nożem
Gdy znalazł ktoś Handymana ściętą głowę
W fontannie miejskiej się pluskała
Lecz nigdy nie wykryto ciała

Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Następnie stara panna Colgate ducha wyzionęła
Gliniarze przyjechali jednak prędko
I nim się z Bogiem połączyła
Z ostatnim tchnieniem wyrzęziła
""Zabiła mnie Loretta własną ręką""
Krew właśnie sczesywałam z włosów
Gdy wpadła grupa komandosów
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Nazwano mnie pomiotem diabła i przekleństwem miasta
A to Millhaven mnie przyniosło pecha
Niebrzydkie oczy mam zielone
I jasne włosy rozpuszczone
I ładne usta, kiedy się uśmiecham
Padnijcie wszyscy na kolana
Najprostszą drogę znam do Pana
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

To śledztwo jest przygnębiające i niesprawiedliwe
Jak śmiecie karać mnie w imieniu prawa?
Nie dla mnie ziemskie namiętności
Ja przekroczyłam próg wieczności
Najlepiej wiem, że śmierć to nie zabawa
Nad światem dzwon żałobny dzwoni
Więc niech was ręka boska broni
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

To ja Billy'ego utopiłam, a dźgając pannę Colgate
Niestety zawahałam się przez chwilę
Lecz gdy Handymana oprawiałam
Szczęśliwa byłam, bo widziałam
Słoneczny poblask na tarczowej pile
Psa jednak nie ukrzyżowałam
Z religii zawsze szóstkę miałam
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Gdy się przyznałam do wszystkiego przed przysięgłych ławą
Prasa okrzyknęła mnie wampirem
Palcami włosy przeczesałam
Sędziemu w oczy spoglądałam
Nie jestem przecież pierwszym lepszym świrem
Psychiatria mieści się w klasztorze
Na Twoją chwałę, Wielki Boże
Tra la la tra la la la...
Nie znasz dnia ani godziny - tylko Bóg je zna

Na co dzień jestem dość spokojna
Lekarz mi pomaga
Gdy wpadam czasem w depresyjne stany
Elektrowstrząsy lub hipnoza
Złoty lek na wszystko - Prozac
I znów snuć mogę euforyczne plany
O wyzdrowieniu szybkim marzę
Jak wyjdę jeszcze wam pokażę

I see blood, I want blood like the reaper
Run up that check and take care of my people
Collect them bodies, I swear I'm a demon
I pour a five of that Act in a liter
Run up the money with all my brothers
Up with that Glock and I shot it in public
Say that she love me, I know she don't love me
Straight out the north, I'll never stop thuggin'
Sosa come in, pull up with the drank for me
Walk in the mall, and I'm spendin' your budget
Label gave me a whole lotta money

This fortune and fame ain't rented
I'm lovin' this pain I'm feelin'
I'm way outta range, I'm winnin'
I wanted a bite, and I bit it
Had to jump out a plane and get it
Lay on top of that rank commitment

50,Daisy Petal Pickin',"Hook:
With a little bit of hope; maybe i can cope...
Find the right path & stop slipping down these slopes
With a little bit of hope; i won't need dope...
To get this off my chest; & just see through the smoke
With a little bit of hope; maybe i can go...
Get on with my life and find the girl i want most
With a little bit of hope; she won't even know...
That i'm the one for her until she loves me so!

Verse 1: (Clarky)
You ever get that feeling; when you're sleeping but you're hot?
You try to keep on dreaming; but it's feeling like it flopped?
Like you woke up for a reason; you were hot & now you're freezing
So now them thoughts are freaking; cause its seeming like a lot!
It's like i'm feeding demons every time these thoughts are creeping;
Time's gone through the seasons; still these feelings won't stop...
She's thieving; call the cops; stole my heart 'oopsy daisy'
Picking petals; love-me-nots...
She's stealing all that's beating; and replacing it with loss;
Cause she was the air i'm breathing; girl i'm seeing; then she's gone
She's not easy; but it's fun, fam this girl might be the one!
Call it easing into love; i'm just keeping it at lust;
But she's keeping it at hugs; my hearts bleeding for her trust!
Doubt i'll ever get her back; nor see her how i was;
I'm fiending for her; must, i keep pleading to these gods?
I guess i gotta keep my hope; and hope i get the girl i want!

I'm a wreck, I'm out of time

I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

[Pre-Chorus: Matt]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

[Chorus: Matt]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

[Verse 2: Mark & Matt]
Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus: Matt]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started

54,The Marvelous Toy,"When I was just a wee little lad
Full of health and joy
My father homeward came one night
And gave to me a toy
A wonder to behold it was
With many colors bright
And the moment I laid eyes on it
It became my heart's delight

[Refrain:]
It went ""Zip"" when it moved and ""Pop"" when it stopped
""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will

The first time that I picked it up
I had a big surprise
Cause right on the bottom were two big buttons
That looked like big green eyes
I first pushed one and then the other
Then I twisted its lid
And when I set it down again, here is what it did:

[Refrain]

It first marched left, and then marched right
And then marched under a chair
And when I looked where it had gone
It wasn't even there
I started to cry, but my daddy laughed
'Cause he knew that I would find
When I turned around my marvelous toy
Would be chugging from behind

[Refrain]

The years have gone by too quickly it seems
I have my own little boy
And yesterday I gave to him
My marvelous little toy:
His eyes nearly popped right out of his head
And he gave a squeal of glee!
Neither one of us knows just what it is
But he loves it just like me!

But still it goes ""Zip"" when it moved and ""Pop"" when it stopped
""Whirrr"" when it stood still
I never knew just what it was and I guess I never will",The Irish Rovers,1963,"[56, 65, 73, 77, 87]",5

And I got a heads up from the clock

Don’t wanna just be talking bout it a lot
And not show no action
I know that I find satisfaction in rapping
On Instagram In the car snapping
To better my skill it was practice
Now I gotta show the world what’s hannin

And I got the evil going backwards
Naw I got em scared that I’m coming like the hash slinging slasher
Scared that I’m coming Fear Factor
It’s Cuz I deliver another message
Not  who I’m kissing loving who I’m sexing
Who I’m caressing  who I’m undressing
How I get down in the room when I’m naked
Don’t rap about the money that I’m making
Just know I’m making money conversations
Money rule the world
Word full of hatred
Lucifer ruling and y’all let em take it
Music is power start using your voice and
Get out of the booth making all of that noise
Sounding like Jsiejehebshenbebe
That’s something that I avoid
Don’t play with that boy
Cuz He gotta go gotta get it
And This what he do for a living
Dont play that boy

Dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do

[Verse 1]
I had him where I wanted him
He was saying he'd be mine
And none could take my place
And I laughed in his face

Well, I made some goofs
But this one tops them all
So I think I'll go bang
My head against the wall

Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...

[Verse 2]
I had him where I wanted him
He was giving me his heart
And begging me to stay
And I just walked away

Well, gee, now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...

[Bridge]
I couldn't see the
Forest through the trees
The boy I loved was
Down on his knees
And I played the game
And acted like a tease
Somebody kick me, please

[Chorus]
Cause I'm a dumb head (dumb head)
I'm a stupid little girl
Just a dumb head (dumb head)
Do do do do...

Now I'm convinced
That I must be insane
Or else I was born with
A peanut for a brain

You don't own me
You don't own me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 2: Grace]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

You don't own me
Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay

Don't tell me what to do
And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned

[Verse 5: Grace]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

71,Comin' In The Back Door,"[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Boy a fool, wonder what's cool
Tryin' to figure out what to rhyme about
I heard your mans ran cryin' to his mommy and his daddy
When the cops drove by his house, so who you tryin' to doubt
If you're lookin' for an answer, you're probably gonna find it now
And to the man in the hat standing lookin' at his watch
Motherfucker, well the time is now
Go clap your hands, let me hear you say, ""that's the jam""
See I wouldn't be shit if I ain't have no fans
Can't sit down kids you have to stand
Just put your hands up, you don't have to dance
Here, we get it poppin' like it's Pakistan
Iraq, Iran, and have them sayin' Mac's the man
The maximum, coming through to pass you bums
So if you ain't got no money better ask for some
Hey, we came to get down, have a good time
Bring the champagne out and the good wine
We gon' be sippin' and whippin' the sickest whips
Spittin' the illest shit that's sicker than syphilis
Comin' in the back door yellin' fuck a list
Fans takin' pictures while I'm tryin' to take a piss
We came to party, didn't come to give a shit
Now sing this part, it goes like this

H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Cause girl, you're baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I wanna hear y'all clap, just like that
Keep it goin' I'mma bring it all back
H-h-h-h-hold up
Every day they wanna ask me when I'll grow up
I show up cause fans will go nuts
Tell the girls it's cool, look but don't touch
I'll be home as soon as I can, I don't rush
Baby, baby, baby girl, you're good just don't fuss
I hear these couples fighting all the time, not us
We have a good time, like to get fucked up
What, what, goin' hard tonight
Under 21, but find me at the bar tonight
Hey, driving round in my car tonight
Making music that ain't hard to like, I got the heart to write
A couple bars I might go do
Something crazy or maybe lazy, love me or hate me
You know it's the same me
And it goes a little something like this

You laughed and you dared me to walk out the door
You said that I'd come back you knew what I'd do
And you know you were right cause I'm back here tonight begging to you

I won't disappoint you I'm begging to stay
That's what you wanted to hear anyway
It must make you happy to make me so blue
What a pityful sight I must be tonight begging to you

You don't want my loving but you let me stay around
I guess just to walk on so you won't touch the ground

But I'm gonna swing you 'round this floor; come dance with me

Look him straight in his eyes, put him wise and come on and dance with me
I'll sit and wait till you do; when you're through, come dance with me
Just 'cause he spent the dime to phone ya
And 20 bucks for the time he's shown ya
That doesn't give him the right to own ya; dance with me

I'm not the kind of guy who'd steal a fella's girl
But baby, your feet I need
And after taking just one look at you
I've turned into an ever-loving deed, aye!

You come into my arms, say goodbye to the guy and dance with me
Leave all your charms in my care, take your dare and dance with me
He may have brought you here, all right
Thinking he'd get to hold you tight
But you're gonna leave with me tonight, come dance with me

He may have brought you here, all right

My guns are bigger than a baby's arm
With Agent Orange like I was raised in ‘Nam
The bullets stay inside your brain like it's your favorite song
I don't give a fuck who they hitting, they can graze your mom
I load the motherfucking clip in, they like baby bombs
I see it as something beautiful when the metal fly
Around the way call me Lucifer, a hell of a guy
I'm a motherfucking veteran I'm telling you why
Beat his head until there's red in them I'm letting 'em die
City of brotherly thugs, the home of filthy living
You ain't fucking around with Vinnie, Percee, and Guilty Simpson
Unless you wanna be the target that we dump the clip in
I do the shit during the day, I like the gun to glisten
You a backwards motherfucker you run prison
You think that being locked with males in jail's a fun position
You should kill yourself rapper and be stuck in the earth
To be honest ain't no rapper that can fuck with you, Perc

For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept
In the waistline where the roscoe's kept

In the waistline where the roscoe's kept

Fast or slow pace my flow lace tracks this cat'll throw bass
And don't waste steps and go chase broads to no place
Master streets, impress the freaks, pimps dressed for weeks
Hoes left to me I guess to cheat and test the sheets
Ripping shows from here to Britain yo I'm hitting hoes
Skipping those women that sniffin' blow and not getting dough
First degree murder rhymes disturbing mind like urban lies
And quote words only science to Percee P
Amateurs know they can't stand with the pro
My Los Angeles flow cause damages most scandalous foes better handle it yo
I'm getting that food that are steady ripping blacks
Spitting raps, hitting cats for kicking wack lyrics to bitten tracks
My interviews say I said a few lines to diminish crews
Some men'll do shit like bending rules
Go for the kill I'll still finish you
I'm so hot we gotta close shop, you know not to open your spot
While I patrol blocks you getting no props

[Hook]
For the cats in the hood with a rep
Hustle through the AM when most men slept

[Verse 3: Guilty Simpson]
Guilty Simpson damage is beyond word descriptions
Rough verse inscriptions wrote by cutthroats
Smoke in the alley where the young cats bust toast
Pinching pennies to pay up his truck note
My various techniques compare with Jet Li
I'll chop with an AK and kick when it's pay day
Let's see how many men must test me
Deadly with a pen, let the rest beware
Face down in the playground six feet deep
In the sandbox when my right hand cocks back on the hammer
You rest in peace
I pray on wack cats when I bless the beats
Like priests in the Vatican heat rat-a-tattling
And sprayed up the vehicle your homeboy traveled in
Fuck the spots they brag about
We kick your front door way in and drag em out",Percee P,1963,"[77, 81, 82]",3

Let's get together and go for a walk in the park
And while we're walking we can steal a little kiss in the dark
I wanna walk with you
I wanna talk with you
But it's up you to say ""Come on baby""
If you don't hurry up I'll go crazy
'Cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun

What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one

[Verse 2]
I'm sure that you know that I love you with all of my heart
But a love that's true really takes two to start
I wanna do my share
To show you that I care
'Cause a one-sided love will never do
You gotta show me that you love me too
'Cause falling in love all alone is just no fun

[Chorus]
What two can easily do, what two can easily do
Is so hard to be done by one

[Verse 3]
One can build a love affair slowly
Two can build a love affair fast
One can make a love get started
Two can make it last

I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Outro]
Baby, when you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together",Mariah Carey,1963,"[82, 85, 88]",3
81,Letter From Sherry,"The superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.

A onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.

Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.

—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?

Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.

Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.

—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.

Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.

Father Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.

—Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?

A zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?

O, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.

Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.

Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.

—But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.

The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:

—O, sir.

—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.

Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.

Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.

Was that not Mrs M'Guinness?

Mrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?

A fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.

Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.

Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.

A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.

Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.

Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.

Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.

Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.

Father Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.

Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.

On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.

Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.

At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.

Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.

It was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.

Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.

Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.

At Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.

From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.

Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.

At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.

The Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.

Father Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.

A listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.

Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.

Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.

It was a charming day.

The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.

Father Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.

Nones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.

Father Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.

He walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.

A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.

Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.

Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.

Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.

Constable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.

—That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.

—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.

—It's very close, the constable said.

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.

—What's the best news? he asked.

—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:

—For England...

He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:

—home and beauty.

J. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.

A stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.

He halted and growled angrily:

—For England...

Two barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.

He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:

—home and beauty.

The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.

One of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:

—There, sir.

Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.

—Did you put in the books? Boody asked.

Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.

—They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.

Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.

—Where did you try? Boody asked.

—M'Guinness's.

Boody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.

—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.

Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.

—What's in the pot? she asked.

—Shirts, Maggy said.

Boody cried angrily:

—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?

Katey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:

—And what's in this?

A heavy fume gushed in answer.

—Peasoup, Maggy said.

—Where did you get it? Katey asked.

—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.

The lacquey rang his bell.

—Barang!

Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily:

—Give us it here.

Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:

—A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?

—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.

Boody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:

—Our father who art not in heaven.

Maggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:

—Boody! For shame!

A skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.

The blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.

—Put these in first, will you? he said.

—Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.

—That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.

She bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.

Blazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.

H. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.

He turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.

—Can you send them by tram? Now?

A darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.

—Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?

—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.

The blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.

—Will you write the address, sir?

Blazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.

—Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.

—Yes, sir. I will, sir.

Blazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.

—What's the damage? he asked.

The blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.

Blazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.

—This for me? he asked gallantly.

The blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.

—Yes, sir, she said.

Bending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.

Blazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.

—May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.

—Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.

He gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.

—Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia. É peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.

—Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.

—Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.

By the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.

—Ci rifletterò, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.

—Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.

His heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.

—Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.

—Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.

—Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!

Almidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.

Miss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.

Too much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.

The disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.

Miss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:

—16 June 1904.

Five tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.

Then she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.

The telephone rang rudely by her ear.

—Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.

She scribbled three figures on an envelope.

—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.

Two pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.

—Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?

—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.

—Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.

The vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.

—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.

—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?

—No, Ned.

—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.

—That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.

—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...

—Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.

In the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.

From a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.

—I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...

—You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?

—Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.

—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.

He followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.

He stood to read the card in his hand.

—The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.

The young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.

Ned Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.

—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:

—Woa, sonny!

He turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:

—Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.

With gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.

—Chow! he said. Blast you!

—The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.

—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...

He held his handkerchief ready for the coming...

—I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!

Tom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.

—See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.

He slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.

Lawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.

—See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?

He showed them the rising column of disks on the right.

—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.

—See? Tom Rochford said.

He slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.

—I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.

—Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.

—Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin

Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.

—But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.

—Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.

He followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.

—He's a hero, he said simply.

—I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.

—Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.

They passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.

Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.

—The act of a hero, he said.

At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.

—This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?

M'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.

—After three, he said. Who's riding her?

—O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.

While he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.

The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.

—Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.

They went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.

—There he is, Lenehan said.

—Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.

—Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.

—He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.

Lenehan laughed.

—I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.

They crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.

—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...

—I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.

—Did she? Lenehan said.

A card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.

He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.

—But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...

—I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...

Lenehan linked his arm warmly.

—But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.

He held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:

—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?

His hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.

—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.

Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.

—I'm weak, he gasped.

M'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.

—He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.

Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.

He laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.

—That I had, he said, pushing it by.

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.

—Them are two good ones, he said.

Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.

On O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.

Mr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.

He opened it. Thought so.

A woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.

No: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.

He read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.

He read where his finger opened.

—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!

Yes. This. Here. Try.

—Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabillé.

Yes. Take this. The end.

—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.

Mr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.

Warmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!

Young! Young!

An elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.

Mr Bloom beheld it.

Mastering his troubled breath, he said:

—I'll take this one.

The shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.

—Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.

The lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.

Dilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.

The lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:

—Barang!

Bang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.

Mr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.

—It's time for you, she said.

—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!

Dilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.

—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?

He let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.

—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.

Mr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.

—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.

—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.

—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.

—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.

Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.

—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?

—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.

He handed her a shilling.

—See if you can do anything with that, he said.

—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.

—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.

He left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.

—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.

The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.

—Barang!

—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.

The lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:

—Bang!

Mr Dedalus stared at him.

—Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.

—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.

—I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.

He drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.

—Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.

Mr Dedalus thought and nodded.

—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.

—You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.

—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.

He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.

The viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.

—I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.

The lacquey banged loudly.

Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:

—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!

From the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.

I smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact.

Graft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.

Saw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

Mr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.

Aham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.

North wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.

Mr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.

Aham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.

Down there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.

Bad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.

Let me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.

Mr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.

Denis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.

Mr Kernan approached Island street.

Times of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.

Damn good gin that was.

Fine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.

At the siege of Ross did my father fall.

A cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.

Mr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.

His Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!

Stephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.

Born all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.

She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.

Old Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.

And you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.

Two old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.

The whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.

Yes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.

Stephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.

He turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.

—Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.

Tattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Curé of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.

I might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.

Father Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.

Binding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:

—Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.

Who wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.

—What are you doing here, Stephen?

Dilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.

Shut the book quick. Don't let see.

—What are you doing? Stephen said.

A Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum.

—What have you there? Stephen asked.

—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?

My eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.

He took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.

—What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?

She nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.

Show no surprise. Quite natural.

—Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.

—Some, Dilly said. We had to.

She is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.

We.

Agenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.

Misery! Misery!

—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?

—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.

They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.

—What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.

—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.

—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?

—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.

—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.

—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.

He looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.

—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!

He put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.

—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.

Ben Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.

As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:

—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.

—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.

Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:

—That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?

—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.

He stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:

—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.

—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.

—And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.

Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.

Ben Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.

—Aw! he said.

—That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.

—What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?

He turned to both.

—That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.

The reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.

Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.

—Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.

—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.

Ben Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.

—What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?

—He has, Father Cowley said.

—Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?

—That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?

—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.

He led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.

—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.

—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.

The policeman touched his forehead.

—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.

He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.

Bronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.

—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.

—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.

—Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.

John Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.

On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.

The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.

—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.

—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.

—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.

—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.

John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.

—I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

They went down Parliament street.

—There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.

—Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.

Outside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.

John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.

—The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.

They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.

—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.

The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.

—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.

Long John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.

—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.

Hell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.

Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.

Martin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.

—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.

Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.

—O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!

Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.

—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.

With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.

—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.

—Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.

Long John Fanning could not remember him.

Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.

—What's that? Martin Cunningham said.

All turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.

—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.

—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.

As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:

—Parnell's brother. There in the corner.

They chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.

—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.

—Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.

John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.

—I'll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress.

—Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.

When she had gone he said, laughing:

—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.

Haines opened his newbought book.

—I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.

The onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:

—England expects...

Buck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.

—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.

—I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.

Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.

—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...

—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.

Buck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.

—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?

He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.

—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.

—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.

He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.

—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.

Elijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.

Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.

Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.

At the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:

—Coactus volui.

He strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.

As he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.

—God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!

Opposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.

After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.

Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.

In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.

No Sandymount tram.

Master Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.

His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.

Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.

William Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.

Blazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cortège:

But though she's a factory lass
And wears no fancy clothes.
Baraabum.
Yet I've a sort of a
Yorkshire relish for
My little Yorkshire rose.
Baraabum.

Thither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.",James Joyce,1963,[83],1

83,In The Summer Of His Years,"A young man rode with his head held high
Under the Texas sun
And no one guessed that a man so blessed
Would perish by the gun
Lord, would perish by the gun

A shot rang out like a sudden shout
And Heaven held its breath
For the dreams of a multitude of man
Rode with him to his death
Lord, rode with him to his death

Yes, the heart of the world weighs heavy
With the helplessness of tears
For the man cut down in a Texas town
In the summer of his years
The summer of his years

And we who stay mustn't ever lose
The victories that he won
For wherever man look to freedom
His soul goes riding on
Lord, his soul goes riding on",Connie Francis,1963,[85],1

You did, you did - Oh no, it wasn't me at all

I asked her out, she laughed & said ""No way""
Told me she would never date such a geek
For that remark I say she's gonna pay
I hate when people call me a freak!

She's kissing with the football star
Late at night in his car
Driven by an unknown force
Feeling hate and no remorse

Who killed the cheerleader?

I asked her for a dance, she yelled ""Drop dead""

Now I hade it, with that blonde little pet
With everybody else but me she flirts

Hiding in the locker room
Watching when her hair she groom
Driven by an unkown force
Feeling no remorse

I find peace and comfort and care

Would lend a helping hand they'd sooner to see me crawl

Now just when life itself seems more than I can bare, your there
And in the shelter of your arms
I find strength and safety in them
I rise and start again

Just give me one good reason
To go on living
To keep on trying
For what
I ask you for what
If not for you and all your love
To see me through

When times look bad
The shelter of your arms will keep away each fear
And this cold world
Can never get me down
As long as you are here

That's why I pray to god

And I will know the shelter of your arms
And your love for all of my life

90,Did You Have A Happy Birthday?,"[Verse 1: Jake Sweeney]
Hold a Glock to her pussy, a wussy no longer
This feeling will not subside, it only grows stronger
Screaming it's coming, what the fuck is going on?
It all makes sense now, where did I go wrong?
The placenta falls out with a spray of afterbirth
I lose focus, I lose my mind, I lose my obtained girth
Sweating bullets as I come to my senses and see what has become
The gun is gone, the girth is faded, the minorities have won
A baby, new to the world, but somehow already tainted
Is this what it feels like, to have finally procreated?
A feeling of familiarity but it doesn't make sense, it cannot be
That smiling baby has the Glock, pointed directly at me
(laughing baby sound effect)
(gunshot)
Brain blast like jimmy neutron but is this how it ends?
I can think and can feel, but I cannot comprehend
All I can think of is missing my beautiful bae
Hope she will remember me, happy birthday...

98,Where Or When,"It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But i can't remember where or when
The clothes you're wearing and the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But i can't remember where or when
Some things that happen for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before
And loved before
But baby who knows where or when

(It's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all)
(Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall)
(It's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all)
(Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall)

[Verse 1]
Your best friend asked if I am straight or gay
I can understand the question when I dance this way
Straight I said, he said that's okay
Some other little something might be coming your way
A little while later and up you slide
Sipping on your drink, I'm making moves on the side
I've got to impress her with my mating routine
Show her something no New Yorker will have ever seen
So I pull out the peacock knees of surprise
She laughs and tells me that I sprayed sweat in her eyes
I apologise, stand still on the spot
She puts her hand on my back and says wow you're hot

[Hook]
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on

[Verse 2]
It's as clear as the ice melting in my glass
There was no need for questions to be asked
Hear the how d'you dos, why d'you dos, political views, you've heard the news
The, ""Oh, my God it's different here, you have to tip with every beer""
It's clear, so little time to waste
Make the move, haste post haste
This is lust at first sight
Let's knock at the night 'til it retreats to light

[Verse 3]
I'm in New York making out in the back of a cab
And she's giving me her body to taste, touch and grab
I'm fulfilling a cliche, ticking a box
Big Apple, yellow cab and an American fox
The city gliding past us block by block
I never ever ever want this cliché to stop

[Verse 4]
Knowing that skyscrapers rise above
I could have sworn I felt a crazy little surge of love
The love of lust, directed at you
Do you feel the same way too
Please tell me that you do
And we can love lust the whole night through

[Chorus]
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall
They say it's better to have loved and lost than never loved at all
Just love the lust, you'll have the leap without the fall

100,Hey Little Girl,"[Verse 1]
I'm all choked up
I cannot talk
I gotta fucked up brain
Fucked up thoughts
I thought I was ok
But then I guess not
Hope you know that this is your fault
I want you to feel bad when you go to sleep
I hope you're sad when you remember me
And feel bad for all you did to me
I hope you lie there in your misery

Fighting for all that I've lost
It's my time to show who's boss

You make me bleed when you don't get your way
I hope you're scared when you remember me
I hope you lie there in your misery

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

[Verse 2]
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

[Chorus]
Smoke on the water
(And fire in the sky)
Smoke on the water

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know I know we'll never forget

And it's making me feel so sad

And got out just for spite

107,Yesterday And You (Armen's Theme),"I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.
      ""And where the deuce ha' you been?"" was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
      I said I had been down to hear the Carols. ""Ah! well!"" observed Mrs. Joe. ""You might ha' done worse."" Not a doubt of that I thought.
      ""Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and (what's the same thing) a slave with her apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,"" said Mrs. Joe. ""I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best of reasons for my never hearing any.""
      Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.
      We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; ""for I ain't,"" said Mrs. Joe,—""I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!""
      So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.
      My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else. Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me, I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
      Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said, ""Ye are now to declare it!"" would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
      Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle, but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.
      The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he himself confessed that if the Church was ""thrown open,"" meaning to competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church not being ""thrown open,"" he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say, ""You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!""
      I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. I was not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.
      ""Mrs. Joe,"" said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to, ""I have brought you as the compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.""
      Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells. Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, ""O, Un—cle Pum-ble—chook! This is kind!"" Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he now retorted, ""It's no more than your merits. And now are you all bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence?"" meaning me.
      We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Joe's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married Mr. Hubble,—I don't know at what remote period,—when she was much younger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.
      Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak (I didn't want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone. But they wouldn't leave me alone. They seemed to think the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
      It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful. Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low reproachful voice, ""Do you hear that? Be grateful.""
      ""Especially,"" said Mr. Pumblechook, ""be grateful, boy, to them which brought you up by hand.""
      Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, ""Why is it that the young are never grateful?"" This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, ""Naterally wicious."" Everybody then murmured ""True!"" and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner.
      Joe's station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint.
      A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being ""thrown open""—what kind of sermon he would have given them. After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he remarked that he considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many subjects ""going about.""
      ""True again,"" said Uncle Pumblechook. ""You've hit it, sir! Plenty of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails. That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if he's ready with his salt-box."" Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, ""Look at Pork alone. There's a subject! If you want a subject, look at Pork!""
      ""True, sir. Many a moral for the young,"" returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; ""might be deduced from that text.""
      (""You listen to this,"" said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)
      Joe gave me some more gravy.
      ""Swine,"" pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—""swine were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an example to the young."" (I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.) ""What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.""
      ""Or girl,"" suggested Mr. Hubble.
      ""Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,"" assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably, ""but there is no girl present.""
      ""Besides,"" said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, ""think what you've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker—""
      ""He was, if ever a child was,"" said my sister, most emphatically.
      Joe gave me some more gravy.
      ""Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,"" said Mr. Pumblechook. ""If you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—""
      ""Unless in that form,"" said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.
      ""But I don't mean in that form, sir,"" returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted; ""I mean, enjoying himself with his elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he wouldn't. And what would have been your destination?"" turning on me again. ""You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would have shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then. Not a bit of it!""
      Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.
      ""He was a world of trouble to you, ma'am,"" said Mrs. Hubble, commiserating my sister.
      ""Trouble?"" echoed my sister; ""trouble?"" and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there.
      I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with indignation and abhorrence.
      ""Yet,"" said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, ""Pork—regarded as biled—is rich, too; ain't it?""
      ""Have a little brandy, uncle,"" said my sister.
      O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
      My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man trifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
      I couldn't keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of his mind.
      I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn't know how I had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him, sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, ""Tar!""
      I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.
      ""Tar!"" cried my sister, in amazement. ""Why, how ever could Tar come there?""
      But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't hear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude.
      By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding. The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, ""Clean plates,—cold.""
      I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.
      ""You must taste,"" said my sister, addressing the guests with her best grace—""you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook's!""
      Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!
      ""You must know,"" said my sister, rising, ""it's a pie; a savory pork pie.""
      The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously, all things considered,—""Well, Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie.""
      My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry. I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that ""a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,"" and I heard Joe say, ""You shall have some, Pip."" I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.
      But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, ""Here you are, look sharp, come on!""",Charles Dickens,1963,"[60, 55, 59, 59, 62, 74, 84]",7

109,Gotta Lotta Love,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Woke up the other mornin, I heard a rumor
They said the gang wars was over
I told em they was bullshittin, they said it's real as hell
Can't explain the way I felt
Too many years I seen my brothers die
And I can't say that shit was really that fly
But I used to gangbang when I was younger
So it's really hard to tell a kid that he's goin under
I never thought I lived to see us chill
Crips and Bloods holdin hands, the shit is ill
But I love it, I can't help it
Too much death on the streets, and we dealt it
Van Ness Boys, The Hoovers, The 60s
Bounty Hunters, 8-Treys, all coolin out, gee
I pray the shit'll never stop
You used to see the wrong colors, and the gats went pop-pop
But now the kids got a chance to live
And the O.G.'s got something to give
That's love, black on black, that's how they made it
And if any busters flip, they get faded
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 2 ]
I got a lotta love, cause you're all my brothers
Red or blue, black's the color
We got a chance, so we can really sweat the real fools
Show those muthafuckas the real tools
Check the enemy, it ain't the family
Not 1-11, try L.A.P.D
They gotta understand, they beat on a blackman
There's gonna be drama, know what I'm sayin?
And if we flip, let's all flip together
Cause I'm prepared, kid, for rough weather
And we gotta realize, the boys on the east side
You call em Eses, I call em allies
Because the day that we all unite
Watch the pigs get real polite
Punk muthafuckas gotta learn quick
That we ain't takin no more shit
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 3 ]
Crenshaw Boulevard, Sunday afternoon
Folks sittin on things, mad systems boom
The girls are lookin better
The gang truce is on, so you wear whatever
At Venice by the ocean
Rag-top Trey hits the three-wheel motion
There's gangsters all around
Still crazy sets, but you just don't clown
I pray L.A. can stay this way
It's the first summer I can really say
I felt cool, we all chilled
Went to the park, and nobody got killed
Now if you got a problem, it's man on man
You don't need a gang to solve em
I seen the greatest thing I seen in my life
Two brothers in a straight up fist fight
Nobody pulled a gat, nobody jumped in
Nobody pulled a knife, nobody got done in
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to my city, cause I got a lotta love

[ VERSE 4 ]
G-a-t-e-s, I hope you wear a vest
Even after you're out the fuckin office
Cause we're on a totally different tip
Fuck that pig brutality shit
This unity is gettin to me
Every brother on the street is my homie
I'm rollin through a hood that I never been
And every brother steps to me as a friend
I love it, I love it
And nothin in my life will ever be above it
We wanna see our kids all grown up
We're tired of seein our hoods get blown up
L.A. is a great place
Fly girls, dope cars, life at a fast pace
But gangbanging was killin it quick
Another child got hit - bullshit
Pop-pop-pop, 10 on a weekend
We was goin off to deep end
But now we got a chance, my friend
To mend, and make the colors blend
Let's all go out on a picnic, kick shit
And squash all the static
Last year I lost about five homies
This shit is real to me
L.A. is where I'm speakin of
Peace to all the gangsters, cause I got a lotta love

If I'll see you again?

So thank you and goodnight

Can you see what we've done?
I can die having loved
So thank you and goodnight
I wish I could stay by your side
But we leave one by one
It's the same way that we come

So thank you and goodnight
I couldn't want more from my life
I'm no longer scared
I'm just so glad you were there

Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight

When you said goodbye
That it was the last time
That it was the last time

112,Why Do Kids Grow Up,"Kids your age would play on the playground
Eating sunshine and candy til they were full
But you stayed at home preparing for the SAT's
And your parents dressed you in business casual

And your friends they like those purple fizzy drinks
But coffee was your kind of brew
On the grass they would yell, ""red rover come on over""
But watching the Dow jump seemed more fun to you
And your parents they say what's happening?
Why do these kids grow up so fast?
Is it the MTV? Yes, dear, it's gotta be

And when we fuck it's the truth, It's no lie
Have you busting bigger then bigger than four five
Love a uphill and this is a cold climb

Cause you know me better than most of these hoes

By a real one, and she got that

So she moved on
I moved up
Like she too gone
I'm too drunk

Like no pain, no gain
Probably going over head like Rogaine
But, how the hell am I to make my wealth

Got a shot in the dark, no target

Wonder why I hang around all that stuff
Gave them all out now I'm down to my last, fuck
And the time it takes, for my incline
I might break, why? It's my design
Because the more I grow
I feel the less I know
I'm trying to figure out a way to blow the stress I show
Because I don't want to be the animal scared of the world
Too immature to ever care for a girl

Got to get away, she owned me there
Same chicks with the same old problems
Can't solve them, I don't need that
Do better for myself and my family
They support, but they don't understand me
Like sure, bittersweet like candy
Know I'm going through them all and the fans see
Head low and the shit celebrate
Standing in the mirror, and I sure feel weight
Got the world on my shoulder
Started as a chip, but it turned into boulder

You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

136,Cry To Me,"(Intro)
Sometimes it's so hard to be happy.
When all you do is hold on to your insecurities.
The hurting heart is the most painful.
So let it all out then, oh cry.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Verse 1)
When will you emerge from your hideaway?
From natural feelings that you won't escape.
Maybe it's my mind drifting too far into space.
And fly away to a better place.
But there's no other spot I'd rather lay.
So don't be scared, no, I won't hurt you (so cry).

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

(Bridge)
We're better together in any weather.
If you're cold I'm your sweater.
If it rains I'm your umbrella.
No is one perfect, but to me you're perfection.
What are flaws besides they're creation?
You're gunna walk through the heartaches, walk through the pain.
Don't feel alone in the shadow.
You're not the one to blame.
So if I could just ease your mind to see what you should be or to look and to watch and what to believe is real.
Let it all go, it will make you feel better.
So drop it all and cry to me if you want to.

(Chorus)
Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
It's fine, fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside.
Hard to leave, so cry, cry to me.

Cry, cry to me, if you wanna.
Fine, it's fine by me.
Cause I'll always be inside (inside).

On the Rorschach sheets where we make love
Honeybear, Honeybear, Honeybear
Fuck the world, damn straight malaise
It may be just us who feel this way
But don't ever doubt this, my steadfast conviction
My love, you're the one I wanna watch the ship go down with
The future can't be real, I barely know how long a moment is
Unless we're naked, getting high on the mattress
While the global market crashes
As death fills the streets we're garden-variety oblivious
You grab my hand and say in ""I-told-you-so"" voice:
""It’s just how we expected""

Everything is doomed
And nothing will be spared
But I love you, honeybear
Honeybear, honeybear, honeybear

[Verse 2]
You're bent over the altar and the neighbors are complaining
That the misanthropes next door are probably conceiving a Damien
Don't they see the darkness rising? Good luck fingering oblivion
We're getting out now while we can
You're welcome, boys, have the last of the smokes and chicken
Just one Cadillac will do to get us out to where we're going
I've brought my mother's depression
You've got your father's scorn and a wayward aunt's schizophrenia

[Chorus 2]
But everything is fine
Don't give into despair

My heart says ""Yes, indeed"" in me

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

She had a pair of roving eyes

I remember the nights we dated
Always acting sophisticated
Talking about high society
Then she tried to make a fool out of me

They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Broke my heart now
Thinks she's smart now
We're apart now

Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around and breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the 5 & 10 cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's the girl next door

They call her Donna, Donna the Prima Donna
Broke my heart
Thinks she's smart
We're apart

Pretty little girl you're just having fun
You're running all around, you're breaking lover's hearts
Pretty little girl, I don't stand a chance
Without any money there goes our romance

She always wears charms, diamonds, pearls galore
She buys them at the 5 & 10 cents store
She wants to be just like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Even though she's Donna next door

152,Cross Fire!,"[Verse 1]
He'd trade his guns for love
But he's caught in the crossfire
And he keeps wakin' up
But it's not to the sound of birds
The tyranny, the violent streets
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
And we can't get enough, no

[Chorus]
Heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfi-, that's caught in the crossfire

[Verse 2]
I'd trade my luck to know
Why he's caught in the crossfire
And I'm here wakin' up
To the sun and the sound of birds
Society's anxiety
Deprived of all that we're blessed with
We just can't get enough, no

[Chorus]
Heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother, every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfi-, that's caught in the crossfire

[Bridge]
Can I trust what I'm given?
When faith still needs a gun
Whose ammunition justifies the wrong?
And I can't see from the backseat
So I'm askin' from above
Can I trust what I'm given, even when it cuts?

[Chorus]
So heaven, if you sent us down
So we can build a playground
For the sinners to play as saints
You'd be so proud of what we've made
I hope you got some beds around
'Cause you're the only refuge now
For every mother and every child, every brother
That's caught in the crossfire
That's caught in the crossfire

153,A Fine Fine Boy,"My boy
I got so much love in my heart for him
That I really don't feel like me when he's not around
Yes, there are boys and there are boys
But he's a fine, fine boy

I wanna tell the world about the boy I love
Just the kind of guy I was dreaming of
He's so sincere when he holds me tight
And when I'm blue he makes me feel alright

And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And he's fine, fine, fine
I know he's fine, fine, fine

But love is more important than a diamond ring
So all I wanna do is stay by his side
And take care of him and I'll be satisfied

Oh he's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart
And something tells me that we'll never part
He's got a sweet, sweet, kiss and a true, true heart

And you drove your mother's car to pick me up at 8:15
But I was always running late
And this was just like any other day

When you caught my eye, you were just 23
But you left me cold and crying for the girl of your teenage dreams
All is fair in love and war
My broken heart possessed your love no more

You get high
While everyone around you is getting low
You get high
While everyone around you is getting low

I was walking empty streets in the town where we were made
With my heart still incomplete and I knew you felt the same
I was still just running scared
Every door I opened led to nowhere

You get high
While everyone around you is getting low
You get high
While everyone around you is getting low

And Steven Street was ours but you kept me far away
When I could not entertain you would show your other face
Suffering was all you did
When the morning light came streaming in

You get high
While everyone around you is getting low
You get high
While everyone around you is getting low

Everyone around you is getting low

You dream what you dream

Play me serenade
A simple masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

Was he real or make-believe
Or someone to deceive
That time is just a folly we can't see
You only know one song
Play it right or play it wrong
'Cause the truth is always somewhere in between

You and I - we can't change the weather
And we're all in this together so let the stong wind blow
Oh now things will be much better
If you don't become a prisoner to the reason you should know

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me a serenade
A lover's masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

[Verse]
In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, oh, the things I'd do
To spend a little time in Hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself

[Bridge]
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies are drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

172,Stop Monkeyin' Aroun',"[Verse 1]
She call me Easy but nothing came easy for me
They see my face in the city and say what up to me and say that I’m easy to see
They draw my face and they send it to me
Used to be mean now she friendly to me
2013 and my messages dry, we back in the dorm and everyone tellin’ me ‘you should probly’ put this shit to the side’
Ey, ey
I was a different guy (I was a different guy)
Practisin’ I knew that I would be somethin’ but no one would listen why (no one would listen why)
Actin’ like I’ll be a star but I was just more than a little shy (more than a little shy)
Jump on the bus and if I wasn’t writing man I would just visualize

[Chorus] x2
Life was simple, life was simple but life was not as fun
I got options, I got options, I remember I had none
Used to crush on her, now she really crush on me
Just know I paid the price and nothin’ ever came for free

[Verse 2]
I made a sacrifice
My grandma she disagree with my decisions but why would I listen to someone who hardly even had a life
Mhm
I knew how she grew up so I know it’s bad advice
I know I’m a screw but fuck it, I have to fight
Too tapped in to tap out
I know my skin brown but I black out boy
I’m too five and shout out to Top 5 but he still won’t get me to get a stack out boy
Boy better know
Your boy get better with time and it shows
I climbed from a featherweight
Man like a heavyweight pro
Man-Man like me he gon’ blow
Boom, pow
Yeah I kid around but I ain’t no child
They’ll probly do you dirty like it ain’t no foul
Stay tip top mayne in a flip flop game where they do thangs if it look better on the Dow
(God) God knows they’ve thrown everything at-at me but the towel
It’s clapback season and I hardly need me a reason to snap back at em’ right now
They don’t wanna’ promote you
Rather have you workin’ at a Walmart prayin’ that your manager promote you
I know that I’d be naive if I thought it’s all off of your code and ya virtues
They wanna
Yell ‘slime’ but they really all snakes
Wanna
Say ‘love your drive’ but they wanna put the brakes on ya
This is not a playground to me, stop monkeyin’ around before I go ape on ya
Apeshit, break shit
Comin’ from the basement
I give a lot, never take shit
I don’t got a hit but every song sound like one and my studio’s makeshift
I smoke until I see spaceships
I drink until I feel weightless
Wasted but I got one life, one shot, one go and I know I can’t waste it

[Chorus] x2
Life was simple, life was simple but life was not as fun
I got options, I got options, I remember I had none
Used to crush on her, now she really crush on me
Just know I paid the price and nothin’ ever came for free

Swift wings you must borrow
Make straight for the shore
We marry tomorrow

Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye

And when the fields are soft and green

""Look, have any of you heard of The Army of the 12 Monkeys?
They, they paint this
They, stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere
Have you seen this?""
""Mr. Cole?""
""Have you seen this?""
""Why don't you just take your time
And try to explain’ this whole thing from the beginning.""

[Verse 1: GMS]
I'm tired of hearin’ about your theoretical skills
Like underground was a miracle pill, like you lyrically ill
You could get offered a deal for three quarters a mill
And still suck like you underwater, breathin’ through gills
You enter every battle tryna get a few kills
Get a few thrills and can't write a song that'll sell a few mills
You could join Cypress Hill and never “B-Real.”  Better to chill
The Plague spreadin' will increase your medical bills
You worthless (hey).  We above the clouds and beneath the surface
Any state, city, borough, town where CD's get purchased
Even if we re-word this, these words'll leave you nervous
Don’t ask, don’t tell, faggot, or you’ll be asked to leave the service

[Verse 2: Pumpkinhead]
It's The Plague man, beatin’ us is dead like a graveyard
Don't get your head chopped off like ""Braveheart""
The 12 Monkey Army, move like a bunch of zombies on Harleys
We the Angels of apocalypse, not Charlie's
I'm the type to beat down a car thief
With my son's car seat, and stop his heartbeat (b-boom, b-boom)
Y'all don't want beef—y'all all weak.  We twelve deep
Night of the creeps, we patrol your streets
Don't make me blam your team up—you ain't tough!
You a Warrior Princess like Xena with C-cups
R&B diva on this beat—I bat clean up
And got black kids jumpin’ like the cast of ""Sarafina!""
12 Monkeys is the clique, biohazard's the symbol
Y'all fools ain't nimble, your rhymes is simple
Don't Erick Sermon your career, it's flyin’ out the window
How many ways to end you, offend you?
Quadruple, six million, reptilian
Cold-blooded chameleons hangin’ from the ceilin’
I paralyze myself, just to kill you with no feelin’
Eel skin scaly, move like Hailey's Comet
Through the projects, flying objects
In a cockpit with Davy Crockett rockets
Cock and bust it, double-barrel musket
That could cut down a grizzly to the size of a Teddy Ruxpin

[Verse 3: LR Blitzkrieg]
Uhh, Blitz, yo
Lightin’ in, I strike in the wind, I strike and I win
A mic and some Henn' and I'll strike on a whim
Ya hype man hyper’ than you and I'm hyper’ than him
Brooklyn belongs to us, I got a right to defend
I'm terrific with the freestyle in spite of the pen
You hear it freestyled, go home, and write it again
That's when I go right past the writin’ and go right to your chin
Nose, eyes, swell up, develop, bruising and tightening skin
You might be a Mighty Mouse but fightin’ mightier men
We ride in custom choppers with twins, you bikin’ on Schwinns
We got custom twin choppers that could chop off your limbs
This the beginnin’ for us, for you a frightenin’ end
Plizzle!

[Verse 4: Kameel-Yen]
If the beat's perfection, I'm speech injectin’
With inflection to make men reach erection
We're detecting all wannabes, haters, and yes-men
Spread quick, dead shit, kill 'em off from infection
It's not just an expression sayin’ we're Lethal Weapons
Plus there’s still Pack, Tone, Stan, Seed, and Session
Give your man drugs, get cops to arrest him
With Gang green boys in blue is your only protection, c'mon

[Verse 5: Wild Child]
Watch out now!
It's so tragic how I add another cadaver quick
You’d think I'm on some magic abracadabra shit
Half of you scatter, half of you rappers attract to it
Like mag-a-nets.  Don’t have the strength to smash my elaborate lab
Within my labyrinth—The Plague!
Collaborative narratives assassinate you characters
Even the baddest kids disparage when I carry 'em
Like Passion of Nazareth, it's so embarrassin’
So amateur, low caliber, no stamina
Too often awful off and on camera
Before my primates get irate
You better peel ‘cause we hungry like seven plus five apes

Let me rip into a slow jam

[Verse One] [Mondo]
I wasn't always cool
I used to freestyle on my BMX bicycle
And just like any brother Michael Jackson was my hero
Bet the boogie got you bangin'
Oh you was the one to diss?
Well now your grand pops be slangin'
Honeydips in the Walkman, walkin' feelin' fine
Three dreadlocks, baggy slacks, the whole nine
It's the unconditional, type of slang we must display
Bouncin' off ?
Until your stomach come to me
While freeze tag was in session
I was on the mic
While your brother wore his doo rag
I was on the mic
If there was a show goin' on at night
I was on the mic
Whenever Jane call my name
I wasn't on the mic
But I was damn near close
And spiritually you felt me
You should have felt the vibe and yo the way the joint held me
Was the bomb, now I'm cheesin', I'm pleasin' the crowd
Piecin' up my puzzle got my horse in the muzzle
Taste the honey now you bounce with it
You're reduced to sweat
Your ears are locked tight I might explode from the threat
Boogiemonsters in your area
Or Mondo in your dome
Your sister bought the single now there's Boogie in your home

Oblivious to time

I move it in the cycle of the universe astound
Get the pound and pull a little for the brothers off the path
Keep on studying the spirit and smilin' through the wrath
We gotta send a shout to our peeps across the land
Chewin' Salt Water Taffy, snappin' with the dance
Say, ""Ohhla ohhla ohhla""

Comin' through you like water
In my physical form, I ought ta
Tie my Tims and grip my nuts but then it'll be a slaughter
You can't front on the Salt Water Taffy
Kick you to your dentures
It's the adventures of the Daffy
In this ocean modulation I have the big lips
Chocolate simulation that stimulates your hips
Avoid the pit falls
Enjoy all that life has to offer
And realize the only piece of mind is in the water

There's a natural mist floatin' through the air

I give you that ole' uptown funk (AYO!) in the mix

On that, a one two, a one two like Biz Mark

Slippin' down to 33 cause maybe it be soundin' live
And speakers turn to dust
I'm leavin' sets in ashes
When I hear the dusty record will the static in the gashes
I am what I am cause I can't be nothin' else
I be Coolin with my J though I guess I +Rock The Bells+
My psychedelic chat call me Saul
If you want butter never front and I still be comin' off

And he asked me if I wanted to dance
He looked kind of nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When he danced he held me tight
And when he walked me home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then he kissed me

Each time I saw him
I couldn't wait to see him again
I wanted to let him know
That he was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
So I whispered ""I love you""
And he said that he loved me too
And then he kissed me

He kissed me in a way that I've never been kissed before
In a way that I want to be kissed forever more

I knew that he was mine
So I gave him all the love that I had
And one day he took me home
To meet his Mom and his Dad
Then he asked me to be his bride
And always be right by his side
Felt so happy I almost cried
And then he kissed me

198,(Theme From) Any Number Can Win,"Mr. Jason Robbins
Chief Executive Officer
DraftKings, Inc.
376 Boylston Street, Ste 501
Boston, MA 02116-3825

Dear Mr. Robins:

This letter constitutes a demand that DraftKings, Inc (“DraftKings”) cease and desist from illegally accepting wagers in New York State in connection with “Daily Fantasy Sports.”

As you know, on October 6, 2015, the Office of the New York State Attorney General (“NYAG”) commenced an investigation of DraftKings. Although this inquiry initially centered on allegations of employee misconduct and unfair use of proprietary information, DraftKings’ operations and business model – known colloquially as Daily Fantasy Sports (“DFS”) – necessarily came under review.

Our review concludes that DraftKings’ operations constitute illegal gambling under New York law, according to which, “a person engages in gambling when he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence.” DraftKings’ customers are clearly placing bets on events outside of their control or influence, specifically on the real-game performance of professional athletes. Further, each DraftKings wager represents a wager on a “contest of chance” where winning or losing depends on numerous elements of chance to a “material degree.”

DraftKings DFS contests are neither harmless nor victimless. Daily Fantasy Sports are creating the same public health and economic concerns as other forms of gambling, including addiction. Finally, DraftKings’ advertisements seriously mislead New York citizens about their prospects of winning.

We believe there is a critical distinction between DFS and traditional fantasy sports, which, since their rise to popularity in the 1980s, have been enjoyed and legally played by millions of New York residents. Typically, participants in traditional fantasy sports conduct a competitive draft, compete over the course of a long season, and repeatedly adjust their teams. They play for bragging rights or side wagers, and the Internet sites that host traditional fantasy sports receive most of their revenue from administrative fees and advertising, rather than profiting principally from gambling. For those reasons among others, the legality of traditional fantasy sports has never been seriously questioned in New York.

Unlike traditional fantasy sports, the sites hosting DFS are in active and full control of the wagering: DraftKings and similar sites set the prizes, control relevant variables (such as athlete “salaries”), and profit directly from the wagering. DraftKings has clear knowledge and ongoing active supervision of the DFS wagering it offers. Moreover, unlike traditional fantasy sports, DFS is designed for instant gratification, stressing easy game play and no long-term strategy. For these and other reasons, DFS functions in significantly different ways from sites that host traditional fantasy sports.

Further, DraftKings has promoted, and continues to promote DFS like a lottery, representing the game to New Yorkers as a path to easy riches that anyone can win. The DraftKings ads promise: “It’s the simplest way of winning life-changing piles of cash”; “The giant check is no myth. . . BECOME A MILLIONAIRE!” and similar enticements. Like most gambling operations, DraftKings’ own numbers reveal a far different reality. In practice, DFS is far closer to poker in this respect: a small number of professional gamblers profit at the expense of casual players. To date, our investigation has shown that the top one percent of DraftKings’ winners receive the vast majority of the winnings.

Finally, during the course of our investigation, the New York Attorney General has been deeply concerned to learn from health and gambling experts that DFS appears to be creating the same public health and economic problems associated with gambling, particularly for populations prone to gambling addiction and individuals who are unprepared to sustain losses, lured by the promise of easy money. Certain structural aspects of DFS make it especially dangerous, including the quick rate of play, the large jackpots, and the false perception that it is eminently winnable. Ultimately, it is these types of harms that our Constitution and gambling laws were intended to prevent in New York.

The illegality of DFS is clear from any reasonable interpretation of our laws, beginning with the New York State Constitution. The Constitution prohibits gambling in all forms not
specifically authorized:
[E]xcept as hereinafter provided, no lottery or the sale of lottery tickets, poolselling, book-making, or any other kind of gambling, except lotteries operated by the state . . ., except pari-mutuel betting on horse races . . . , and except casino gambling at no more than seven facilities. . . shall hereafter be authorized or allowed within this state; and the legislature shall pass appropriate laws to prevent offenses against any of the provisions of this section.
N.Y. Const. Art. I, § 9 (emphasis added).To enforce this clause, the Legislature established a series of criminal offenses applying to businesses that promote gambling. See, generally, N.Y. Penal Law §§ 225.00-225.40. These provisions all apply the same statutory definition of gambling:
A person engages in gambling when he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.N.Y. Penal Law § 225.00(2). The penal law imposes no criminal liability on individual bettors, focusing instead on bookmakers and other operations that advance or profit from illegal gambling activity. See, e.g., N.Y. Penal Law § 225.10 (Promoting Gambling in the first degree).

DraftKings wagers easily meet the definition of gambling. DraftKings bettors make bets (styled as “fees”) that necessarily depend on the real-world performance of athletes and on numerous elements of chance. The winning bettors receive large cash prizes – and the company takes a “rake” or a cut of from each wager.1

Accordingly, we demand that DraftKings cease and desist from illegally accepting wagers in New York State as part of its DFS contests.

This letter also serves as formal pre-litigation notice pursuant to New York State General Business Law (“GBL”) §§ 349 and 350 and Executive Law § 63(12). These statutes direct the State to give notice prior to commencing a summary proceeding to enjoin repeated illegal and deceptive acts and practices, and to obtain additional injunctive relief, restitution, penalties, damages, and other relief that a court may deem just and proper.

The unlawful and illegal conduct under consideration by our Office includes, but is not limited to, the following:

(a) Running a book-making or other kind of gambling business in violation of Article I, Section 9 of the New York State Constitution;
(b) Knowingly advancing and profiting from unlawful gambling activity by receiving and accepting in any one day, more than five bets totaling more than five thousand dollars in violation of New York Penal Law § 225.10;
(c) Knowingly advancing or profiting from unlawful gambling activity in violation of New York Penal Law § 225.05;
(d) With knowledge of the contents thereof, possessing any writing, paper, instrument or article of a kind commonly used in the operation or promotion of a bookmaking scheme or enterprise and constituting, reflecting or representing more than five bets totaling more than five thousand dollars in violation of New York Penal Law § 225.20;
(e) With knowledge of the contents thereof, possessing any writing, paper, instrument or article of a kind commonly used in the operation or promotion of a bookmaking
scheme or enterprise in violation of New York Penal Law § 225.15;
(f) Misrepresenting that DraftKings complies with applicable laws; misrepresenting the likelihood that an ordinary player will win a jackpot; misrepresenting the degree of skill implicated in the games; and misrepresenting that DraftKings’ games are not considered gambling, in violation of Executive Law § 63(12) and GBL §§ 349 and 350; and
(g) Conducting or transacting its business in a persistently fraudulent and illegal manner in violation of BCL § 1303.

Pursuant to GBL §§ 349 and 350, DraftKings is afforded the opportunity to show orally or in writing to this Office, within five business days of receipt of this notice, why the Attorney
General should not initiate any proceedings.

Sincerely,
Kathleen McGee
Chief, Internet Bureau

Little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got (You don't know what I got)
Little deuce coupe

Well I'm not bragging babe so don't put me down (deuce coupe)
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town (deuce coupe)
When something comes up to me he don't even try (deuce coupe)

Just a little deuce coupe with a flathead mill (deuce coupe)

She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored

[Chorus]

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip, daddy

[Verse 3]
And coming off the line when the light turns green (deuce coupe)
Well she blows them out of the water like you never seen (deuce coupe)
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer (deuce coupe)
When I get rubber in all four gears

201,Wonderful! Wonderful!,"Sometimes we walk, hand in hand by the sea
And we breathe in the cool salty air
You turn to me, with a kiss in your eyes
And my heart feels a thrill beyond compare
Then your lips cling to mine, it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

Sometimes we stand, on the top of a hill
And we gaze at the earth and the sky
I turn to you, and you melt in my arms
Here we are, Darling, only you and I
What a moment to share, it's wonderful, wonderful
Oh, so wonderful, my love

The world is full of wondrous things, it's true
But they wouldn't have much meaning without you

Some quiet evening, I sit by your side
And we're lost in a world of our own
I feel the glow of your arms open love
I'm aware of the treasure that I hold

Oh, so wonderful, my love.'

A bunch of pussies, when you piss, you gotta be sittin'
You tie your hair in a bun and shirt in a knot
You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka
Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker
You and your father never played catch, he taught you how to twerk
Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up
And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp
Shit, light the earth

I saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound

It seemed I was the first one there, and so I was surprised
To see the Martian twist and stomp before my very eyes
The did the Loco-Motion and the Hully Gully too
I couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do

Eeee-eeee-eeeeee
The Martian Hop

Now right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun
The Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun
And so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground
And even though I'm back on earth I still can hear this sound

Had it repeating, had it repeating

You were my September Song, summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you’re only fifteen

Do you remember me? We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus, they were singing it for us
You were my September song, tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? We were only fifteen

Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station
Passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers

Still, I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating, got it repeating

Wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo, wo
Hey!

Gotta tell him that I adore him
There is nothin' that I wouldn't do for him
I won't be happy till I make him mine
And a wedding day is set

217,Mockingbird,"[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)",Eminem,1963,"[55, 51, 39, 28, 17, 10, 7, 8, 12, 13, 22, 27, 41, 59, 72, 76, 82, 90]",18
218,Treat My Baby Good,"You better treat my baby good if you know what's good for you
You better never make her cry
Go on, make one mistake and I'll step in and take away the ache in her heart
So play it smart

You better treat my baby good if you know what's good for you
Don't ever let me see her blue
Go ahead and put her down once too often around a friend in town and you'll see
She's back with me

Who am I kiddin'?

She's better off without me now and I know that's good for you
But, all the same, keep this in mind
Just make sure ev'ry day that you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good

Just make sure ev'ry day that you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should
Treat my baby good

Just make sure ev'ry day
That you treat her the way she'd like to say that you should

From a very far away place

Please (Shake that body, party that bod-)
Please (Shake that body, party that body)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

[Bridge: Larry Graham]
I just keep on lovin' you, baby
And there's no one else I know can take your pla-, pla-, pla-

[Chorus: Kanye West & Junie Morrison]
Please, no more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh
No more parties in L.A.

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again, guilty feet have got no rhythm

I should have known better than to cheat a friend

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay

					Revised First Draft Screenplay

							    by

						   Tom Mankiewicz

											   June 20, 1983


FADE IN:

SUPERIMPOSED ON A BLACK SCREEN:

WAYNE MANOR, NEAR GOTHAM CITY - 1960

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - SUNSET

A beautiful, sprawling suburban estate at sunset.  Classic wrought-iron
gates protect a winding driveway which snakes its way up through a
neatly manicured lawn.

INT. WAYNE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ALFRED PENNYWORTH, the Wayne family butler, fluffs up a cushion in the
large, elegant living room.  A kind-looking man in his late forties
with dark moustache and hair, he epitomizes the proper British moor
domo, dressed in a morning coat and striped vest.

Alfred turns, straightens up a pile of thick-looking papers on the
living room table.  He picks up the top one, looks at it critically,
but with satisfaction.

INSERT SHOT - CAMPAIGN POSTER

The thick-looking papers are, in fact, political campaign posters.
They feature the face of a handsome, fortyish man, with the block
lettered caption: DR. THOMAS WAYNE FOR CITY COUNCIL - A BETTER TOMORROW
FOR GOTHAM.

DR. WAYNE'S VOICE
Bruce?  Hurry up, son, we're going
to be late.  Martha?

BACK TO SCENE

Alfred turns to look at DR. THOMAS WAYNE (the man on the poster) enters
the room.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Now where's Martha?  Alfred, have
you seen Mrs. Wayne?

ALFRED
I believe she was headed for Master
Bruce's laboratory. Sir.

Dr. Wayne checks his watch, exits, muttering.

DR. WAYNE
That nymphomaniacal hamster of his
must have given birth again...


INT. HALLWAY

Dr. Wayne heads down the hallway towards a door.

DR. WAYNE
Come on, everybody, the movie starts
in less than an hour.  Let's not
keep you next city councilman
waiting...

INT. BRUCE'S LAB

Dr. Wayne opens the door.  The makeshift lab room has a large work
table crammed with beakers, test tubes, and other scientific equipment.
BRUCE WYANE, aged ten, sits behind a microscope, peers down intently at
a specimen on a slide.  He does not look up as his father enters.

DR. WAYNE
(crossing)
Son, whatever you're looking at
couldn't possible be as pretty as
Audrey Hepburn, so...

Dr. Wayne puts his hand on Bruce's shoulder.  Incredibly enough - it
passes right through it!  He recoils, shocked, reaches out to touch the
body's head.  His hand cuts right through the skull.  Giggling is
HEARD, O.S.

Young Bruce stands behind the door with his mother, MARTHA, a beautiful
woman in her mid-thirties.

BRUCE
It's called a ""holograph,"" dad.  Two
Interconnecting laser beams...
(pointing)
There and there.  Pretty neat, huh?

Dr. Wayne stares at the laser tubes, totally nonplussed.

MARTHA
Well, don't look at me.  My side
of the family still can't figure out
why it gets dark at night.  Ready to
go?

DR. WAYNE
(eyes narrowing)
How can I be sure you're the real
thing?

Martha kisses him warmly.  He looks back, impressed.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Somewhat lifelike, I'll admit...

MARTH
That's all?  Then hold on to your
socks, buster...

She kisses him again with passion.  Bruce turns away with the typical
self-consciousness of a pre-adolescent.

BRUCE
Oh, guy...

His parents break.  Dr. Wayne looks down at him.

DR. WAYNE
Bruce, you may be the brightest ten
year old in Gotham City, or any-
where else, for that matter.  But I
feel I ought to let you in on some-
thing.
(at Martha)
This - is definitely not a guy.

INT. PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

A huge 35mm motion picture projector springs to life.

INT. THEATER

The shifting colored rays of a projected film knife though the
blackness of the theater.

SCREEN VOICE
Sister, you make a beautiful nun.

ANGLE ON MOVIE SCREEN

The screen is filled by the face of AUDREY HEPBURN, dressed as a nun.
We are watched The Nun's Story, as are:

ANGLE ON WAYNE FAMILY IN SEATS

Dr. Wayne, Martha, and Bruce, who downs the remains of his box of Good
and Plenty.

EXT. GOTHAM MOVIE THEATER & STREET - NIGHT

Rumblings of distant thunder echo through the night sky.  The Wayne
family exits the theater, heads down a deserted street.  Suddenly - a
flash of lightning.  A closer, louder clap of thunder.  Dr. Wayne takes
Martha's arm.  Bruce straggles behind, staring at the pavement.

DR. WAYNE
I wish I hadn't parked so far away.
We're going to get soaked.

MARTHA
(over her shoulder)
Do try and keep up, Bruce.  What on
earth are you staring at, anyway?

BRUCE
The cracks, Mom.  It's bad luck to
step on one.
(does so)
Oh, darnit...

VOICE (O.S.)
Hold it, you people.  Freeze!

A large man (JOE CHILL) partially hidden by shadows, points a gun at
them.  He stands in the sunken entrance to a deserted brownstone house,
gestures with his weapon.

CHILL
Get down in here.  Now.

MARTHA
(terrified)
Thomas...

DR. WAYNE
You're welcome to our money.  Any-
thing we have.  Okay?

Chill stares coldly.  Dr. Wayne pulls out his money, takes off his
watch.  Martha and Bruce watch, petrified.

DR. WAYNE (CONT'D)
Here...just be careful with that
gun, will you?  It could go off...

CHILL
You know something, Doc?  You're
right.

DR. WAYNE
(expression changing)
Doc?  How did you know I was a...

There is a deafening roar as Chill fires the gun, lifting Dr. Wayne off
his feet, hurling him backwards.

BRUCE
Daddy!!

Martha screams.  A bolt of lightning flashes.  Chill turns.

CHILL
Let's have that necklace, lady...

MARTHA
Oh, my God!

Martha tries to escape but is jerked back by Chill's hand as it closes
on her necklace.  Bruce runs at Chill, grabs him by the leg, tries to
pull him down.

BRUCE
Leave my mommy alone!  Mommy!
Mommy!

Chill fires again!  The necklace snaps free as Martha is jerked
backwards, then crumples next to her husband.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

He kneels over his mother's body, pauses in shock, then looks up: the
barrel of Chill's gun comes into frame.

CLOSE ON CHILL

The necklace in one hand, his gun in the other.  He looks down at
Bruce, his expression suddenly changing.

BACK TO BRUCE

He stares at Chill, his jaw inadvertently twitching with rage.  A LOUD
CLAP OF THUNDER rolls across the sky.  Bruce's eyes have become steel,
visible fury shooting forth from them in an almost demonic fashion.

Chill's gun hand suddenly starts to tremble.  Incredibly, the savage
face of this young boy has unnerved him.

CHILL
Stop...lookin' at me like that, kid...
(no response)
Stop looking at me like that!

Suddenly - A FLASH OF LIGHTNING!  Rain begins to fall in sheets.
Chill, runs up to the street, disappears into the rain-swept darkness.

ANGLE ON APARTMENT BUILDING

LIGHTS have flicked on in the apartment building across the street.
FACELESS WITNESSES stand silhouetted in the windows, gazing down at the
tragedy across the street.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on one particular window.  A SHADOWY FIGURE half-
emerges from the darkness, his face still hidden from us.  All that is
visible is an oversized pair of striped pants and a large white daisy
stuck through the coat lapel.  The Shadowy Figure pauses, then reaches
out an arm and slowly lowers the window shade.

From behind the shade - an insane, maniacal giggle starts to rise.
Tiny at first, but gradually building to a sudden explosion of
cascading, frightening glee!

BACK TO BRUCE

Kneeling in the rain across the street, paralyzed with shock and grief.
He looks up from the bodies of his parents as a COUPLE approaches along
the pavement above.

BRUCE'S VOICE
Help...oh, please help me...

The couple stop, stare down at the scene.

BRUCE
It's...my mom and dad.  Please...I
think they're dead.

The couple exchange a quick, horrified glance, then hurry off down the
street.

BACK TO BRUCE

Sobbing uncontrollably now, tears mixing with the rain.  In the
distance: the low whine of an approaching siren.  CAMERA RISES into the
night sky:

A FLASHING BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SCREEN: the residue
remains in the night sky - a searing yellow dot.  ANOTHER BOLT OF
LIGHTNING - another yellow dot.  Then a deafening clap of thunder as
the gray-black clouds arrange themselves into a dark and eerie
silhouette.  The siren grows louder, piercing shrilly through the
rumblings of the storm.  The SILHOUETTE becomes more familiar now, as
the billowing clouds form themselves into a dark cape.  The dots of
lightning begin to pulsate as they evolve into two searing yellow eyes.

This then, is the signal of the future presence of the Dark Redeemer of
the Night.  The Black Wraith.  The Avenger of Countless Wrongs...

							 THE BATMAN

												DISSOLVE
THROUGH TO:

EXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY NEAR GOTHAM - DAY

A beautiful rolling hill overlooking Gotham City.  As CAMERA TRACKS
through the trees, tombstones begin to appear.  We are in the middle of
an immaculate pastoral graveyard.  Down below in the distance an
endless line of black limousines snakes its way up a winding road.
CAMERA CONTINUES TO TRACK, finally HOLDING ON:

The unfilled graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne.  Dark-suited FUNERAL
ATTENDANTS wait silently by the caskets.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

A hot sun showers a blazing glow on the throbbing metropolis of Gotham
City, choked with cars, buses, PEDESTRIANS, and the attendant
pollution.  A great American city going through the routine
performances of its daily mundane chores.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on an oversized pair of striped pants standing in front of
a corner newsstand.

VOICE
A copy of the Trib, please.

CLOSE ON GOTHAM TRIBUNE

An edition of the Gotham Tribune is handed over.  The headlines scream:
DR. & MRS. THOMAS WAYNE GUNNED DOWN IN SENSELESS ROBBERY/KILLING.
""Political hopeful was well ahead in latest polls.""

An insane giggle rises, O.S.  CAMERA PANS UP from the front page to the
horrified face of a NEWS VENDOR, staring in disbelief at the person
reading the Tribune.

CLOSE ON JOKER - HIS P.O.V.

We see the hideous face of THE JOKER.  A revolting perversion of a
human being with a chalk-white complexion, ruby red lips, and a
startling shock of green hair.  He continues to giggle as he reads.  A
CONFEDERATE stands behind.  The Vendor continues to stare as The Joker
suddenly notices.

JOKER
Something wrong?

VENDOR
Your...face.  It's...

JOKER
Familiar?  Maybe we met in Toledo.

VENDOR
I never been to Toledo.

JOKER
Neither have I.  Must have been two
other guys.
(taking one out)
Have a cigar?

VENDOR
Gee, thanks.

The Vendor takes the cigar, lights it.  The Joker and his Confederate
move off down the street.

JOKER
Want to hear a good one?  What's
black and white and dead all over?

CONFEDERATE
A newspaper, Boss, but ain't it
black and white and read all over?

Suddenly - there is a tremendous explosion!

ANGLE ON CORNER NEWSSTAND

The corner newsstand has virtually disappeared.  Thousands of pages
drift down through the air into the debris.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
No...

EXT. HILLSIDE CEMETERY - DAY

The procession of limousines has started back down the hill from the
funeral.  Alfred stands alone by a black Rolls Royce, looks off sadly
as:

Young Bruce Wayne gently places a flower on each of his parent's
graves, then turns.  His eyes are glassed over, but tears do not fall.
He crosses to Alfred who puts a protective arm around him.

ALFRED
It's unfair, of course.  But some-
times, Master Bruce, one simply has
to...accept conditions as they are,
and...make the best of them.

BRUCE
(softly)
Why?

ALFRED
Why?  Why, because...
(nice smile)
I don't know, really.

BRUCE
(deadly)
Neither do I.

Alfred helps the boy into the car.  The Rolls Royce heads back down the
hill toward Gotham City.

INT. THORNE CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Telephones RING!  Typewriters CLACK!  A campaign poster features the
face of RUPERT THORNE, an earnest-looking man with a granite-hard face.
Underneath is a logo: Rupert Thorne: He'll make our streets safe
again.""

The headquarters is a beehive of activity.  AIDES rush back and forth
as a door marked Private bursts open and Thorne appears.  Hr grins with
an oily manner.

THORNE
(to AIDE)
Are they all out there?

AIDE
We're waiting for The Evening
Sentinel, Mr. Thorne...

THORNE
Screw The Sentinel.  I gotta make
The six o'clock news.
(adjusts his tie)
What's the name of Wayne's kid?

AIDE
Bruce.

Thorne nods, heads for the door, mumbling to himself.

THORNE
Our hearts go out to the Wayne
Family, particularly their young
Son, Bruce...Bruce...Bruce...

EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A throng of REPORTERS and TV remote units snap to attention as Thorne
appears on the steps of his campaign headquarters.  He silences a
cacophony of overlapping questions with upraised hands, terminally
sincere.

THORNE
I didn't want to win like this.  Not
through tragedy.  But it's cruelly
ironic...

EXT. GOTHAM - DAY

A more downbeat section of Gotham's business district.  CAMERA CLOSES
on a specific building: The Monarch Playing Card Company.  THORNE'S
VOICE CONTINUES OVER:

THORNE'S VOICE
...that a good man like Thomas Wayne
who spoke up so forcefully for the
rights of criminals should himself
become the ultimate victim.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

A huge room, garishly decorated in a clown motif.  The wallpaper is one
contiguous deck of cards.  There are harlequin chairs, jesters, and
open Jack-In-The-Box, etc.

A MAN sits in a chair at the end of the room, facing away from CAMERA.
He watches Thorne on a TV set.

THORNE
(from TV)
But his murderer will be caught and
executed, I promise you!  It's time
the scum of our society see that we
mean to have law and order on the
streets of Gotham City!

Suddenly - the set goes mute.  The Man in the chair swivels around
slowly: It is JOE CHILL!

The Joker stands at the entrance to the room, lowers a remote control
box.  He grins at Chill.  Chill stares back nervously, clearly
frightened by The Joker's maniacal presence.

CHILL
I was...headed for the airport.
They said you wanted to see me.
Something...wrong?

JOKER
Wrong?  I thought we'd celebrate.  I
thought you'd like to join me in a
drink.

CHILL
(visibly relieved)
Why not...

The Joker leads him to a table, suddenly glowers darkly.

JOKER
You know, I'm disappointed in you,
Joe.  Very disappointed.

CHILL
(swallowing)
You...are?

JOKER
I said, ""Would you like to join me
in a drink.""  Then you're supposed
to say, ""Sure there'll be room
enough for both of us?""
(giggle)
Get it?
(louder giggle)
""Room enough...""

CHILL
Yeah...sure...I get it now...

JOKER
You're a quick study, Joe.

The Joker claps him on the back as they sit at the table.  The
Confederate enters with two glasses on a tray.  One contains a clear
liquid.  The other - a bilious, thick yellow concoction.  The Joker
edges it across the table toward Chill who eyes it suspiciously.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Drink up.

Chill examines the yellow liquid, wary.

CHILL
How come...you ain't drinkin' this...

JOKER
Good question.  I like lemonade...

He takes it from Chill, hands him the clear liquid.  They both down
their drinks.  The Joker giggles insanely.

CHILL
What's...so funny...?

JOKER
Man walks into a doctor's office,
says, ""Are you the doctor's nurse?""
she says, ""Yes.""  He says, ""Oh, is
the doctor sick?""

The Joker slams the table in glee, out of control.

CHILL
No offense, Joker, but that's not
very...

Chill stops.  The corners of his mouth twitch, then rise involuntarily.
He snickers.  Again.  Starts to giggle.  The Joker's eyes narrow.  His
smile becomes cruel.

JOKER
The doctor says, ""I can sure you.  The
disease is hereditary.""  The patient
says, ""Then send the bill to my father.""

Chill instantly explodes with laughter!

JOKER (CONT'D)
He says, ""Help me, Doctor, I've got
amnesia.""  Doctor says, ""How long
have you had it?""  He says, ""How
long have I had what?""

Chill is on his feet now, convulsed in glee.  He sinks to his knees,
out of control, then collapses on the floor.

JOKER (CONT'D)
And this one will kill you!  I just got
back from a pleasure trip.  I drove my
mother-in-law to the airport...

CLOSE ON CHILL

Dead.  His mouth frozen in a grotesque grin.  The Joker stares down
blankly.

JOKER
But seriously, folks...

He looks off, presses the remote control box, activates the sound on
the television again.

CLOSE ON TV

Rupert Thorne leans in with an oily look.

THORNE ON TV
In the meantime, our hearts go out
to the Wayne family, particularly to
their young son, Bruce...

BACK TO JOKER

Watching Thorne.  His face twists into a cruel smile.

THORNE
(thoughtful pause)
And I'd like to think that one day
Thomas Wayne will look down on this
earth and this city and say...

As Thorne and The Joker speak simultaneously.

THORNE & JOKER
""You know what?  I was wrong.  That
Rupert Thorne is one heck of a city
councilman.""

The Joker explodes in laughter!  His terrifying guffaws propel him off
the chair onto the floor.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

A large truck with the logo ""GOTHAM GYMNASTICS"" starts down the
driveway to the gates, moving away from Wayne Manor.

INT. MANOR EXERCISE ROOM - DAT

Alfred and Bruce stand in a newly outfitted exercise room.  The
equipment has been expertly installed: rings, parallel bars, balancing
beam, weight machines, etc.  Bruce is in a T-shirt and shorts.  He
gazes at the impressive array.

ALFRED
One hardly knows where to begin.

BRUCE
Those rings seem simple enough.

Bruce crosses to the rings, leaps, catches hold, tries to hoist himself
up.  His eyes bulge!  He tries again, then drops to the floor in a
heap.

ALFRED
Perhaps if we lowered them.

BRUCE
(grim stare)
If you'll excuse me now, Alfred.
I'll see you at dinner.

ALFRED
Yes, Sir.

Alfred leaves, closing the door.  Bruce turns, glares up at the rings
like deadly enemies.  He jumps again, catches hold, starts to hoist
himself up, straining with the effort.  The veins standing out on his
forehead.  Slowly, painfully, he begins to inch himself higher and
higher.

INT KARATE STUDIO - DAY

Bruce is dressed in a martial arts outfit, tensely faces a thick pine
board being held by a Japanese INSTRUCTOR.

INSTRUCTOR
...but you must believe, really
believe you can do it.  The mind
is more powerful than the fist, and
the fist is more powerful than the
board.  Understood?

Bruce nods earnestly, sets himself.  With a blood-curdling SCREAM -- he
lashes out!  Then - an instantaneous second SCREAM as his fist crumples
against the unyielding board.

INSTRUCTOR (CONT'D)
Let's go over it again...

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SUNRISE

A tree-lined winding road at dawn.  Bruce jogs along easily, his right
hand encased in a plaster cast.  Jogging next to him, huffing and
puffing: an exhausted FRENCH PROFESSOR.

BRUCE
I am happy...

FRENCH PROFESSOR
(panting)
Je suis heureux...

BRUCE
Je suis heureux...to make your
acquaintance.

FRENCH PROFESSOR
(gasping)
De...faire votre connaissance...

BRUCE
De faire votre connaissance...

Bruce looks ahead toward a bend in the road.  Alfred stands by the
Rolls Royce, checking his watch.  The spent Professor peels off to the
side as Bruce continues on.

BRUCE
Merci, mon Professeur!  Tommorrow at
Six again, okay?

The Professor manages a feeble wave, collapses by the side of the road
in front of Alfred who administers a thermos of hot coffee and a
croissant to the stricken man.

ANGLE AROUND OTHER SIDE OF BEND.

Another jogger has joined Bruce around the bend - an older man, his
bearded RUSSIAN PROFESSOR.

BRUCE
Dobroye utro, Boris...I am happy...

BORIS
Ochen priyatno...

BRUCE
Ochen priyatno...To make your
acquaintance.

BORIS
Vam...poznakomit...

The two of them jog off into the distance.

BORIS' VOICE
(already winded)
Bozhe moy!...

EXT. WAYNE MANOR LAWN - DAY

Bruce stands facing a large, brightly colored archery target on the
lawn of Wayne Manor.  From O.S., behind his back, WE HEAR A WHIRRING
SOUND.

CLOSE ON ARROW GUN

A gleaming STEEL ARROW ""clicks"" into the firing slot of an automatic-
fire Gatling Gun device.  Suddenly - it fires!

BACK TO BRUCE

Wheeling around to face the on-rushing whizzing arrow - lifting a
heavily padded hand to catch it in mid-air!

HE MISSES!  The arrow ""thunks"" into his chest, directly over his heart!
Bruce sighs, removes the arrow, jerking it out of his hidden protective
vest.

BRUCE
Darn...

ANOTHER ARROW whizzes at him!  Bruce drops to one knee, this time
almost catching it as the steel tip rips away a piece of the heavy
padding on his hand.

CLOSE ON ALFRED AT WINDOW

Alfred watches from a window, shaking his head, appalled, now returns
to his housekeeping.

INT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

Bruce is on the rings again.  By now using them with considerable
expertise, swinging his body in somersaults, then performing the
difficult ""Iron Cross"" maneuver.  He pauses at full extension, then
swings back, launches himself towards the parallel bars.

Catching the bars expertly, he performs a complicated routine, pausing
at the top to look across the room:

A thin balance beam sits below, ten feet away.

Bruce swings back one more time on the upper parallel bar, then flies
through the air for the beam!  His feet land on top for one split,
tenuous second.  He teeters - then crashes heavily to the floor.
Shaking his head to clear the cobwebs, he stares back at the beam,
determined.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Alfred exits the rear of Wayne Manor onto the lawn, looks around,
mystified.

ALFRED
Master Bruce?  Luncheon is served!

Alfred hears a CUMBLING SOUND, looks up as a piece of brick falls,
narrowly missing him.

ANGLE ON BRUCE - ALFRED'S P.O.V.

Bruce is scaling the side of the house!  A thick rope encircles the
chimney of Wayne Manor as Bruce makes his way up the structure, hand
over hand.  Suddenly:  the old brick chimney STARTS TO CRUMBLE!  The
rope jerks free as bricks fly everywhere and Bruce tumbles heavily down
to the lawn at Alfred'' feet.

Bruce looks up, grins sheepishly.  Alfred glances back up at the
demolished chimney, then back down at Bruce again.

ALFRED
Santa will be heartbroken.

INT. KARATE STUDIO - DAY

A TERRIFYING SCREAM!  A PINE BOARD is smashed to smithereens by a
lightning-quick fist!

Bruce wheels to FACE CAMERA.  HE IS NOW SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD.  Cool,
clear eyes flick in the opposite direction as:

Two STUDENTS charge him!  He flips one over his head, flips the other
while simultaneously spinning around to face the Instructor who closes
ranks from behind.

The fight is furiously expert - hands and feet working like windmills.
Bruce is parrying every thrust the
Instructor has to offer, countering every move, but is nonetheless
being backed into a corner.

The Instructor moves in for the kill as Bruce suddenly vaults up and
over him in a seven-foot backflip!  Grabbing the man's black belt from
behind for leverage, he hoists the Instructor over his head, then sends
the bewildered man flying through the air, crashing onto the mat in a
heap.

Bruce looks over, suddenly concerned.  He holds the Instructor's black
belt in his hands.  The Instructor is half-dazed, in some pain.  His
eyes suddenly pop open - he grins broadly back at Bruce.

INSTRUCTOR
That's okay.  Keep it.

INT. BALLET STUDIO - DAY

A line of beautiful young would-be BALLERINAS perform the various
positions at the bar in a dance studio to the musical strains of Swan
Lake.  A stern INSTRUCTRESS supervises, barking out the numbers.

CAMERA TRACKS past the female figures at the bar.  In the middle of the
line, dressed in tight and a T-shirt - Bruce Wayne.  Perspiring
heavily, he performs the set routine with amazing grace.  A gorgeous
DANCER looks over her shoulder at him, whispers under her breath.

GIRL DANCER
Any of the guys ever make fun of
you?

BRUCE
(nice smile)
One guy.  Once.

INT. BROKERAGE FIRM - DAY

A stock ticker jumps to life.  CAMERA PANS the oak-panelled walls of a
room, PAST portrait paintings of sever-looking BROKERS in three-piece
suits.

BROKER'S VOICE
...the sizeable trust fund left you
by your father, the late Dr. Thomas
Wayne.  Now we admit that young
Bruce here has made a few lucky
guesses in the past..

CAMERA HOLDS on a board room conference table:  two impeccably turned-
out BROKERS face Alfred and Bruce.

BROKER (CONT'D)
...but the time has come for us to
insist on control.  We appeal to
you, Mr. Pennyworth, as the executor
of this estate.

ALFRED
It was Dr. Wayne's intention for his
son to achieve self-reliance at the
earliest possible age.  With that in
mind, I suggest you accept the lad's
""lucky guesses"" as instructions.

BRUCE
Let's hold on to our oil stocks for
now.  I see a chance of gasoline
prices rising to sixty, even seventy
cents a gallon.

BROKER
(tolerant smile)
Why not a dollar?

BRUCE
And I'd like to transfer our mutual
funds into the development of the
computer chip.  I've been experi-
menting with them, and...

BROKER
Computer...

BRUCE
Chip.

BROKER #2
Sounds like an after-school snack
for machines.  Anything else?

BRUCE
As a matter of fact, there is.
Yesterday, I had this most delicious
hamburger at this new little place
called MacDonald's...

The two Brokers exchange a totally exasperated look.

EXT. MONUMENT VALLEY - DAY

CAMERA PANS a campsite with pup tents and a burnt-out campfire to a van
featuring the logo: Gotham High School Mountaineering Club.

ANGLE ON ROCK NEEDLE

A towering needle-like rock shoots up from the desert floor.  CAMERA
PUSHES IN:  we see the outlines of THREE CLIMBERS connected by a rope,
halfway up he jagged face.

CLOSE ON CLIMBERS

The wind howls.  The FIRST CLIMBER drives a piton into the rock face,
attaches his line, looks down.

TWO CLIMBERS below struggle mightily.  The drop to the desert floor
beneath is dizzying.  Climber #2 looks up.

CLIMBER #2
Don't look down, for Chrissake!

CLIMBER #1
I'm trying to see if I can spot
Bruce...

CLIMBER #2
Will you forget about him?  He wan-
dered off, that's all - in one of
his famous moods.

CLIMBER #1
(drives in piton)
Who knows?  Maybe the great Bruce
Wayne finally found something he's
too scared to tackle...

ANGLE ON ROCK NEEDLE - HELICOPTER SHOT

HELICOPTER ZOOMS UP and around to the far side of the needle - one lone
figure struggles up the absolutely sheer opposite face of the cliff, a
few feet from the top.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

His jaw set - eyes clear.  The bitter wind whips through his hair.  He
drives in his final piton, hoists himself up onto the tiny circular
crest of the needle.

HELICOPTER CAMERA RISES.  The majestic valley spreads out below us.  In
the center - the lonely figure of Bruce Wayne - self-reliance and
victory personified.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It is late.  Alfred relaxes in an easy chair, reading an edition of the
Gotham Tribune.

The headline screams:  JOKER STEALS KALAHARI DIAMOND - Master of Mirth
Strikes Again.

Alfred puts down the paper, stifling a yawn.  He hears A MUTED VOICE
from upstairs, rises curiously.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bruce is spread-eagled on the bed, fully clothed - fast asleep.  A
VOICE drones from a bedside tape recorder.

TAPE VOICE
An atom with a magnetic dipole ex-
posed to a nonuniform magnetic field
undergoes a linear force in addition
to its tendency toward orientation...

Alfred stops in the doorway with a sympathetic look.

TAPE VOICE (CONT'D)
The use of an atomic beam makes
possible an observation of an
induced transition...

Alfred switches off the tape, adjusts a quilted coverlet over Bruce
with a paternal smile.

INT. EXERCISE ROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS past the balancing beam, parallel bars, and exercise rings
to Bruce, who faces them confidently, but this time with a big
difference - HE IS BLINDFOLDED.  He takes a tentative step forward,
gauging his distance, then leaps up into the air - grabbing the rings
with perfect accuracy!  He performs a series of difficult routines with
clockwork precision, then swings through the air to the parallel bars,
latching on to the lower one, then propelling himself up to the higher
one.  His gyrations become faster, gaining speed and momentum.
Suddenly - he launches himself toward the balance beam!

Bruce lands on the end of the beam like a cat - keeping his balance,
having calculated the exact distance to the inch.  He steps forward
with total security, travels the length of the beam with the ease of a
pedestrian.  Reaching the end, he does a complete forward somersault,
lands solidly on his feet.  Bruce removes his blindfold, stares back at
the path he's just taken, amazed by himself.

ALFRED'S VOICE
Incredible!

Bruce turns.  A proud Alfred beams from the doorway.

ALFRED
Why, you were blind as a bat, Sir.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Bruce's grinning face as WE HEAR:

PRINCIPAL'S VOICE
...many talented, successful gradu-
ates of Gotham High, but none like
this young man.  Holder of the
highest scholastic average in the
history of the school...

EXT. GOTHAM HIGH SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY

CAMERA PANS the front lawn of Gotham High School.  It is Graduation
Day.  STUDENTS and proud PARENTS sit in chairs facing a rostrum, from
where the PRINCIPAL speaks:

PRINCIPAL
...eight athletic letters and
Captain of five teams, your Class
Valedictorian - Bruce Wayne!

Applause.  Bruce rises in his cap and gown, makes his way to the
rostrum.  A confident presence glows behind his clear eyes.  A self-
assuredness without ego.  A natural grace which exudes the maturity of
a man twice his age.  CAMERA PANS TO the figure of Alfred, who beams
with pride.

BRUCE
Thank you, Principal Peters.  Fellow
students, welcome parents, honored
faculty and guests...

EXT. BACK FO SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

Bruce hurries down the steps in his black cap and gown, diploma in
hand.  A pretty COED (CINDY) passes.

CINDY
Great speech, Bruce.  I sure hope
you're coming to Deedee's tonight...

BRUCE
Thanks, Cindy, but I don't think I
can make it.  Marshall McLuhan is
giving a talk at the University.

CINDY
Bruce...

He turns.  Cindy looks at him shyly, then moves closer.

CINDY (CONT'D)
I...hope you don't mind me saying
this, Bruce, but...well, I guess all
the girls feel the same way...

BRUCE
Feel...?

CINDY
It's just that everybody thinks
you're great...great looking and
everything...but you never seem to
have time for any...fun.

BRUCE
Fun?  What...kind of fun?

Cindy stares into his eyes with a mixture of hunger and innocence.  She
leans in, kisses him softly and deeply on the mouth.  Bruce's eyes
bulge with surprise, then slowly flutter shut.  They finally break.

CINDY
(passionate whisper)
275...7634...

Bruce smiles, slides by, heads down the steps.  Cindy watches
wistfully.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

The Rolls Royce makes its way through the crowded streets.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE - DAY

Bruce stares out the window.  Alfred drives on, takes a small notebook
from his pocket, reads.

ALFRED
You have your guitar lesson at four,
following which, you wanted time to
finish your article for The Scien-
tific American.  Tonight, Marshall
McLuhan lectures at...

Alfred stops.  Bruce is lost in another world.

ALFRED (CONT'D)
Are you all right, Sir?

BRUCE
Hmm?

Bruce turns from the window.  Alfred notices something.

ALFRED
Is that blood on your lip?

Bruce frowns curiously.  He wipes his lip with his finger, then licks
it thoughtfully.

BRUCE
Lipstick.

ALFRED
(shocked)
Lipstick?

BRUCE
Lipstick.

Alfred smiles uncomfortably.  The Rolls stops at a light.  Bruce
notices something out the window.

ANGLE OF SHOWROOM - HIS P.O.V.

An elegant foreign car showroom.  In the window, its front grill
grinning back at Bruce - a BRIGHT RED FERRARI.

BACK TO ROLLS ROYCE.

BRUCE
(muttering)
275-7634...

ALFRED
Beg pardon?

BRUCE
Do you know what's wrong with me,
Alfred?

ALFRED
I can't imagine a thing, Sir.

BRUCE
I never have time for any fun.

EXT. BEACH - DAWN

The first orange rays of the sun stab upwards through the clouds in a
brilliant sunrise.  The bright red Ferrari is parked in the sand on the
top of a high dune.  The VOICES of BRUCE and CINDY drift up from below.

BRUCE'S VOICE
(sleepy; affectionate)
Good morning...

CINDY'S VOICE
Mmm...

BRUCE'S VOICE
Want to go for a swim?

CINDY'S VOICE
(pleased)
I don't think I can walk...
(soft purr)
Where'd you learn to do all that?

BRUCE'S VOICE
Here.  Last night.  It's strange,
but once I get the hang of something
I just can't seem to stop.
(beat)
Sorry.

CINDY'S VOICE
(dreamy)
Oh...that's okay...

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Ferrari as the ROAR of a powerful racing engine is
heard, gather in intensity.

EXT. GOTHAM RACETRACK - DAY

A gleaming red Formula One racing car ROARS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE to
the waving of a black-checkered flag and the WILD CHEERS of the CROWD.

ANGLE ON WINNER'S CIRCLE

WE SEE THE ADULT BRUCE WAYNE sitting in his racing machine, holding up
a trophy under a banner:  WINNER - GOTHAM 500.

Flashbulbs pop!  FANS cheer!  A BUXOM MISS GOTHAM leans in to pose for
pictures with Bruce and share champagne from the trophy cup.  A
disgruntled MARIO ANDRETTI elbows his way through the throng to shake
hands with the winner.

MARIO ANDRETTI
Hell of a race, Bruce.

BRUCE
Thanks, Mario.

ANDRETTI
Remember how you told me this was
just a hobby?  Well keep it that way
and let the rest of us make a
living, okay?

Miss Gotham leans in, hugs Bruce tightly, giggles, then whispers
something in his ear.  Bruce looks up.

BRUCE
(at Miss Gotham)
That's your hobby?
(grins)
No kidding.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

The Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  The headline reads:
PRESIDENT DECLARED - I AM NOT A CROOK!

Farther down the page is a smaller headline, reading:  BRUCE WAYNE
DECLARES - I AM NOT THE FATHER!  Millionaire playboy cleared in Miss
Gotham paternity suit.

EXT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY

A throng a REPORTERS waits with a predominantly FEMALE CROWD at the
entrance to Gotham Courthouse.

Bruce suddenly appears in the Courthouse doorway as a LOUD CHEER rises
from the Female Crowd.  He elbows his way through them, Alfred at his
side.  FLASHBULBS POP!  The Women scream and reach out at him, trying
to tear off a souvenir.  REPORTERS yell overlapping questions.

BRUCE
Sorry, no comment.  Sorry...

ALFRED
(at hysterical Woman)
Madame, do try to compose yourself...

They reach the sidewalk and the car.  Alfred heads for the front door
as Bruce jostles his way inside the back.

INT. ROLLS - DAY

Bruce slams the door shut behind him, turns, stops, stares:  Already
sitting in the back seat is a beautiful FEMALE REPORTER, legs crossed,
perfectly composed, with a portable tape recorder settled on her lap.

REPORTER
Ann Daniel.  Gotham Tribune.

BRUCE
(reaching for door handle)
Bruce Wayne.  Nice to have met you.

He tries the door - there's another scream from the Female Crowd who
press around the car anticipating his exit.  Two ANGRY FEMINISTS raise
protesting placards threateningly as Bruce slams the door shut again.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
(at Alfred)
Go.

EXT. STREET - DAY

The Rolls lurches its way out of the Crowd into traffic.

INT. ROLLS - DAY

Bruce stares ahead in silence.  ANN studies him with a wry smile, then
pushes the ""record"" button on her machine.

BRUCE
Are you going to play some music?

ANN
You know what they say about Bruce
Wayne?
(no response)
That he's idle and jaded, with no
ambition left - because there's
nothing he hasn't done and been the
best at.

BRUCE
Sounds like a pretty boring guy.

ANN
What haven't you done, Mr. Wayne?
Cured cancer?  Climbed Everest?
(no response)
You climbed Everest?

Bruce smiles, reaches out, punches off the recorder.

ANN (CONT'D)
That's...not much of an exclusive.

BRUCE
What did you have in mind?

ANN
Something slightly more...in depth.

BRUCE
Sort of like - ""A Day in the Life
of Bruce Wayne?""

ANN
Exactly.  You just go ahead and do
whatever you'd be doing naturally -
only make me a part of it.

BRUCE
Miss Daniel - I'll do my level best
to accommodate you.

INT. ANN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA CLOSE on Ann's sleeping face as she lies naked in bed, her
features locked in a dreamy smile.  She sighs contentedly as HER OWN
VOICE IS HEARD from across the room.

ANN'S VOICE
...because there's nothing he hasn't
done and been the best at...

Bruce stands at the bedroom window, staring down absent-mindedly into
the street as he finishes dressing.  A LOUD CLAP OF THUNDER rolls
across the city.

BRUCE'S VOICE
(from tape)
Sounds like a pretty boring guy.

Bruce punches off the recorder, then presses ""rewind.""  He looks over
at Ann's sleeping body, then down at the recorder again.  He stops it,
then presses ""play.""

ANN'S VOICE
(from tape)
...he's idle and jaded with no ambi-
tion left...

Bruce smiles to himself bitterly, exits silently.

EXT. APARTMENT STREET - NIGHT

Bruce crosses the street to a gleaming Aston-Martin sportscar.  ANOTHER
THUNDER CLAP!  Rain falls as he reaches into the car, takes out a
topcoat and hat.  He starts to pull the convertible top up, glances
down the street:

PEOPLE scurry to avoid the rain.  Down the block, across the street, a
COUPLE with a YOUNG DAUGHTER look over nervously as a tough-looking
BIKER on a huge Harley-Davidson rolls up parallel to them on the
street.

BACK TO BRUCE

Adjusting the convertible top.  Looking off again.

BACK TO BRUCE'S P.O.V.

Suddenly:  the Biker hops the curb in front of the Family!  Pulling a
gun, he herds them back into a dark alleyway.

BACK TO BRUCE

Eyes narrowing.  His jaw twitches.  A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!  Bruce
explodes across the street for the alleyway.

As Bruce arrives:  the Young Girl bursts out screaming, runs past him.
Bruce hesitates, then runs inside the alley.

ANGLE IN ALLEYWAY

The Man lies in the alley, being cradled by the Woman.  Blood oozes
from the side of his head Bruce arrives.

WOMAN
I...think he'll be all right.  Our
daughter's run to call an ambulance.

Bruce hears the REVVING of a motorcycle.  He looks off down the alley,
eyes flashing with anger.

ANGLE DOWN ALLEY - HIS P.O.V.

The Biker grins at him from the far end of the alley, puts his Harley
in gear, rolls off through the pouring rain.

BACK TO BRUCE

He makes his decision, takes off in pursuit.

WOMAN
Careful!  He's got a gun!

EXT. END OF ALLEYWAY

Bruce arrives at the alley corner, looks off:

ANGLE ON BIKER - HIS P.O.V.

The Biker hovers by the side of an apartment building, still grinning
at Bruce through the rain.  He rolls forward slowly, almost as if
enticing Bruce to follow him, now disappears again.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce arrives at the rear of the building, which faces on a vacant dirt
lot.  He edges forward through the mud, turning the corner, suddenly
coming face to face with:

The Biker.  Still grinning.  Switching off his Harley.  Muscles bulging
through his wet T-shirt as he dismounts.

BIKER
Congratulations, man.
(wide smile)
You caught me.  Matter of fact...

The ROAR OF ENGINES is HEARD!  Bruce turns to see:  TWO MORE BIKERS,
rolling into position behind him.  Bruce is hopelessly trapped.

BIKER (CONT'D)
...you caught all of us...

The other two Bikers now dismount and close in.  The first Biker draws
his gun.  Biker #2 looks Bruce up and down critically, squinting at him
through the rain.

BIKER #2
That's my raincoat you're wearing.
Take it off.

Biker #2 snaps his arm forward - a switchblade appears in his hand.  He
flicks it at Bruce who stands his ground, slicing a button off the
front of his raincoat.

BIKER #2 (CONT'D)
Pick up the button, Wimpy.  Then
lick it clean and hand me my coat.

Bruce stares icily, then slowly bends down to retrieve the button from
the mud.  Suddenly:  Biker #1's foot flashes INTO FRAME, headed
straight at Bruce's face!  In a lightning-quick move, Bruce grabs the
swinging leg with both hands, rises, swings Biker #1 off the ground in
a circle, sends him crashing into the motorcycles as his gun goes
flying.

Biker #2, switchblade in hand, rushes Bruce.  Biker #3 unhooks chains
from his belt.  Bruce sidesteps:  the knife slashes through his
raincoat, sending it billowing out behind him like a cape!  Biker #3
whistles the chains past Bruce's ear:  He snatches them, karate-kicks
Biker #3 in the stomach, simultaneously belting Biker #2 across the
side of the head with the chains, knocking him unconscious.

Biker #3 lunges at Bruce from behind!  Bruce spins, grabbing his arm,
twisting the knife away, catching it in his other hand as he trips
Biker #3, sends him sprawling in the mud.  Bruce now straddles him,
knife in hand.

CLOSE ON BIKER #3

Blinking in fear, his head pressed into the mud next to the button.

BRUCE
Your turn to pick up the button,
scumbag...

Biker #3's arm slowly starts forward as Bruce steps on it.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
With your mouth.

Biker #3 shuts his eyes in humiliation as:  THE SOUND OF A SIREN IS
HEARD!

ANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING

TWO POLICEMEN round the corner of the apartment building, now stop,
stare in astonished silence at:

The Three Bikers, sprawled in the mud near their machines.  Bruce has
completely disappeared.

EXT. ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

A paramedic van is parked at the entrance.  Umbrella-holding ONLOOKERS
watch.  A gurney with the wounded Man is wheeled out.  The Woman and
the Young Girl follow.

Bruce appears at the edge of the crowd, collar still up, hat adjusted
low over his face  He stares.

The Paramedics stop.  One leans down, examines the Man, then covers his
face with the sheet.  The Woman turns away in silence.  The Young Girl
clings to her.

Bruce watches,  his eyes filled with tears.  He turns, walks off as
CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to the pouring rain.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

CAMERA RACKS BACK from the rain to Bruce, standing by the Aston-Martin
in front of Wayne Manor.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Bruce enters the empty living room.  His expression is numb.  He
pauses, lost in thought.  Then, moving as if by instinct, he heads for
the stairs leading to the basement.

INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Bruce descends the stairs, walks down the hallway to a door.  He stops,
looks down at the heavy padlock which seals it shut.  His eyes close in
pain, remembering an earlier time.

INT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - NIGHT

Seen through dim half-light:  his childhood lab is coated with dust - a
room obviously left unused for years.  We hear A KEY TURNING IN THE
LOCK.  The door to the lab swings open.  Bruce trains a flashlight on
the interior of the musty room.  He enters, finds a light switch, flips
it on.

The lab table is much as we remember it, crammed with old test tubes,
beakers, etc.  Bruce crosses, stares down, lost in his past, then
switches on the holograph machine.  He stares - stunned and amazed as:

THE HOLOGRAPH FIGURE OF TEN-YEAR-OLD BRUCE WAYNE SPRINGS TO LIFE!  An
exact visual reproduction of the Child who used to be.  The Young Boy
peers down through a cobwebbed microscope in precisely the position we
first saw him.

Bruce's eyes fill with tears - he shuts them tightly as he hears a
VOICE from long ago.

YOUNG BRUCE'S VOICE
It's called a holograph, Dad.
Pretty neat, huh?

One laser beam suddenly shorts out with age:  the image of Young Bruce
disappears.  The second beam continues to burn, its energy directed at
a disintegrating basement wall.

Bruce slumps at the other side of the table, oblivious, his face buried
in his hands.

OVERLAPPING IMAGES AND VOICE START TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

Martha Wayne			   - giggling with Young Bruce, then kissing
her husband passionately.

DR. WAYNE'S VOICE
This - is definitely not a guy.

Thomas Wayne			  - his face twisted in anguish as Chill's
bullet blows.

MARTHA'S VOICE
Oh, my God!  No!!

A SHARP CRACK!	    - As a piece of something crumbles away.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Looking up.  Staring across the room:

The remaining laser beam has eaten away a piece of the basement wall -
there is a dull ECHOING THUD as the plaster hits the bottom of some
unseen cavernous space below.

BACK TO BRUCE

Rising.  Crossing curiously to the hole in the wall.  Training his
flashlight torch through it.

ANGLE DOWN HOLE - HIS P.O.V.

AN IMMENSE CAVERN trails down and away into the blackness.  A network
of aged timbers intersect themselves, shoring up the side of the
foundation.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring.  Playing his flashlight against the visible parts of the
underground cavity.  He picks up a beaker from the lab table, then lets
it fall through the hole.  There is an interminable wait.  Finally -
the impact of SHATTERING GLASS.

ANGLE BACK THROUGH HOLE

Seen from inside:  the torch beam shines.  Suddenly - a long length of
rope is tossed through.  Bruce appears in the opening.  He wriggles
through, hanging on to the rope.

Bruce expertly shimmies down the rope, a man completely at home in an
action he knows well.  The beam from the torch dances across the walls
of the cavern:  high-ribbed, jagged walls, suggesting some sort of
labyrinth beyond.  The rope has played out.  Bruce hangs by the end,
looks down, lets himself fall to the cavern floor below.

He rises, plays the torch against the sides of the cave.

ANGLE ON BEAM - HIS P.O.V.

The beam searches into crannies, exploring dark gray walls.  It comes
across a large patch of solid black.

BACK TO BRUCE

Looking curiously.

BACK TO BLACK PATCH

As the beam hits the black patch fully - dozens of yellow eyes appear.
The entire mass LAUNCHES ITSELF INTO CAMERA with a terrifying screech
and the sound of beating wings.

BACK TO BRUCE

His jaw drops, stunned, as THE COLONY OF BATS swarm over him!  He
stumbles, protecting his face.  The torch drops to the floor.  Its
shaft of light dances crazily around the cavern.

From O.S. - a low moan is heard from Bruce.  It rises, gathers in
volume and intensity, gradually becoming a deep, booming guttural roar
- at once a scream of total pain and a cry of defiance.  The terrified
bats scream back in a maze of hot and cold light bouncing off beating
black wings.

INT. ALFRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The wind and rain batter against Alfred's partially open bedroom
window.  Mixed with the sounds - a strong echo of the roar from the
cavern.  Alfred's eyes pop open.  He rises groggily, makes his way to
the window, closes it.  CAMERA HOLDS on window, PANS UP to the moon.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - CLOSE ON MOON - NIGHT

A FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT:  CAMERA PANS DOWN from the moon through the
raging storm to the graves of Thomas and Martha Wayne in the country
cemetery, high on the hill.

Kneeling between them is Bruce - fists clenched, head bowed, tiny
rivulets of water running off his face and body - totally lost in
silent prayer.

BRUCE'S VOICE
I've worked hard to make you proud of
me.  To become the kind of person
whose presence could make a difference
in the world.  But one man can only do
only so much, Father.  Mother, to-
night I saw the sign I thought would
never come.  Now - for the first time
I realize I must...be...more...than
a man.

A FLASHING LIGHTNING BOLT WIPES THE SCREEN!

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

The remaining gossamer wisp of a transparent cloud pulls away from a
glowing FULL MOON over Gotham City.

INT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

An express train roars through a seedy subway station.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

A well-scrubbed TEENAGE COUPLE sit together holding hands.  The BOY is
dressed in a dinner jacket, the GIRL is a chiffon party dress with a
prominent orchid corsage pinned to it.  They exchange a nervous glance,
looking across the car at:

A TOUGH-LOOKING THUG who sits opposite them, his muscular arms bulging
through a torn windbreaker.  He grins across at the nervous Teenagers
menacingly, exposing yellow teeth, then sneaks a sideways look at:  A
THICKLY-BUILT TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE who stares straight ahead.

These are the only four people in the car.

The subway slows for the next stop.  The Truckdriver-Type rises
disinterestedly, crosses the car, looks down at the Teenagers who are
none too happy with his departure.

TRUCKDRIVER-TYPE
Have a nice time at the prom, kids?

BOY
Yes, thank you, Sir.

The subway doors hiss open.  The Truckdriver-Type smiles and exits.
The Teenagers looks across the car worried.

The car pulls out of the station.  The Thug rises, crosses the car,
grabs hold of a vertical pole to steady himself, smirks down at the
Teenagers.

THUG
You smell good enough to eat, Sweet-
heart.

BOY
(nervous bravado)
If you've got something to say,
Mister, talk to me, okay?

THUG
I was talking to you - Sweetheart.

A knife drops out of the Thug's sleeve into his hand, its razor-sharp
blade glinting in the light.  The Teenagers freeze with terror.

THUG (CONT'D)
Maybe it's that flower that smells
so good.

The Thug plucks the corsage off the trembling Girl's bodice, holds it
up to his nose, inhales deeply, shaking his head.

THUG (CONT'D)
Nope.  Still can't place it.

VOICE
Funny.  I can smell you from way
over here.

The Thug wheels, stares off at the end of the car, his jaw dropping
open.  The Teenagers' eyes bulge in disbelief.

CLOSE ON CHEST

A golden circle with the black figure of a bat sits in the middle of a
steel-gray skin-tight fabric stretched across a massively muscled
chest.

VOICE
Give the lady back her flower.

BACK TO SCENE

The Thug looks his unseen adversary up and down cautiously, unsure of
whether to laugh or obey.

THUG
Okay...sure.  Just wanted to have a
little fun.  I...

With a sudden lightning move he flips the switchblade in his hand,
sending it whizzing in the direction of the Voice.

CLOSE ON KNIFE

The knife whistles through the air TOWARD CAMERA.  Suddenly a black-
gloved hand miraculously snatches it out of mid-air, spinning it, then
sends it flying back!
The switchblade pierces the corsage, jerking it out of the Thug's hand,
sticking it into the wall where it quivers behind him.  The Thug
freezes, turning white.

VOICE
Now then.  I think you said you
wanted to have a little fun.

EXT. GOTHAM SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

The express wheezes to a stop at the next station.  A MIDDLE-AGED
COUPLE waits for the doors to open, then enter the car.  They suddenly
stop, staring in amazement:

The Thug stands spread-eagled in the middle of the car, both wrists
cuffed to overhanging metal handholds.  The center vertical pole
disappears up one pants leg, finally reappearing out of the collar of
his shirt.

The teenage Boy passes the amazed Couple, confidently dusting his
hands.  He reaches back for the Girl who sniffs her corsage, then
follows him out of the car.

EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Gotham Police Headquarters.  CAMERA TRACKS PAST cubicles and offices,
CLACKING, RINGING, DETECTIVES interrogating SUSPECTS, etc., catching up
with DAVID GORDON, the Commissioner of Police, a gruff-looking man in
his middle fifties who pauses to light a cheap cigarette.

Heading toward him from the other direction:  SERGEANT HALEY, a smooth-
faced kissass in his thirties.

GORDON
What's up Haley?

HALEY
Pretty slow, Commissioner.  Half a
dozen muggings, some kids on PCP,
and...oh, yeah.  Looks like we got a
transvestite prowling the southside
subway system.

GORDON
Full moon tonight.  Pervo heaven.

Gordon walks through his office door, Haley following.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The extremely cluttered office of an immensely overworked civil
servant.

HALEY
From his description, this guy could
make it as a float in the Rose
Parade.  Big black cape, black
boots, black hood over his head...

A squawk box intercom crackles on Gordon's desk.

INTERCOM VOICE
Hostage situation, Commissioner.
Man holding two women near 3rd and
Grand.  SWAT's on the way.

HALEY
...and get this - a big yellow moon
on his chest with a cockamamy bat in
the middle.

GORDON
(into intercom)
Get my car.  I'm going down there.

HALEY
Funny thing is, the guy takes on
this big goon with a knife...

GORDON
(chomping cigar)
You come along too, Haley.  I may need
to swap someone for those women.

EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY & STREET - NIGHT

Police cars barricade a major avenue, their spotlights trained on a
dead-end alley.  A SWAT LIEUTENANT speaks through a mike.

SWAT LT.
Come on out of there, Wells!  Come
out of we're coming in after you!

WELLS' VOICE
I got hostages!  You get one minute
to clear out or I blow'em away!

From behind:  Commissioner Gordon's car screeches to a stop.  Gordon
piles out, followed by Haley.

GORDON
How bad is it, Lieutenant?

SWAT LT.
We're screwed, Sir.  That's a dead-
end alley in there.  No way to get
behind him.

EXT. DEAD-END ALLEY

A pockmarked thug (WELLS) holds one YOUNG WOMAN roughly, trains his gun
on ANOTHER.  He squints out into the light.

WELLS
Thirty seconds, Pig!  Then I spill
one lady's brains on the street!
Twenty-five...

CAMERA PANS DOWN to the pavement behind Wells.

WELLS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Twenty!...

A manhole cover rises, moves aside silently.

WELLS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Fifteen!...

BACK TO WELLS

WELLS (CONT'D)
Ten!...

WOMAN
No!  Please!

Wells cocks the gun, sticks it at her head.

WELLS
Five!  Four!...

VOICE
Three...two...one...

Wells spins in astonishment:

An ominous hulking shadow looms in the darkness behind him.  TWO
PULSATING YELLOW EYES pierce through the blackness.

VOICE
I just counted you out, Wells.

Wells fires!  The Shadow swings the manhole cover up as the bullet
ricochets off it harmlessly.  Wells prepares to fire again.  The
manhole cover suddenly explodes out of the darkness!  One swing of a
massively muscled arm - one sickening ""clang"" - and it's over.

ANGLE ON STREET

SWAT LT.
Let's go!

The Police rush toward the alley, Gordon and Haley bringing up the
rear, as the two Women emerge.

WOMAN
WOMAN #2
He saved us!  A giant black							   Eight
fee tall!								   monster from the
sewers!

The Police storm into the alley as Gordon and Haley comfort the panting
Women.

WOMAN
WOMAN #3					    He had black wings...
And...and yellow eyes...

GORDON
Well, of course he did...You can
both calm down now, ladies.  The
nightmare's over...

WOMAN
Huge arms...thick black gloves...

HALEY
(suddenly)
With a bright yellow moon on his
chest?

WOMAN #2
That's right...

HALEY
And a black bat flying right in the
middle of it!

WOMAN
That's right!

The Women are led away by Paramedics.  Haley cocks his head
questioningly at Gordon as they proceed into the alley.

GORDON
Forget it.  That airhead from the
subway could never have made it to
the north side of town this fast.

HALEY
Maybe there's more than one of them.
Maybe we're dealing with some sort
of secret society of cross-dressers.

Wells is led past them, still groggy, as they arrive at the open
manhole and peer down into the forbidding blackness.

GORDON
Get after him, Haley.

HALEY
(gulping)
Me, Sir?

GORDON
Well, you're the only one with an
accurate description!

Haley reluctantly lowers himself into the open manhole as Gordon turns,
yells down the alleyway.

GORDON (CONT'D)
Comb the area!  I want every squad
car available!  We're looking for
the mother of all psychos in a party
costume!

Gordon turns back, looks down into the empty manhole where Haley has
now disappeared.

HALEY'S VOICE
(from manhole)
You don't think he...bites, do you,
Sir?

EXT. GOTHAM APARTMENT HOUSE - HIGH SHOT - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the roof of a Gotham skyscraper at the windows
of a forty-story apartment house below.

CAMERA HOLDS on a pair of glass doors leading out to a rosetta-carved
stone balcony.  Clearly visible through the doors:  AN ELDERLY COUPLE
lie face down on the floor of their living room, guarded by a masked
BURGLAR holding a shotgun.  ANOTHER BURGLAR has managed to open a wall
safe and begins stuffing valuables into a gunny sack.

CAMERA ZOOMS BACK!

We are some thirty stories higher across a wide avenue.

A black-gloved hand ENTERS FRAME, holding a thin, clear nylon cord with
a tiny barbed fishhook on the end.

The other gloved hand steadies a gleaming titanium rifle barrel with an
infrared scope.  The fishhook is threaded through the chamber.

A flap is opened in a thick, compartmentalized black belt.  The
moonlight glints off a cylindrical silver gas cartridge.

ANGLE ACROSS STREET THROUGH SCOPE

Seen through the magnified infrared scope:  the cross hairs of the
rifle sight settle in on the head of the Burglar holding the shotgun.

The cross hairs pause - then suddenly lower to the balcony.  The rifle
FIRES with an audible ""hiss"" of compressed gas.

ANGLE ON ROSETTA BALCONY

As the fishhook whistles through a hole in the rosetta stone framework
of the balcony.  On impact with the floor it pops open - expanding to
ten times its size, having now become an effective grappling hook.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Burglar with the shotgun turns at the muffled metallic NOISE, looks
through the glass doors at the empty balcony.

EXT. BALCONY FLOOR

The grappling hook inches across the balcony floor, catching a firm
hold against the stone.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOF - NIGHT

The nylon cord has been pulled taut - it disappears down into the
blackness at a dizzying height, some four hundred feet above the avenue
and crisscrossing traffic lights below.

Black-gloved hands take hold of the cord, testing it.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

An ominous BLACK SHADOW, cape billowing out behind in an eerie
silhouette, passes in front of the glowing yellow ball of the full
moon.

ANGLE DOWN CORD AT BALCONY

The balcony and double glass doors WHISTLE UP AT CAMERA at a dizzying
speed, growing larger by the millisecond!

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Burglar has finished his work at the safe.  He nods to the other
Burglar who grins, then cocks his shotgun, pointing it down at the
helpless Couple on the floor.

The flicker of an outside SHADOW flits across the room - the Burglar
blinks, wheels with his shotgun!

Suddenly:  the double doors explode with a hail of shattering glass!
Almost simultaneously - the shotgun FIRES!

INT. GORDON'S CAR - NIGHT

A surly Gordon looks over as his intercom crackles.

INTERCOM VOICE
Commissioner, this is Sergeant
Havemeyer.  I'm on the fortieth
floor of the Gotham Arms.  Our boy
has struck again.  Cape, boots, hood
-- the whole drill.

GORDON
(snatches intercom)
When?

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Just now.  The owners tripped a
silent alarm.  We responded and
heard a gunshot as we were running
down the hallway.  The victims are
fine.  Sonofabitch cold-cocked both
perpetrators.

GORDON
Atta boy, Havemeyer.  Hold him for
questioning till I get there.

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Can't do that, Sir.  He's...already
left.

GORDON
But you were right outside the door...

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
He left...by the window, Sir.

GORDON
By the window?  Goddamnit, Man,
you're on the fortieth floor!

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
That's...affirmative, Sir.

GORDON
You get back to headquarters pronto,
Mister!  I want your urine checked
for drugs!

HAVEMEYER'S VOICE
Yes, Sir.

Gordon slams down the intercom in disgust.

GORDON
Maybe it's something in the water.
Maybe the whole city's on drugs.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

Police SIRENS everywhere.  A squad car rolls slowly down the street,
its spotlight searching the doorways and alleys.

INT. SQUAD CAR - NIGHT

The COP DRIVER yawns, turns to his PARTNER who works the spotlight, now
notices something.

COP DRIVER
What's that?

PARTNER
Wino...
(out the window)
Go back to sleep, Ace!

Suddenly:  A WHISTLING SOUND through the air!  The two Cops blink, snap
their heads forward as the searchlight is trained on:

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR  P.O.V.

THE BATMAN! - Seen in his majestic totality for the very first time.  A
truly awesome figure from his black cowl to his gleaming black boots.
His huge, dark cape billows out ominously behind him.

BACK TO SQUAD CAR

COP DRIVER
Holee shit...

PARTNER
Let's get him!

BACK TO SCENE

The squad car lurches forward!  Batman whirls, runs down an alley.  The
squad car swings, pulls in after him.

INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Batman runs with the speed of an Olympic sprinter, but the squad car
gains rapidly.  He looks over his shoulder.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR - HIS P.O.V.

The squad car fills the alleyway.

BACK TO BATMAN

He looks in front of him in horror - another squad car speed at him
from the other direction.  It too fills the alleyway.  There's no place
to hide.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #1

Filling frame - the Cops grinning.

ANGLE ON SQUAD CAR #2

Filling frame - the Cops grinning.

BACK TO BATMAN

He stands his ground.  Then - curiously - runs directly at the first
squad car.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SQUAD CAR #1

COP #1
What the...?

BACK TO BATMAN - SLOW MOTION SHOT

With a perfectly timed leap, Batman vaults onto the hood of the car in
a somersault and does a complete 360 - up the windshield - over the
roof - off the trunk - lands on the pavement with the grave of a cat.

ANGLE ON TWO POLICE CARS

They crash head-on with a sickening sound of crunching metal and flying
glass.  Two groggy Police exit, front doors falling off, try to clear
their heads.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAWN

The first orange rays of the morning sun stab upwards through the
clouds over Wayne Manor.

INT. YOUNG BRUCE'S LAB - DAY

Young Bruce Wayne's lab room remains much as we remember it, except
that the gaping hole in the wall caused by the laser has been
reinforced and shaped into a doorway.  A make-shift ladder-like
stairway leads down into the cavern below.

FOOTSTEPS are heard climbing the ladder from deep within the cave.
After a moment, Bruce appears, stripped to the waist, still wearing his
utility belt and the bottom half of his Batman suit.  His chest and
stomach are nicked with small cuts and bruises from his previous
night's work.  His forehead glistens with sweat born of utter
exhaustion.  He sits heavily on a cot, buries his face in his hands,
looks up suddenly as the door to the lab opens.

Alfred enters, stares silently, first appalled by Bruce's physical
condition, then shaking his head with sympathy.  Bruce stares back,
eyes heavy with lack of sleep.

BRUCE
You...think I'm crazy, don't you?
Certifiably insane.

ALFRED
(pause; smile)
A bit...eccentric, perhaps.

BRUCE
It's...what I have to do, Alfred.
After all those years of searching
-- it was always what I had to do.

ALFRED
If I may be permitted, Sir...
(with difficulty)
I've...never had any children of my
own.  Never saw the advantage in it,
considering my profession.  I've
always thought myself more talented
at raising flowers than people...

Bruce looks up with a warm smile of gratitude.

ALFRED
Oh, I didn't raise you, Sir, I
simply watched you grow.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

A Banner edition of the Gotham Tribune cartwheels INTO FRAME:  On the
front page:  fanciful artist's renditions drawn from eyewitness
recollections of the Batman.

One is of a menacing black vampire with long, pointed fangs.  Another
show a dark, furry giant with huge feathered wings.  Above them the
headline:  BAT-MAN INVADES CITY.  MASS HYSTERIA GRIPS GOTHAM.  POLICE
NO MATCH FOR WINGED INTRUDER.

CAMER HOLDS on the newspaper as we hear the jumbled and excited VOICES
of REPORTERS underneath:

REPORTER'S VOICE
Commissioner, how do you explain this
Fantastic phenomenon?

GORDON'S VOICE
I can't explain it.  I only hope for the
poor fellow's sake, he's sobered up by now.

EXT. GOTHAM COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

Bruce lies on a deck chair by the swimming pool of the Gotham Country
Club, his body coated with sun oil.  He listens to Gordon's TV press
conference on a tiny transistor set next to him.  His eyes flutter open
with amusement.

TV REPORTER
Well considering the fact he apprehended
four criminals last night, shouldn't we
be calling him...a good Samaritan?

GORDON
Sure.  If you feel like calling John
Hinkley a political activist.

Bruce's eyes suddenly bulge wider.  He gazes across the swimming pool,
transfixed by what he sees.

ANGLE ON SILVER - BRUCE'S P.O.V.

A stunning-looking woman (SILVER ST. CLOUD) steps out onto the high
board of the pool, dressed in a daringly-cut shiny white latex tank
suit.  A shining mane of glistening silver hair cascades down across
her shoulders.  She pauses, a shimmering white diamond in the sun.

REPORTER'S VOICE
Commissioner, it might surprise you
to know that several polls taken
today show more than eighty percent
of those interviewed approve of
this...vigilante and what he did...

Silver glances over in Bruce's direction.  Curiously enough, she seems
to smile at him and wave.

GORDON'S VOICE
Well I can't account for public
taste, bit I'd like to warn any
potential copy cats who may be out
there that...

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce is stunned and confused, but starts to lift his hand to wave back
when:

THORNE'S VOICE
If brains were bodies, she'd look
just the same.  Can you believe it?

Bruce swivels, lowering his hand.  Thorne stands behind him, waves back
at Silver who executes a complicated but perfect dive into the pool.
She starts to swim across in their direction as Throne grins down at
Bruce.

THORNE
Name's Silver St. Cloud.  Phi Beta
Kappa, Masters Degree in Political
Science.  Just arrived in Gotham to
finish her doctorate on municipal
government and guess which City
councilman drew her as an intern?

BRUCE
(staring)
Taught her much so far?

THORNE
(chuckle)
Not as much as I plan to.

Silver reaches the edge of the pool.  Thorne starts to help her out as
Bruce continues to start.

SILVER
The water's glorious, Rupert.  Come
on in.

THORNE
Never had time to learn how to swim.
Too busy trying to make a living, I
guess.  Not like Mr. Wayne over
here...
(chuckle)
Right, Bruce?
(turns)
Silver St. Cloud - Bruce Wayne.

Bruce looks up, totally mesmerized by the sight of her.  She gazes down
with a devastating smile, the sun sparkling off the beads of water on
her face.  She is instantly and equally smitten as they lock eyes.

SILVER
Please don't get up.

BRUCE
(lost)
Hmm?

SILVER
I said - please don't get up.

BRUCE
Oh.
(starts to get up)
Sorry...

SILVER
That's all right.  I asked you not
to, remember?

BRUCE
(stops)
So you did.  Thanks.

SILVER
Don't mention it.

Rupert watches them watching each other.  The uncomfortable silence is
filled by Gordon's VOICE from the television.

GORDON'S VOICE
And now, if there are no other ques-
tions, it's my birthday tonight and
I have a formal party to get ready
for...

Thorne reaches down, turns off the TV in disgust.

THORNE
That clown has been a disgrace to
law enforcement his entire career.
This city's going to hell in a hand-
basket and some imbecile's giving
him a formal birthday party.

BRUCE
It should be fun.  I'm giving it.

Thorne raises his eyebrows.  Silver still stares.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Perhaps the two of you would like to
come?

THORNE
SILVER
I'm busy, thanks.									   I'd
love to.

THORNE
(irritated)
Silver, I don't think...ah...

SILVER
If I'm not being too inquisitive,
Mr. Wayne - exactly what is it you
do?

BRUCE
Do?

SILVER
For a living?

THORNE
(chuckles)
You're looking at it.

BRUCE
Actually, Rupert's not being
entirely fair about his...
(nice smile)
Sometimes I go hang gliding.

SILVER
And that's it?

BRUCE
Not quite.

SILVER
I didn't think so.

BRUCE
I have a dog as well.

Silver manages a tiny, unsure smile.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Wayne Manor.  Eight o'clock.  I'll
have my car pick you up.

THORNE
Why don't you take my car, Silver?
In case you want to leave early.

SILVER
I'm very flattered by the dueling
limos, gentlemen, but I can grab a
cab, thanks.
(nods)
Mr. Wayne...

Silver excuses herself.  Both men watch her departure avidly.

THORNE
Gotham City's no place for a beauti-
ful woman to be travelling alone.
I'm holding you personally responsi-
ble for her safety, Wayne.

BRUCE
Don't worry, Rupert.  I'll treat her
just as if I were in love with her
instead of you.

Thorne's eyes narrow.  Bruce smiles ingenuously.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Dozens of expensive cars disgorge their passengers in front of stately
Wayne Manor.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A lavish party is in progress.  A DANCE BAND plays off to the side,
under a banner reading ""Happy Birthday to the Finest of Gotham's
Finest.""

Bruce Wayne greets his arriving GUESTS, his neck craning around in vain
for a sight of Silver.

Gordon stands by the bar, downs a double scotch, scowls at GUESTS who
talks animatedly to him while flapping his arms like wings - doing a
crude imitation of the Batman.  The Guest howls with laughter, moves
off as Gordon orders another drink and Bruce joins him with a
sympathetic smile.

BRUCE
They're giving you a pretty hard time
about that Batman, aren't they...

Gordon nods, tosses back his drink angrily.

GORDON
I'd give up half my pension to be
standing face to face with that
caped fruitcake right now.
(looks off; stares)
Now there's a sight to make an old
man's eyes water.

Silver St. Cloud approaches them, threading her way through the
appreciative glances of the Guests, dressed in a sparkling, metallic
evening gown, the light bouncing off it like tiny bursts of shooting
stars.  She reaches Bruce, extends her hand with a warm smile.

SILVER
I hope I'm not too late.

GORDON
In my case, by twenty years.

BRUCE
Silver, St. Cloud - this is David
Gordon, Commissioner of Police.
Miss St. Cloud is picking up the
finer points of the city government from
Councilman Thorne.

SILVER
My ambition is to hold a job as
important as yours one day, Commis-
sioner.

GORDON
Then you and Mr. Thorne already have
much in common.

SILVER
(suddenly)
Would you care to dance, Mr. Wayne?

BRUCE
(locking eyes)
You're as clairvoyant as you are
beautiful, Miss St. Cloud.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Now heading into the driveway is a brightly painted version of an old-
time twenties paddy wagon, with two look-alikes of the old KEYSTONE
KOPS riding on top.  They honk a comical horn loudly as laughing
PARKING ATTENDANTS greet them

INT. WAYNE MANOR - ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR

Bruce and Silver glide smoothly across the floor - a perfect fit.
Bruce looks down curiously.

SILVER
Something wrong?

BRUCE
You're...leading.

SILVER
I asked you, remember?

Alfred arrives, interrupting them.

ALFRED
Excuse me, Sir, but there are some
oddly dressed gentlemen outside with a
singing telegram for the Commissioner.

BRUCE
Ask them to come in, will you,
Alfred?

Bruce makes his way to the bandstand, whispers some instructions to the
BANDLEADER.  A LOUD FANFARE is played.  All conversation stops as the
front door opens.

Now entering Wayne Manor:  the Two Keystone Kops, in their twenties'
costumes with handlebar moustaches.  They dance their way to the center
of the room in a prearranged routine, singing in harmony from Pirates
of Penzance.

KOPS
When a felon's not engaged in his
employment,
Or maturing his felonious little
plans,
His capacity for innocent enjoyment
Is just as great as any honest
man's...
Oh, a policeman's lot is not a happy
one...

The Guests applaud loudly.  Gordon joins Bruce and Silver as the Kops
break into a vaudeville routine.

KOP
Excuse me, Sir.  Have you seen a
policeman around here?

KOP #2
Why no, I haven't.

KOP
(drawing gun)
Good.  Then give me your watch.

Several Guests laugh.  Bruce winces at the bad joke.

KOP #2
But this watch isn't worth anything.
It only has a sentimental value.

KOP
Well give it to me anyway.  I feel
like a good cry.

Gordon laughs loudly as the Kop turns to him.

KOP (CONT'D)
Now, Commissioner, if we could
borrow your watch for a moment...

GORDON
(taking it off)
Sure.  Be careful with it, okay?

The Kop smiles, takes the watch, dangles it from his hand.  Kop #2
silently sidles in behind Bruce and Silver.

KOP
Here's a good one:  what's a police-
man's favorite way to kill time?

GORDON
(grinning)
I'll bite.  What is a policeman's
favorite way to kill time?

The Kop grins, pull his gun - FIRES!  Gordon's watch is smashed to
smithereens.  Kop #2's gun suddenly at the back of Silver's head,
hammer cocked.

KOP #2
Up against the wall, everybody!
Move!!

The Guests scream as six more Kops burst through the front door
carrying automatic weapons.  Bruce, Silver, and Gordon are herded back
against the wall with the others.

The KOP grins, then suddenly starts to giggle insanely.  He takes off
his helmet, as a shock of GREEN HAIR is exposed!  He wipes his lips
clean which now become ruby red.  Cackling in glee, THE JOKER faces his
victims, his gaze suddenly becoming cruel and cold.

JOKER
One at a time, your money and your
jewels, and no one's head'll wind
up looking like the Commissioner's
watch, capisce?

KOP #3
Hey, boss!  Look!

The Joker turns.  Kop #3 and a PARTNER have set Gordon's huge birthday
cake on the floor, now wade through it, stomping up and down, kicking
the insides across the room.

KOP #3
We're doing the cake walk!

The Joker giggles, then shoots a satanically maniacal look at the
Guests who instantly begin stripping off their jewelry, taking out
wallets, etc. as more Kops pass by with a gunny sack.  The Joker walks
down the line, stopping to level a searching and curious gaze into the
eyes of:

Bruce Wayne, between Gordon and Silver, his face set, eyes steely,
staring at the Joker.  His jaw twitches.

Silver watches him, noticing the twitch.  She gives him a tiny,
sympathetic smile, then turns to face:

Kop #2, who has moved down the line to Silver.  He looks her up and
down hungrily as she stares back in defiance.  His fingers slowly reach
up to grip her necklace, then linger.

KOP #2
In your case, lady, I'd like to
rip the rest off and leave this on.

Suddenly:  BRUCE'S FIST FLASHES INTO FRAME!  Kop #2 is knocked backward
through the air as another Kop lunges at Bruce who grabs the gunny sack
filled with jewelry and bashes him in the face!  The Kop crumples to
the floor as Bruce wheels to face the Joker and sees:

The Joker, grinning cruelly, the barrel of his gun pressing up under
Silver's chin.  Her eyes are welded shut with fear.

JOKER
Now that was extremely bad manners,
Mr. Wayne.  Especially from someone...
(gestures)
...to the Manor born...
(giggles)
So why don't you rejoin the lady here,
or if you like...
(cocks gun; glowers)
I can send part of her over to you.

Bruce hesitates, then rejoins the line.  The Joker lowers his gun,
turns to stare at a painting on the wall as a Kop holds out the open
gunny sack to Gordon.

GORDON
(to Joker)
I'll see you rot in the gas chamber
for this.

The Joker smiles, ignoring him, looking at the portrait painting which
is of a distinguished older man.  He removes it from the wall.  An
indignant Alfred speaks up from farther down the line of Guests.

ALFRED
Be careful, you clot!  That portrait
goes back to Mr. Wayne's grandfather!

JOKER
Why?  Is there something wrong with
it?

The Joker cackles, punching the painting out of its frame.

CLOSE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

Bruce stares silently.  His jaw twitches with anger born of
humiliation.  Silver notices again.

SILVER
(whisper)
Look on the bright side.  You're
adorable when your jaw twitches.

BACK TO SCENE

The Joker crosses to Gordon with the empty picture frame.  Another Kop
points a camera as the Joker holds the frame up to encircle his and
Gordon's face.

JOKER
(giggling)
I've always wanted to frame a Police
Commissioner...

CLOSE ON JOKER'S AND GORDON'S FACES

Gordon shuts his eyes in disgrace.  The Joker howls with glee.

THE FLASHBULB STROBE WIPES THE SCEEN!

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The Kops exit Wayne Manor with their loot, climb back into the paddy
wagon, roar out of the driveway.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The terrified and disgruntled Guests head for the door as Bruce and
Silver look over at a devastated Gordon.

BRUCE
I'm afraid the tabloids are going
to have a field day with this, David.
Not to mention Rupert Thorne.

ALFRED
(joining them)
I tried calling the police.  The
phone line seems to have been cut.

GORDON
I'll report it myself, Alfred.
Right before I cut my throat.

He tries to check his watch, stares at an empty wrist, sighs, then
joins the stream of departing Guests as Bruce looks over at Silver
glumly.

BRUCE
Well.  Good-night.  I guess...

SILVER
(sudden grin)
Why don't be silly.  I've only just
arrived.

BRUCE
(smile)
Would you care to dance, Miss St. Cloud?

SILVER
(offering her arm)
You're as clairvoyant as you are
gallant, Mr. Wayne...

EXT. GOTHAM POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

A crestfallen Gordon exits his car in front of Police Headquarters.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Gordon walks slowly and dejectedly down the nearly deserted hallway.
As he passes one DETECTIVE'S cubicle, the sound of SNICKERING is HEARD
from inside.

Gordon stops defiantly.  The snickering instantly dies away.  Muttering
disgustedly, Gordon enters his office.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office is lit only be a small desk lamp.  Strung up behind the desk
is a crudely-made banner reading:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUT COMMISH - FROM
ALL YOUR BOYS IN BLUE.

Gordon shakes his head sadly, crosses to a cabinet, pours himself an
enormous glass of Scotch, then crosses with the bottle to the open
office window.  He takes a long swig, exhales, then slams the window
shut.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The Wayne Manor driveway is deserted under the moonlight.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

The band plays a soft, dreamy number as Bruce and Silver dance together
dreamily, locked in each other's arm, drifting silently through the
vast living room.

CLOSER ON THEM

Silver's eyes flutter open, then lock into his.

SILVER
Maybe you'd better take me home...

BRUCE
I am home...

SILVER
(soft murmur)
You see...I don't do anything on
the first date...

BRUCE
Don't be so hard on yourself...You're
doing just fine...

He draws her in more tightly as hey glide across the floor.

EXT. SILVER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

Bruce's Aston-Martin is parked in front of an unassuming apartment
house in middle-class Gotham.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

Bruce escorts Silver down the modest, clean hallway.

SILVER
Thank you for a totally unexpected
evening, Bruce.  I like surprises...

She stops at a door, inserts her key, turns, smiles.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Including you.

BRUCE
Oh?  How did...
(smile)
Rupert Thorne describe me?

SILVER
As a rather ineffectual playboy.
But pleasant enough in a harmless
sort of way.

BRUCE
Like an affable grasshopper bouncing
around in the middle of all you
hard-working ants...

SILVER
Something like that.

Bruce takes her hand gently, stares deeply into her eyes.

BRUCE
And you?  How would you describe me?

SILVER
(staring back)
I don't think you're harmless.  And
I don't think anyone who's looked
straight in your eyes could say so.

Bruce's jaw twitches involuntarily.  Silver grins.  He leans in, kisses
her lingeringly on the mouth.  They break.  He gazes into her
disoriented eyes.

BRUCE
Frightened?

SILVER
Terrified...but don't worry...
(soft smile)
As a kid they always had to drag me
off the roller coaster.

They kiss again, passionately.  She looks up, confused.

SILVER (CONT'D)
I sleep I'll get some think now...

She turns key, slips through the door, closing it again.

Bruce sigh, slumps back heavily against the wall, realizing a dilemma
he may never be able to solve.

EXT. GOTHAM SKYLINE - NIGHT

The yellow moon glows brightly over Gotham City.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gordon is slumped over his desk, mumbling to himself in a half-drunken
stupor.  The bottle of Scotch next to him has clearly been emptied.

Suddenly - a gust of cold wind ruffles his hair.  His eyes flutter,
then look over at the open office window.

GORDON
Thought I closed that Goddamn thing...

He staggers to the window, looks out sadly.

BATMAN'S VOICE
Whatever you do - don't jump.

Gordon whirls.  Batman looms up from a dark corner.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
We've been at odds, Commissioner,
and it's Gotham's loss.  My fight
isn't with you.  It's with the dis-
eased scum infesting this city.

Gordon backs up toward his desk, smiles nervously.

GORDON
Of course it is...

BATMAN
Criminals are a cowardly lot at heart.
But human garbage like the Joker is
taking over Gotham - in spite of
everything that you and other men of
good will can do about it.

GORDON
Don't you preach law and order to
me, you...

BATMAN
The people need a symbol.  Someone
to rally around.  Someone who isn't
hamstrung by the very laws he's
sworn to uphold, whose hands aren't
tied with red tape.  They have a
right to justice.

GORDON
That I happen to agree with...
(pulls gun from
drawer)
That's why you're under arrest.

Gordon levels the gun.  They are frozen for a moment.  Batman advances
slowly.  He speaks in measured tones, eyes clear, voice almost
hypnotic.

BATMAN
You won't pull that trigger because
you realize I'm your last chance.
You're fighting a war you've already
lost and you know it.

Batman stands inches away from the gun barrel now.  Gordon peers deeply
into his eyes through the cowl.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
With your blessing - with you
cooperation - together we could rid
the streets of Gotham of violence
and corruption.

Gordon blinks.  His gun hand wavers.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
We share the same dream, Gordon.
You know we do.  Trust you
intuition.  Join me.

Batman extends a black-gloved hand.

CLOSE ON HAND

The hand holds steady, the gun pointed directly at it.

BACK TO THEM

The Caped Crusader's gaze rivets Gordon to the spot.

BACK TO HANDS

A beat.  Gordon's gun drops to the floor.  His hand grasps the black
glove tightly.

EXT. GOTHAM POLICE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

CAMERA ZOOMS up the building, WHIPPING INTO the night sky:

Seen for the first time:  THE GLOWING BATSIGNAL!  The silhouetted
yellow ball knifes up through the night over Gotham, seeming to glow
more brightly than the moon!

Underneath, WE HEAR a cacophony of REPORTERS' VOICES:

Gotham Eyewitness News.				    Ten.  The Black Knight

REPORTER #3
The Joker's gang was in for a rude
awakening early this morning when...

CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM the night sky to:

EXT. GIRDER BUILDING - NIGHT

We are on top of a partially constructed building - a maze of
interconnecting steel girders, jutting out over the black waters of
Gotham River.

A WIRY, WEASEL-FACED MAN (JIMMY MALONE) stands on a top girder some
forty floors above the water, seems to be aiming his gun into the
blackness.

MALONE
Stay away from me!

EXT. GIRDERS - NIGHT

Malone trembles,  squints into the dark, hears A VOICE:

BATMAN'S VOICE
I think we've run out of floors.

A black cape swirls around the side of a girder.  Malone panics,
squeezes the trigger RAPID FIRE!  Then - silence.

BATMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Floors - and bullets.

Now stepping out onto the girder, emerging from the blackness:  THE
BATMAN!  His huge black cape billows out ominously.

ANGLE ON GORDON

Gordon, Haley, and a mob of Reporters watch tensely from below where a
gang of handcuffed Crooks is being led off by the police.

BACK TO GIRDERS

Malone inches back on the uppermost girder which juts out over the
river.  He clicks his gun - empty - throws it at the Batman, missing
him.  The Batman advances coldly.

BATMAN
They say a cornered rat can be dan-
gerous.  You don't look so tough.

As Batman advances, suddenly:  HIS FOOT SLIPS!  He tumbles over the
side of the girder, hangs on, his fingers jammed into the rivet holes!

ANGLE ON BELOW

An audible GASP from the assembled audience.

BACK TO BATMAN

Straining to hold on, his fingers almost coming out of their sockets.
He looks down:  the network of girders dissolves dizzyingly into black.

Malone starts forward, grinning broadly.

MALONE
Here.  Lemme give you a hand...

Malone claps loudly.  Batman winces, hangs on.

MALONE (CONT'D)
Now a foot...

Malone brings one show down hard on Batman's hand, grinds it in.  Then,
the other foot on the remaining hand.  Batman grimaces in unbelievable
pain.

Suddenly:  Batman swings his leg back!  He bursts forward again in an
arc, propelling his feet under the girder and up again around the other
side.  His boots crash into the back of Malone's legs - launching him
out into space with an agonizing scream!

The Batman stands on the girder, looking down.  He gives a tiny salute,
then DIVES OUT INTO THE NIGHT!  Sailing down through the blackness for
more than a hundred feet, he hits the river with an enormous splash,
then disappears.

BACK TO GORDON

Gordon watches, stunned, as a Reporter comes up.

REPORTER
Incredible!  Who is he, Commis-
sioner?  Can you let us in on it?

GORDON
(suddenly crafty)
Id like to, but...I'm afraid that
information's classified.

The Reporter walks off, muttering angrily.  Haley looks sideways at
Gordon in disbelief.

GORDON
(exploding)
Goddamnit, Haley, do I have to tell
you every little thing?

INT. RUPERT THORNE'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA PANS DOWN from the Gotham City logo:  TRUTH, JUSTICE, INTERGRITY
to the face of Rupert Thorne, a cigar wedged between gritted teeth,
watching a TV across the room.

TV REPORTER'S VOICE
...reporting live from the Gotham
Museum where Batman has caught the
Penny Plunderers.  Criminals are
Rapidly becoming an endangered
Species here in Gotham, thanks to...

There is a KNOCK.  The door opens.  Silver enters with some papers for
Thorne, pauses to look at the set.

SILVER
That Batman's something, isn't he?
(hands over papers)
For once in our lives, a real,
honest-to-God hero.

THORNE
(forced smile)
Oh, he's some piece of work, all
right...

Thorne takes the papers.  Silver exits as he glares back at the set
from which we now HEAR BATMAN'S VOICE.

BATMAN'S VOICE
...but the credit really belongs
to the citizens of this city and
their elected officials, who've bent
over backwards...

THORNE
(chomping cigar)
Then kiss my ass.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

THE YELLOW BATSIGNAL explodes up into the night sky!

EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT

A dirty, stained tramp steamer lies at anchor in Gotham Harbor.  A
POCK-MARKED CAPTAIN whispers down to TWO CONFEDERATES in a dinghy
below.

CAPTAIN
You can tell the Joker his drugs are
on their way.  Now get the hell out
of here.

The dinghy putts off into the night.  The Captain turns.

CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
Weigh anchor!

ANGLE ON SIDE OF SHIP

The huge anchor chain rumbles up the side of the ship's prow.  Now
emerging from UNDER THE WATER - THE BATMAN!  He rides the anchor chain
up toward the deck.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Silver peddles away on an exercycle in her apartment, dressed in a
nightie, avidly watching the Late News.

TV REPORTER
...the biggest drug bust in the
history of Gotham City!  Where will
The Dark Avenger appear next?  Who
knows?  Maybe everywhere!

SILVER
(churning away)
My door's unlocked, you big hunk...

EXT. FLAMING BUILDING - NIGHT

A TOWERING INFERNO engulfs a building in a poor section of town.
Flames shoot out of the upper floors as a DISTRAUGHT MOTHER pleads with
the FIREMEN.

MOTHER
But my baby!  My baby's still in
there!

FIRE CAPTAIN
It's impossible, lady!  I can't send
My men into that tinderbox!

FIREMAN
(staring up in awe)
Look!!

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR P.O.V.

The Batman lands on top of the burning building!  Hooking his nylon
cord securely, he shields his face with his cape, then launches himself
downwards, swinging straight through a window in a SHOWER OF GLASS AND
FLAMES!

After an agonizing moment - he reappears!  He cradles a BAWLING BABY in
his arms, covers it with his cape, then quickly shimmies down into the
street.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - DAY

The Joker paces angrily as the TV blares:

TV REPORTER'S VOICE
...here at Gotham Amusement Park
where - if you can believe it -
the Batman has subdued a mechanical
dinosaur, thus foiling the Joker's
plot to...

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Once again:  THE GLOWING BATSIGNAL whips up into the night!

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

TWO CROOKS run across a rooftop, carrying a bag of loot, heading for a
helicopter which waits, blades whirring.  They reach the chopper, look
behind them as:

ANGLE ON BATMAN - THEIR P.O.V.

The Batman lands on the opposite side of the roof, some twenty yards
away.

CROOK #1
(looking back)
Sorry, Batman.  Gotta fly now...

The Crooks pile into the helicopter, laughing loudly.  It starts to
take off, rising quickly.

BACK TO BATMAN

His jaw twitches.  He unhooks the BATARANG from the front of his
utility belt.  (NOTE:  This is a black, bat-shaped boomerang, attached
to his nylon cord.

The helicopter rises as:  The Batman hurls his Batarang!

CLOSE ON ROTOR SHAFT

The Batarang whistles around the spinning rotor shaft which connects
the helicopter bubble cockpit to the rear rotor blades.  It hooks
tight.

WIDER ANGLE

The helicopter takes off into the night sky as the Batman is jerked
free of the building top, NOW DANGLES IN MID-AIR as the chopper
continues over Gotham!

ANGLE DOWN ON BATMAN

Suspended more than a thousand feet in the air, looking up at the
helicopter above him.

ANGLE ON ROTOR SHAFT

The rotor shaft spins, the Batarang cord encircling it.  The nylon cord
wraps itself around the shaft as the Batman is now being pulled up LIKE
A FISH ON THE LINE!

WIDER ANGLE

As the Batman rises toward the chopper through the night sky.

INT. HELICOPTER

The PILOT struggles with the controls.  A CROOK looks over.

CROOK
What the hell's wrong?

PILOT
Can't figure it...I have to compen-
sate for something on the port
side...

The Crook looks over to his left:  The night sky is clear through the
bubble cockpit.

Now suddenly rising into view:  THE FACE OF BATMAN, staring in coldly
from outside the cockpit!

Then:  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF TREMENDOUS OVATION!

INT. GOTHAM BALLROOM - NIGHT

Hundreds of Guests applaud heartily in a hotel ballroom.  Gotham's
MAYOR stands in front of a podium at the center of a dais which
includes Batman, Gordon, and Rupert Thorne.

MAYOR
...and so, in giving him the keys to
Gotham, I proclaim our Batman this
city's Man of The Year.  Year?
Hell!  The Man of a Lifetime!

A rousing ovation!  Batman rises to join the Mayor at the podium,
shaking hands with Dignitaries on his way by.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Silver stands by one of the front table, applauds heartily.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Shaking hands with Gordon, then with an overly enthusiastic Rupert
Thorne, who claps him on the back, Knute Rockne-like.

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT

A grim-faced Joker watches the festivities on television, slumped
behind a harlequin desk in his darkened lair.

BATMAN ON TV
Thank you, Mr. Mayor...
(at Crowd)
Let me be brief...

The Joker lifts what look like a remote control box, presses a button:

THE TELEVISION EXPLODES, WIPING THE SCREEN!

EXT. GOTHAM PARK ZOO - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on a zoo enclosure filled with live penguins.  A KEEPER
tosses them sardines as ONLOOKERS watch.

SILVER'S VOICE
Aren't they adorable in their little
dinner jackets?

Silver, holding a big pink balloon, stands watching them in the crowd
with Bruce.

BRUCE
Actually, it looks like a convention
of maitre d's...

SILVER
Maitre d's?
(sideways look)
So you are familiar with eating out
at night...

She turns, smiling to herself.  Bruce catches her drift.

BRUCE
Silver, look...I know it must seem
very rude, my not asking you out to
dinner...

SILVER
But you've been terribly busy...

BRUCE
I have, as a matter of fact.  I...I...

SILVER
(hurt)
Bruce, my lunch hour's practically
over.  Exactly what is it you want
to say?

BRUCE
(swallowing hard)
That...you should forget about me.
Rupert was right.  I am a grass-
hopper.  You deserve somebody more
...worthwhile.  Somebody you could
wind up...respecting.

SILVER
(pause; smile)
Now tell me the truth.

BRUCE
The truth is...I can never be in
love with anyone.  I'm too selfish.
In fact, I'm all I need.
(pause)
That's the truth.

Silver looks up softly with eyes which could melt steel.

SILVER
Liar...

She kisses him passionately, hands him her balloon, then walks away.
Bruce stares, stunned and dejected.

CAMERA PANS across to one large penguin, ZOOMS IN as it preens its
flightless wings:

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. PENGUIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

CAMERA PANS a spacious bedroom which is entirely decorated in black and
white.  A huge, four-poster bed dominates, covered by a piece of
drapery in the shape of an open umbrella, also in black and white.  It
frames the figure of THE PENGUIN who lies in bed, an ice pack on his
head, a thermometer sticking out of his mouth.

This is an elegant man, dressed in a white robe with a black collar,
propped up on black silk sheets against black-and-white checkered
pillows.  A COOING SOUND makes him glance at a partially opened window
where a pigeon has landed, now looks at him questioningly.  The Penguin
makes a clucking birdlike sound of welcome which the pigeon seems to
recognize.  It flies over to his bed, hops up into his lap.

A STATUESQUE WOMAN (EMPRESS) enters, carrying a tureen of shrimp
embedded in ice.  She wears a tight wool body stocking, a muffler
wrapped around her neck.

EMPRESS
Here, sweetie.  Eat them while they're
nice and frozen.  Feel better?

PENGUIN
A smidge.

The Penguin removes his thermometer, looks at it.

PENGUIN (O.S.)
Sixty-five degrees.  Normal.  I
can't understand it...

He takes a bite of frozen shrimp, removes the ice pack from his head,
slips it inside his robe.  He leans in, tugs on the Empress' muffler
gently, smiles.

PENGUIN (CONT'D)
Feel life...feathering the nest for
a while?

EMPRESS
If you'll let me turn the thermostat
up to forty.  That was our deal,
remember?

He strokes her face tenderly, makes his clucking sound.  Shivers runs
up and down her body.

PENGUIN
Confess.  Where you're with me, it's
always Honolulu in your heart.

EMPRESS
Are you kidding?  It's so cold in here
a flasher would have described himself.

There is a KNOCK from the doorway.  A seven-foot, sallow-looking BUTLER
(MARIBOU) with a vulture-like face appears.

MARIBOU
Excuse me, Mr. Penguin.  Your
luncheon guest has arrived.

PENGUIN
Thank you, Maribou...

MARIBOU
May I take your luncheon order now,
Sir?

The pigeon coos from the Penguin's lap.  He looks down.

PENGUIN
Why, yes, Maribou.  Yes, you may...

His hand wanders BELOW FRAME.  We hear the sound of a neck snapping.
The Empress turns away in disgust.

INT. PENGUIN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

An elegant dining room.  At one end of a checkered black-and-white
table:  the Penguin.  Dressed in white tie and tails, he pops an icy
codfish ball into his mouth.

PENGUIN
Even for a criminal as phenomenally
gifted as I - this is indeed an
honor, Sir.

At the other end - the Joker, teeth chattering, not touching his food.
Wrapped in a heavy overcoat with muffler and earmuffs, he blows into
his hands.  Four sets of candelabra are drawn in around him for warmth.

JOKER
Nice little meat locker you got here.
Who'd you buy it from, Bird's Eye?

A frozen giggle collapses.  The Penguin blinks stoically.

PENGUIN
I'm heart-broken you haven't touched
your food.  I had that clown fish
cooked especially for you.
(gestures)
Do you prefer codfish balls?

JOKER
I don't know.  I never attended any.

An insane chuckle rises, then dies, teeth chattering.

JOKER
But seriously, Big Bird...
(eyes narrowing)
I need a favor.

PENGUIN
Outside of possibly offering you a
brain scan - how may I be of help?

JOKER
(philosophical)
I've worked hard to make Gotham a city
we could all be proud of.  The kind of
place where an ambitious young hood
could come home after a hard day
dealing drugs and get some peaceful
sleep at night.  But all that was B.B.

PENGUIN
Before Batman.

JOKER
Rimshot.  I'd like to send that
cowled cop-lover on a little trip
tomorrow night.
(leans in)
But I'm going to need you to pro-
vide the flight insurance.
(giggle)
Which reminds me.  Do you know what
you get when you make love to the
wrong canary?

PENGUIN
(sigh)
I haven't a clue.

JOKER
Twerpes!

He explodes with laughter.  The Penguin stares blankly.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Not only that - but the disease is
completely untweetable!

The Penguin winces sadly, lowers his eyes as the Joker slams his semi-
frozen clown fish against his plate, his body wracked by uncontrollable
guffaws.

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

Alfred holds an aerosol wax can and a cloth.  He polishes an enormous
white animal tooth.

ALFRED
With all this extra cleaning to do,
Sir, do you mind if I engage addi-
tional staff for the mansion?

An acetylene torch whines in reply.

WIDE ANGLE - BATCAVE

We see the Batcave for the first time:  The gothic cavern walls are now
spotless.  Alfred stands on a ladder, polishing a tooth of a mechanical
Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Next to it is the giant penny.  This, along with
other exhibits, is the trophy section.

CAMERA PANS:  One area of the cave is devoted to exercise - weights,
Nautilus machines, rings - even a trapeze.  The acetylene torch whines.

CAMERA PANS:  Another section features a myriad of complicated machines
and a fully equipped crime lab.

PAST the crime lab:  Bruce lies on his back under a partially
constructed futuristic automobile.  He trains an acetylene torch
against one section as the sparks fly.  It's just the shell of a car
now - other sections and odd electronic devices are strewn about the
area.  Bruce shuts off his torch, removes a faceplate, reaches back for
a long cylindrical network of crisscrossing cables.  He starts to fit
it onto one underside edge of the chassis.

BRUCE
I'm sorry, Alfred.  Did you say
something?

ALFRED
(noticing cylinder)
What on earth is all that metallic
spaghetti in aid of?

BRUCE
There's a Magnum pistol in the table
drawer over there.  Take it out,
would you?

Alfred descends the ladder as Bruce rises, crosses to two larger
versions of the cabled cylinders.  They stand upright, some eight feet
apart from each other.  Bruce leans down, opens the top of a large
transformer box.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
I've connected two mega-transformer
leads to form a force field of a
million volts.

Bruce flips a switch - dazzling blue light begins to dance between the
cable cylinders.  Alfred turns with the gun in his hands as Bruce calls
to him from behind the sparkling wall of blue light.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Shoot me.

ALFRED
Pardon?

BRUCE
Shoot to kill.  Aim for the heart.

ALFRED
I...assume this apparatus has been
thoroughly tested, Sir?

BRUCE
We're doing it right now.

Alfred stares incredulously, the gun shaking in his hand.

ALFRED
Sir...if you've miscalculated...

BRUCE
Be a good soldier, Alfred.
(pause)
Shoot.  Now!

Alfred straightens his arm, his finger squeezing the trigger.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
(suddenly)
Wait!

TOO LATE:  Alfred fires!  The bullet bounces off the blue wall of
light, then ricochets back at Alfred, pinging into the cavern wall next
to his head!  Alfred hits the deck as the lead cartridge continues a
seemingly endless path of ricochets until there is sudden silence.

Alfred rises, sweat dripping from his brow.  Bruce grins, turning off
the blue light.

BRUCE
I forgot to tell you to duck.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY HALL - NIGHT

A taxi pulls up to the darkened City Hall.  Silver exits, starts up the
steps.

INT. CITY HALL - NIGHT

Silver enters, crosses the lobby to the elevators.  A GUARD looks up
from his night desk.

GUARD
Just a minute, Miss...

SILVER
It's okay, Victor, it's...
(sees him)
Where's Victor?

GUARD
Victor's...sick tonight.  What's
your name?

SILVER
St. Cloud.  I'm on Councilman
Thorne's staff.  Just catching up on
a little back work.

GUARD
The doors are all locked up there,
Miss, and...I'm not authorized to
open them.

Silver dangles her key with a pleasant smile, passes by him, enters the
elevator.  The doors close.  The nervous Guard picks up a house phone.

GUARD
There's a girl named Silver St. Cloud on
her way up.  I tried to stop her...

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN from the main gears of the elevator at a seemingly
endless shaft of cables.  The car carrying Silver rises quickly, jerks
to a stop at one of the top floors.

INT. CITY HALL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Silver exits the elevator, starts down the corridor for her office
door.  She passes Thorne's office, then stops, hearing MUFFLED VOICES
from inside.

SILVER
Rupert?...

There is a sudden silence.  Silver cocks her head curiously.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Rupert, it's Silver...

Silver opens the door, suddenly recoils, aghast:

ANGLE ON THORNE - HER P.O.V.

Thorne sits behind his desk, bound and gagged, tied to the chair.  His
eyes bulge in terror as Silver rushes in.

SILVER
Rupert, what happened!

JOKER'S VOICE
You like that gag?

Silver wheels to face the Joker behind her!

JOKER
Well, here's an even better one!

A stream of clear liquid shoots out from a plastic flower on the
Joker's coat lapel, drenching Silver's face as she recoils, stunned,
then instantly drops to the floor.  The Joker giggles as Thorne rises
from behind the desk, the ropes dropping off him like spaghetti.  He
takes the gag out of his mouth, looks down at Silver, nervous and
agitated.

THORNE
I can't get her involved.  This
changes everything.

JOKER
This changes nothing.
(looks down; appre-
ciative smile)
In fact, it might even give that
black-caped creep an added incentive
to walk into our trap.

THORNE
(concerned)
How long before she wakes up?

JOKER
Half an hour.
(wicked grin)
Never, if you prefer...

THORNE
(glaring coldly)
This better work out.  I warn you,
Joker - don't disappoint me.

JOKER
(crossing to door)
Please.  If everyone in this country
worked as efficiently as I do, we'd
be back on the road to prosperity.
(turns; stops)
Oh.  And starting tomorrow - after
the Batman's funeral - don't you
disappoint me, understood?

The Joker smiles cruelly, giggles, then disappears.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS the cavernous Batcave.  We HEAR the low, powerful, whining
GRIND of what seem to be turbine engines.  It rises in pitch and
intensity, growing richer and more deafening than a 747.

The blasting SOUND is coming from behind a corner of the cave, its
source unseen.  But up against one wall, in a cubicle niche:

A RED TELEPHONE PULSATES WITH GLOWING LIGHT!

INT. WAYNE MANOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Alfred walks down the hallway dressed for bed, stifles a yawn, notices
something through the open study door.

ANGLE ON STUDY DOOR - HIS P.O.V.

The light coming from the study seems to pulsate as well, first dying,
then rising.  Dying, then rising.

INT. STUDY - NIGHT

The pulsating light comes from a desk lamp.  Alfred enters, crosses,
presses a hidden button under the desk:

A bottom drawer pops open, revealing a glowing red extension of the
Batphone in the cave.

Alfred shoves the drawer back, hurries out of the study.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Alfred crosses the living room, heading for a tall grandfather's clock
at one end.  He reaches behind the clock.  We HEAR a switch ""CLICK.""
Alfred reaches behind, swivels the clock away from the wall.

The SOUND of the ENGINE WHINE becomes immediately audible.  Alfred
hurries through the opening in the wall.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY - NIGHT

Knifing up into the blackness over the skyline of Gotham City - THE
GLEAMING BATSIGNAL!

INT. THORNE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The office has been ransacked.  Drawers overturned, bookcases emptied,
with piles of paper and debris strewn across the floor.

Silver sits in a chair, conscious but still groggy.  Thorne paces
angrily in front of Gordon, kicking trash left and right as the Batman
watches from inside the doorway, his eyes darting back and forth.

THORNE
It's unbelievable!  The Joker!
Right here in my office!
(at Silver)
He could have killed her!
(realizes)
He could have killed me, for God's
sake!

BATMAN
I wonder why he didn't...

Batman crosses, eyes riveted on Silver.  She feels his magnetic gaze on
her, now stares back, fascinated by him.

THORNE
You sound disappointed!

GORDON
Calm down, Rupert!  We've got a long
night ahead of us.

THORNE
What's this we crap?

GORDON
Well, you're the only one who'd know
what was missing.
(turns)
I'll send for a squad car to drive
you home, Miss St. Cloud.

Silver nods at Gordon, then looks back into the dark, magnetically
intimidating gaze of the Batman.

SILVER
Perhaps...the Batman would be kind
enough to see me home.

THORNE
What?

Batman stares back at Silver with no apparent reaction.  She smiles
unsteadily, not sure of herself.

SILVER
If I'm not too far out of your way.

BATMAN
(pause)
I can't imagine such a place exists,
Miss St. Cloud.

THORNE
Oh, brother...

Silver blushes, then rises, offers Batman her arm.

SILVER
Good-night, Rupert...

THORNE
Wait!...

Batman leads Silver out the door.  Thorne's face trembles with rage and
frustration as Gordon looks over curiously.

GORDON
Relax, Rupert.  Who could she be
safer with?

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Thorne's troubled face.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Batman leads Silver to the elevator, presses the button.

SILVER
We're taking the elevator?

BATMAN
Doesn't everybody?

SILVER
Why did I have this feeling we'd be
dropping out a window together, or
something exotic like that...

The elevator arrives.  They enter.

INT. TOP OF ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT

The main gears of the elevator shaft start to churn.  Suddenly:  the
beam from a welding torch appears, rapidly cutting away at one of the
cables.

CAMERA PANS:  The Penguin hangs suspended in the shaft, supported in
mid-air by the whirling ribs of a HUGE UMBRELLA hooked to the back of
his belt.  He trains the torch on the cable, looks down, ""clucks""
contently.

Suddenly:  THE CABLE SNAPS!

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

A jarring jolt.  The elevator suddenly drops!  Silver screams as she
and Batman are momentarily pushed up into the air.  Batman grabs onto a
light fixture in the roof, bashes the ceiling escape hatch away.

ANGLE ON ELEVATOR

Plummeting down the shaft.

BACK TO BATMAN

He reaches into his utility belt, pulls out a nail-like piece of curved
metal attached to a nylon cord.  It pops open into a large, four-
pronged fish hook.

BATMAN
Grab my belt!  Hang on!

ANGLE IN SHAFT

The hook flies out of the top of the sinking elevator heading for the
wall of the shaft.  It grazes down the shaft wall, catches on one set
of gears which allow the doors to open on each individual floor.  The
nylon cord goes taut.

BACK TO ELEVATOR

Silver hangs on as Batman hooks his arm around her.  The two of them
shoot upwards through the escape hatch.

ANGLE ON ELEVATOR

Still plummeting.  It hits the ground with an ear-splitting, sickening
crash.

INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

A WASHERWOMAN standing by the elevator doors, with her mop and pail,
presses the ""down"" button.  It opens.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman and Silver hang by the cord in the shaft, her arms locked around
him in a death grip.  She stares, goggle-eyed.

BATMAN
(at Silver)
Next time - remind me to try the
window.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Batman and Silver walk down a deserted street.  She is a wreck -
trembling, ripped dress, with streaks of cable grease on her face and
hair.

BATMAN
I'm parked in the alleyway.  Didn't
want to attract attention.

SILVER
A bit late for that, isn't it?

Suddenly:  THE ROAR OF ENGINES IS HEARD FROM THE SKY!  Batman and
Silver's heads snap up:

ANGLE ON PENGUIN'S GANG - THEIR P.O.V.

THREE PENGUIN CONFEDERATES whizz down at them through the night sky
wearing jetpacks!  Orange flames shoot out from behind their propelling
rigs as they maneuver through the air, now heading into a synchronized
power dive.

The Penguin hovers above, still supported by his whirling umbrella-
copter.

A hail of MACHINE GUN BULLETS spews forth from guns mounted on top of
their packs - the flyers close in on Batman and Silver like attacking
fighter planes.

BACK TO BATMAN AND SILVER

Batman dives behind a row of garbage cans, pushing a screaming Silver
down in front of him as the fusillade ricochets off the cans and
building walls.

The flying formation zooms back up into the sky again, preparing to
make another pass.  Batman turns to a trembling Silver who is paralyzed
with fear.

BATMAN
Stay here!  It's me they want...

SILVER
Don't leave me!!

Batman turns and looks:  she is a quaking mess.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Oh, please?  I've been a pretty
cheap date so far.

BATMAN
(pause)
Let's go.

He takes her hand as they run into the alleyway.

ANGLE ON SKY

The Penguin's group have reassembled in a formation and start another
power dive.

INT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

The screen is totally black.  Suddenly - one glaring yellow headlight
in the shape of an eye appears!  Then another.

ANGLE ON ENGINES

Twin turbine engines fire up - their glowing red exhaust filling the
screen.

ANGLE ON STREET

THE BATMOBILE screams from the alley out into the street.  A sleek,
powerful, futuristic panther of a car - jet black with a domed
interior.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

The interior is a glistening, intricate maze of computers, screens, and
complicated electrical systems.  Silver's eyes are frozen open in
astonishment.  Batman looks over.

BATMAN
Please don't touch anything.

SILVER
Like the cigarette lighter?

Batman smiles, points it out.  There is one.

ANGLE ON SKY

The Penguin and his three Jetpack Bandits zoom down at the car, their
mounted machine guns BLAZING.  Bandit #1 powers forward, spewing
bullets as he comes.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

A succession of RICOCHET HITS on the Batmobile roof causes Silver to
hunch over in terror as Batman flips a switch.

ANGLE ON BATMOBILE

The two coiled cylinders under either side of the car suddenly eject
intersecting streams of blue light (the force field we saw tested in
the Batcave) which now bathes the entire vehicle in a SOLID BLUE GLOW.

A new hail of bullets ricochets off the impregnable field of blue
light, zinging back up into the air in the direction from which they
came.

ANGLE ON BANDITS

Their face registering horror as several of their own bullets whizz by
them, narrowly missing!  They soar higher to avoid their own fire.

BACK ON BATMOBILE

Speeding down an avenue along the side of the park.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks over hopefully.

SILVER
I guess we frightened them off.

Batman shakes his head, flips another switch:  A small radar screen
lights up.  Three blinking LIGHT BLIPS are still following them.
Batman suddenly looks ahead, eyes widening.

ANOTHER CAR heads directly at them, guns blazing!

SILVER (CONT'D)
I think I'll keep my mouth shut.

ANGLE ON STREET

The HOOD CAR swerves off the street into the park.  The Batmobile
squeals into a 180 and roars after it.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY

The Penguin watches from the sky with satisfaction.

PENGUIN
He's taken the bait...

He motions two Bandits to fly off in another direction, then:  swivels
in mid-air, points Bandit #3 down at the Batmobile.

PENGUIN (CONT'D)
The tires, you Cretin!  Go for the tires!

ANGLE ON PARK ROAD

The Batmobile pursues the Hood Car through the park as Bandit #3 looms
up from behind, guns blazing.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks over at a terrified Silver reassuringly.

BATMAN
Don't worry...

SILVER
Worry?
(trying nonchalance)
How's the...ah...mileage on this?

BATMAN
It doesn't use gasoline.

SILVER
Of course not.  Silly of me...

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Guns blazing down at the road behind the Batmobile.

ANGLE ON ROAD

A stream of bullets advances inexorably toward the rear tires of the
Batmobile.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman realizes what's happening and presses a button.

ANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE

Steel casings drop down over the tires as the bullets make contact too
late, ping off them harmlessly.

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Whizzing along through the air behind the Batmobile, registering his
frustration.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

BATMAN
Do you know what the number one hazard
is on the American road these days?

SILVER
(weak smile)
Surprise me...

BATMAN
Tailgaters.

ANGLE ON REAR OF BATMOBILE

The trunk of the Batmobile suddenly pops open!  A giant horseshoe
magnet swivels, pointing out behind the car!

ANGLE ON BANDIT #3

Screaming, wide-eyed, as the force of the powerful magnet spins him in
mid-air and he is sucked into the trunk by his jetpack.  The trunk
closes on him, slamming shut.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN SKY

The Penguin looks down disgustedly, then lifts his gaze ahead and
below, into the park.

EXT. PARK - ANGLE ON CURVE - NIGHT

A Bandit watches near a curve in the park road as the Hood Car roars
by.  He gestures impatiently off into the darkness.

Bandit #2 settles in behind a jest of rocks, trains an automatic weapon
back down the road.

BACK TO BATMOBILE

Roaring through the park TOWARD CAMERA.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks ahead, suddenly worried.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Two blazing headlights seem to be speeding directly at him, growing
larger by the second!

BACK TO BATMOBILE

SILVER
Hit the brakes!  Hit the brakes!

Batman grimly steps on the accelerator!

ANGLE ON FRONT BUMPER

Now emerging from the front of the Batmobile:  a long, black battering
ram with a RAZOR SHARP GLEAMING STEEL TIP!

BACK TO VIEW THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The two oncoming headlights are about to make contact as:

WIDER ANGLE

The Batmobile EXPLODES though what was a GIANT MIRROR in a sea of
flying glass!

Bandit #2 lets off an ineffectual burst of automatic fire, now lowers
his weapon in disgust as the vehicle roars on.

BACK TO PENGUIN IN SKY

Gritting his teeth in frustration, looking up ahead.

EXT. PARK - ANGLE OF BRIDGE OVER LAKE - NIGHT

The Park road curves onto a bridge which spans the park lake.  The Hood
Car speeds quickly across it.

ANGLE BELOW BRIDGE

A Bandit stands by a plunger-detonator device.

BACK TO BRIDGE

The Batmobile starts across at full speed.  Suddenly - A HUGE EXPLOSION
collapses the section of the bridge directly in front of it!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Plummeting down through the air toward the lake.  Batman works his
controls frantically as Silver screams!

ANGLE ON LAKE

The Batmobile plunges into the lake!  A brilliant SHOWER OF BLUE SPARKS
explode across the water's surface as the vehicle disappears.  For a
moment, all is still.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR

The Penguin looks down, ""clucking"" contentedly.  His expression
suddenly starts to change.

ANGLE ON LAKE - HIS P.O.V.

Slowly re-emerging on the surface of the lake:  The Batmobile!  Its
roaring turbine engines propel it forward, now supported by TWO
HYDROFOIL PONTOONS!  The makeshift craft speeds over the water at
speedboat velocity.

The Batmobile reaches shore, churning up chunks of mud as the pontoons
contract and the car bounces onto the park road.  The protective blue
light has been extinguished.  From either side:  two Hood Cars
approach, machine guns blazing!

Batman swerves the Batmobile onto the grass, roars cross-country toward
a park exit as the hail of bullets begins to make CRACKS across its
protective dome.

ANGLE ON PARK EXIT AND STREET

The Batmobile speeds out into the street.  One Hood Car is in hot
pursuit - the other exits the park a block ahead and roars at the
Batmobile from the other direction!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks over at Batman, trembling, as more bullets ""chunk"" into
the car dome, weakening it further.

SILVER
Listen...it was nice of you to offer
to take me home, but maybe I'd
better grab a cab...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The Batmobile is about to become a sandwich as Batman suddenly squeals
the vehicle into a parking building!  The Hood Cars do respective 180's
and follow suit.

INT. PARKING BUILDING - NIGHT

The Batmobile roars around hairpin turns, ascending the levels of the
parking building like a sportscar.

The Hood Cars screech after him, gaining speed.  They pursue Batman
higher and higher, threading the narrow openings through the lines of
parked cars, tearing off side mirrors, doors, and fenders on their way
by.

ANGLE ON HIGHER LEVEL

The Batmobile, reaching the level just under the roof, squeals around a
corner, catches the fender of a parked car, and spins out of control!

Batman slams on the brakes as the Batmobile skids and turns to face:

The two Hood Cars, which have stopped so that they are completely
blocking off the exit ramps, up and down.  The OCCUPANTS stare in
amazement as the Batmobile suddenly roars at them!

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman's jaw sets as he looks forward.

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

A sign at the bottom of a narrow ramp leading to the roof screams in
red letters:  WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER - SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE!

BACK TO PARKING LEVEL

The Batmobile shoots up the wrong-way ramp!

CLOSE OF METAL TEETH

As the Batmobile's tires make contact with the viciously protruding
metal teeth - ALL FOUR TIRES BLOW!  The vehicle roars on, flub-a-
dubbing up toward the roof.

EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

The Batmobile exits onto the roof as the two Hood Cars, appearing from
the proper ramp, fan out to flank it.

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN AIR

The Penguin takes up a position in mid-air just above and past the
roof, ""clucking"" with glee as he sees the Batman is hopelessly trapped.

BACK TO ROOF

The two Hood Cars close in on the Batmobile from either side.  Batman
is running out of room.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Silver looks through the windshield in despair!

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD

The edge of the roof looms up rapidly!

SILVER'S VOICE
Oh, my God!

She looks over at Batman whose JAW SUDDENLY TWITCHES!

EXTREME CLOSE ON SILVER

She has seen his jaw twitch!  She stares in disbelief, realizing the
implications.

SILVER
(whisper)
Oh, my God...

BATMAN
Hang on!

Batman presses a RED BUTTON!

EXTREME CLOSE ON EXHAUST

The Batmobile's twin turbine engines EXPLODE WITH A WHITE FLAME!  Jet-
propelled afterburners ignite!

WIDER ANGLE

The Batmobile has reached the edge of the roof, now LAUNCHES ITSELF
into space in an upwards arc!

The two Hood Cars are unable to cope with the sudden void between them
and crash head-on with a sickening crunch!

ANGLE ON PENGUIN IN MID-AIR

Staring in total shock - frozen in mid-air as the Batmobile arcs up
toward him.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

The figure of the Penguin grows rapidly larger through the windshield.
BATMAN HONKS AT HIM!

BACK TO MID-AIR

The Penguin takes a panicked, last-second evasive action, diving low as
the Batmobile streaks by:

The white-hot turbine flames from the vehicle's exhaust crease the top
of his umbrella-copter's whirling ribs, MELTING THEM INTO DISFIGURED
CURLEQUES!

The Penguin looks up in despair as his umbrella-copter begins to spin
out of control.  He gives a birdlike SCREECH, then zig-zags helplessly
through the air!

BACK TO BATMOBILE

The sleek vehicle completes its downward arc through the air and lands
on the roof of the building across the street.

EXT. GOTHAM SKY

The Penguin cartwheels end over end through the air, his umbrella-
copter sputtering.

INT. RICH APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dozens of GUESTS surround a lavishly decorated banquet table in an
expensive apartment.  A Bar Mitzvah celebration is in progress.  The
proud FATHER puts a loving arm around his thirteen-year-old son.

FATHER
And so, Marvin, on this most special
of all days, your mother and I have
prepared a big surprise for you...

ANGLE ON SIDE OF APARTMENT BUILDING

The spinning, rudderless Penguin careens through an open window on the
side of the apartment building.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Penguin crash-lands on the end of the banquet table, sending food
and Guests flying everywhere as he skids along, clearing it, finally
splattering to a stop through an enormous pile of chicken livers into a
mountain of cracked ice under a banner reading:  TODAY YOU ARE A MAN.

The stunned Guests hesitate a moment, then burst into wild,
unrestrained APPLAUSE!

EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

The Batmobile sits parked on the roof where it landed.

INT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT

Batman looks over at Silver who has fainted dead away.  She murmurs as
he gently prods her.

BATMAN
Miss St. Cloud...Miss St. Cloud?

Silver's eyes flutter open, trying to regain focus.

BATMAN (CONT'D)
May I take you home now?

INT. SILVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Batman and Silver stop at her apartment door.  She smiles at him
through smeared elevator cable grease.

BATMAN
I'm...very sorry for tonight.  You
must have been terrified.

SILVER
Well, I've thought of a way you can
make it up to me.

Batman looks at her curiously.  She suddenly kisses him, deeply.  He
allows it, unwilling or unable to pull away.

CLOSE-UP

Silver's eyes open.  She knows - or thinks she does.

They break.  Silver smiles mysteriously, whistles under her breath,
enters her apartment.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She leans against the door, sighs.  Could it be true?

BACK TO BATMAN

On the other side of the door, worried.  Does she know?

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

The quiz show The Joker Is Wild broadcasts before a live audience.  A
CONTESTANT stands by three large video panels in the shape of a slot
machine.

JACK BARRY
All right, Otto, you've got two
thousand dollars.  Spin the wheel!

Otto pulls a lever - the first panel screen lights up.

JACK BARRY (CONT'D)
Joker...
(next panel)
Joker...
(next panel)
Joker!

A burst of machine gun fire riddles the third panel to shreds.
Stepping through it - the Joker.  An armed Gang rushes in after him,
holds Jack Barry and the audience at bay.  The Joker steps to center
stage.

JOKER
Good evening, ladies and germs.  I
Just flew in from Lost Wages,
Nevada, and boy, are my arms tired!

He giggles.  There is a stony silence from the audience.

JOKER (CONT'D)
Gimme a break, folks, I'm a Veteran.
Man walks into a bar, says, ""Have
you got any Wild Turkey?""  Bartender
say, ""No, but I can get a tame one
and irritate it for you.""

He roars.  The audience stares back.  His eyes narrow.

JOKER (CONT'D)
But I digress.  You see, I'm in the
process of developing a new series...
(evil smile)
...of killings.  All original, all
different, believe me, folks, you're
gonna die laughing.  And there's only
one man who can cancel my little show
the Batman.  Because from now
on, each time he appears in public,
every time he's seen anywhere - one
prominent citizen of Gotham will die.
(to camera)
I'm tired of fighting you, Batman,
so the people are going to do it for
me.  Either you lose...
(at audience)
or they do.

INT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT

CAMERA CLOSE on a television screen - the crackling face of the Joker
disappears.

Bruce flips off a VCR, looks over at a worried Alfred.

BRUCE
When did you tape this?

ALFRED
Not quite an hour ago.

Bruce rises, begins to pace.

ALFRED (CONT'D)
Why can't you do what he did, Sir?
Go on television as the Batman, and
explain your case to the people.

BRUCE
And risk having an innocent human being
murdered for my sake?  I can't chance it.

Bruce turns away in disgust, his mind racing.

ALFRED
(sympathetic)
Well...perhaps a night on the town
as Bruce Wayne might be therapeutic
for you after all.  You do have
tickets for the gala opening of the
opera.  I was planning on using one
myself, but if you'd prefer a more
lively and decorative companion I
quite understand.

BRUCE
You know what?  It's been so long I
can't even think of whom to call
anymore.

ALFRED
Not even one name?

BRUCE
(sudden grin)
Well maybe just one.

EXT. GOTHAM OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

Dozens of shiny limousines disgorge Gotham's formally dressed ELITE in
front of the opera house.  Photographer's flashbulbs indicate that it
is indeed a gala opening.  The billboard marquee advertises:
I PAGLIACCI.

CAMERA PANS to one arriving limo and we hear a TELEPHONE RINGING over
the scene.  Silver's VOICE answers it.

SILVER'S VOICE
Hi.  This is Silver.  I'm not home
right now, but if you'd leave a
message at the ""beep,"" I'll get back
to you as soon as I can.

The limo pulls up to the front of the opera house.  Silver exits in a
shimmering evening gown.  AT THE SOUND OF THE ""BEEP"" we see her escort:
Rupert Thorne.  They make their way inside past a battery of
photographers.

INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

A maze of BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE mingles in the lobby, exchanging greetings
and appreciative glances.  An ARMY ARCHERD-type comments on the passing
parade for local television.

ARMY ARCHERD
...I'm telling you, they're all
here tonight, folks!  Newsome two-
somes, tiresome twosomes, from show
biz, sports, politics...
(looks off)
There's millionaire socialite, Bruce
Wayne!

ANGLE ON BRUCE

As Bruce makes his way through the throng with Alfred.

BACK TO SCENE

ARMY ARCHERD
(turning)
And here's a man for all seasons -
Gotham's own City Councilman, Rupert
Thorne!

Thorne slides up to Archerd with a hearty smile.  Silver hangs back,
suddenly spotting Bruce, surprised.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Having spotted Silver too.  Gazing in frustration.

BACK TO SILVER

She locks eyes with Bruce as Rupert slides his arm around Army
Archerd's shoulder.

ARMY ARCHERD
I didn't realize you were an opera
fan, Councilman...

THORNE
To tell the truth, I'm not, Army,
but any elected official with as
many Italian constituents as I have
would be darn well advised to give
it a try.

Rupert laughs heartily as suddenly:  A HUGE COMMOTION is heard outside!
MUFFLED GASPS give way to FRANTIC MURMURS, then local silence as:  The
Batman appears in the doorway!

Rupert stares, wide-eyed.  Archerd blinks in disbelief as the Crowd
parts and Batman enters the lobby.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Frozen.  He exchanges an incredulous glance with Alfred.

CLOSE ON SILVER

Totally taken aback.  Her gaze flicks from Bruce to Batman to Bruce to
Batman like someone watching a tennis match.

ANGLE ON GORDON AT TOP OF STAIRS

Gordon stands in a group at the top of the stairs to the mezzanine,
looking down in dismay.

BACK TO SCENE

The Batman joins Rupert and Archerd at the microphone with a cold and
distant air.  (His resemblance to Bruce is uncanny.)  Archerd swallows
nervously.

ARCHERD
You're...taking quite a chance,
showing up in public like this,
aren't you, Batman?

BATMAN
The way I see it, we're all taking
quite a chance if we let a sick
criminal mind like the Joker paralyze
this entire community with fear.

An angry MUTTERING is heard from within the Crowd.

CROWD MEMBER
Sure.  He's not the one who's
going to get killed...

Batman's head snaps around angrily at the remark.

BATMAN
Step forward and say that to my
face, if you've got the guts!

The Crowd hangs back, confused and frightened.  More angry muttering is
heard, now mixed in with boos.

CROWD #2
CROWD #3
					 Get him out of here!
Go home, Batman!

The boos grow louder and defiant, as Gordon hurries to the fake
Batman's side and Thorne smiles thinly at the imposter.

THORNE
It seems you're not exactly the
people's choice anymore, Batman...

GORDON
(at Batman)
C'mon.  Let me get you out of here
before these gentle people tear you
up into little pieces...

Gordon leads a reluctant Batman away through the jeering Crowd.  Bruce
watches in horror with Alfred as the taunts continue.

CROWD #4
CROWD #5
		   Leave us alone!
I'm not getting killed for

you!

ALFRED
(grim whisper)
A rather cruel sort of joke,
wouldn't you say?

BRUCE
(nods coldly)
And I don't think we've heard the
punch line yet.

Gordon appears in the doorway, raises his arms to quiet the panicking
Crowd.

GORDON
Settle down, folks!  Take it easy
now!  I've got half the police in
this city on their way over here!
So if you'll all take your seats...

CROWD #6
CROWD #7
						 Is he crazy?
Let's get out of here!

THORNE
(into mike)
Wait!!

There is a hush.  A stern-faced Thorne plays to his audience for all
he's worth.

THORNE (CONT'D)
What the Batman just did was inex-
cusable.  Perhaps even criminal.
But he's right about one thing.  No
cheap hoodlum is going to intimidate
Rupert Thorne while I still have the
saliva to spit on him!  My ticket
says seat E-6, and that's where I'm
parking my keyster for the next
few hours!
(pause; low voice)
And I call upon His Honor, the
Mayor, to join me in the audience.

The Crowd looks over to the side of the lobby:

GOTHAM'S MAYOR emerges from a group of onlookers.  A grey-haired man
who is visibly terrified, he swallows hard.

MAYOR
Councilman Thorne is right, of
course.  And I expect every other
decent citizen of Gotham City to
stand up and be counted.

The Mayor silently starts up the stairs to the mezzanine.  After a
beat, Thorne theatrically extends his arm to Silver who hesitates, then
reluctantly joins him.  They start for the orchestra section as others
in the Crowd begin to follow.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

Watching Silver disappear.  His jaw twitches.

INT. OPERA MEZZANINE - NIGHT

Bruce and Alfred head for their box.  The Mayor approaches from the
other direction, now escorted by Gordon and a phalanx of Police.  The
Mayor sees Bruce and stops to shake hands.

MAYOR
It's good of you to stay, Bruce...

BRUCE
You've made a courageous decision,
Your Honor.  I hope it's the right
one.

The Mayor nods grimly, enters his box.  The Police form a guard by the
door.

INT. BRUCE'S BOX - NIGHT

As Bruce and Alfred enter.  Gordon stands in their box, a radio
receiver in his ear.  A loud ovation is heard.

WIDE SHOT - AUDIENCE

The audience is on its feet, facing away from the stage, applauding the
Mayor in his box.  The Mayor lifts his arms in a victory salute.  The
applause dies down.  The lights dim.  The Overture to I Pagliacci is
heard, O.S.   CAMERA RISES past the Mayor and his party to the hanging
chandelier directly above him.  The fixture consists of huge crystal
teardrops.

EXTREME CLOSE ON CHANDELIER

One of the crystals is filled with a clear liquid.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce and Alfred settle into their chairs.  Gordon mumbles into his
radio receiver, ever watchful.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. OPERA HOUSE - ANGLE ON STAGE

The Leading Man (CANIO), dressed as a clown, sings the aria ""Vesti La
Giubba"".  A passionate, sad piece.  He kneels in front of a large
gaily-painted drum.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Alfred nods off in his chair.  Bruce elbows him gently.

BACK TO CANIO

Approaching the high point of the aria.  With a magnificent voice, he
reaches for a ""High C"", hits it strongly and purely, holds on to the
note.

ANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX

The Mayor and his party exchange impressed glances.  CAMERA PUSHES IN
ON the chandelier teardrop.  It trembles from the force of the High C -
now cracks.  The liquid drips down into the box.

BACK TO STAGE

The sad aria is ending.  Canio is on his knees, sobbing.  He sings
pianissimo, milking every heart-breaking second.  Suddenly - O.S. - a
chuckle.  Then the sound of laughter.  Canio peers angrily into the
audience.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Confused, then irritated, as the laughter grows louder.

ANGLE ON MAYOR'S BOX

The Mayor and his Party guffaw loudly, pounding their chairs in glee.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Bruce rises from his seat, concerned.

BACK TO MAYOR

Tears of laughter stream down the Mayor's cheeks.  He is on his feet
now, totally out of control.  The others flop over their chairs,
roaring helplessly.

BACK TO CANIO

He walks off the stage in disgust.

BACK TO MAYOR'S BOX

With a sudden, final burst of insane giggling - all four men collapse.
The Mayor hangs over the edge of his box, dead - a grotesque grin
frozen on his face.

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Gasping.  Panicking.  As:

ANGLE ON STAGE

The huge clown drum suddenly rips apart from the center.  The Joker
steps out, dressed as an obese soprano.

JOKER
Wait!  The opera's not over till the
fat lady sings!

The Joker hits his own version of a High C as:

GORDON'S VOICE
Open fire!

The lights go out.  Gunfire and screaming are heard in the darkness.
Total pandemonium.

INSERT SHOT - GOTHAM TRIBUNE

The Gotham Tribune cartwheels into frame:  CLOWN PRINCE OF CRIME MAKES
GOOD ON BOAST.  Rupert Thorne appointed acting Mayor.  In the center of
the page:  a large photograph of the Batman with the caption:  A
KILLER?

INT. BATCAVE - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

Bruce paces dejectedly, a tiny figure lost in the vastness of the
enormous cavern.

ANGLE FROM STAIRS

Alfred watches sadly from the top of the stairs.

BACK TO BRUCE

Still pacing.  Thinking.  He passes the huge crime computer, pauses,
looks down, punches some keys.

ANGLE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

A series of CRIMINAL MUG SHOTS flashes across the screen, law-breakers
of every variety, finally stopping at:

The face of the Joker - grinning down menacingly.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring back.  Face set.  Jaw twitching.

The screen suddenly goes blank.

WIDER ANGLE

Alfred has turned off the computer.  Bruce stares numbly.

ALFRED
Sir, I...
(swallows)
Perhaps...this isn't the only way.
Perhaps this is all meant to signal
a...a new beginning for you.  After
all, you're an intelligent, enter-
prising young man with every capa-
bility in the world to...

Bruce puts his hand on Alfred's shoulder.

BRUCE
I...know you love me very much, and I'm
deeply grateful, but I wish you'd get
out of here now, and leave me alone.

Alfred pauses, then nods, walks off dejectedly.

CLOSE ON BRUCE

He wanders through the cave with glassy eyes, passing a table near the
Batmobile.  On it - a new version of the battering ram.  Bruce picks it
up, smiles bitterly, carries it in one hand as he continues to wander,
passing the crime lab section.

Suddenly - he lashes out - sends the battering ram flying through a set
of glass beakers filled with chemicals.  Swinging it wildly now, he
destroys a section of the crime lab, then sinks heavily into a chair,
head bowed.

EXTREME WIDE ANGLE

The cavernous Batcave.  The tiny, slumped figure of Bruce.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - WIDE ANGLE - DAY

The hot noonday sun drenches the spacious grounds of Wayne Manor.  Seen
running along a track cut on the periphery of the estate:  the solitary
figure of Bruce Wayne.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - DAY

Alfred watches from the window, concerned, as O.S., the TELEPHONE
starts to RING.

EXT. RUNNING TRACK - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on Bruce's grimly determined face, oblivious to the
rivulets of sweat which pour down freely.  His body is encased in
several layers of exercise clothes, deeply stained by perspiration,
that turn him into a human pressure cooker.  His legs churn like
disassociated pistons.

BACK TO ALFRED

The telephone continues to RING.  Alfred turns, still distracted by the
sight of Bruce and answers it.

ALFRED
(into phone)
Mr. Wayne's residence...I'm sorry, he's
not available...No, as I told you previ-
ously, I don't know when that would be,
but if you'd care to leave another
message...

INT. CITY HALL OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA CLOSE on the door to an inner office marked:  Special Assistant
to the Mayor - Private.

The door opens as Silver exits into her outer office, followed by
several NEEDY-LOOKING CONSTITUENTS.

SILVER
...I'll take it up with Mayor
Thorne.  Gotham needs an effective
network of daycare centers, and
tomorrow night's charity opening of
the circus seems like a good place
to start.

The Constituents thank her profusely.  Silver crosses to her
SECRETARY's desk with a hopeful look.

SILVER
Any luck?

SECRETARY
Nada.  Mr. Wayne seems to be perma-
nently...unavailable.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Wayne Manor seems deserted under the glow of the moon.

ANGLE ON BRUCE IN POOL

The Olympic-sized Wayne Manor swimming pool is illuminated by the glow
of outdoor lights.  In it:  Bruce swims laps, knifing through the water
with powerful strokes.

EXT. POOL - CLOSE ON BRUCE - NIGHT

Bruce churns through the water, eyes glazed with a total single-
mindedness.  His speed is Olympian.  As he tilts his head to take
another gulp of air, he suddenly stops dead in the water as he sees:

ANGLE ON SILVER - HIS P.O.V.

Silver emerges from the darkness, her glistening hair cascading down
over an evening dress.  She carries a wooden tray with two glasses of
champagne on it, smiles as she faces a stunned Bruce who stands waist-
high in the water.

SILVER
You know, Bruce, you simply must
pick up your phone messages.

BRUCE
(careful pause)
If I did - what would they say?

SILVER
That we were supposed to have dinner
tonight.

Silver smiles, kicks off her shoes.

SILVER (CONT'D)
For some strange reason, I thought you
might suddenly have an evening free.


BRUCE
Silver...look...
(with difficulty)
I...hope you won't misunderstand
what I'm about to say...

SILVER
There aren't going to be any more
Misunderstandings between us, Bruce.
And I warn you.

Silver slowly and calmly begins walking down the steps into the pool,
carrying the tray with her.  The water rises above the hemline of her
evening dress, heading up for her waist as she advance toward as
astonished Bruce.

SILVER (CONT'D)
I can be a very determined person.

Silver arrives at Bruce, the water now up to her chest, letting the
wooden tray with the champagne float on the surface next to them.  She
hands him a glass, takes the other herself, raises it, stares deeply
into his eyes.

SILVER (CONT'D)
To no more misunderstandings.

Bruce smiles in spite of himself, tosses back his champagne, then
studies her unwavering gaze carefully.  Flipping the glass over his
head, he suddenly pulls her toward him, locking her in a passionate,
hungry kiss.

They finally break.  Silver purrs, whispers into his ear.

SILVER (CONT'D)
There...see what I mean about mis-
understandings?

BRUCE
No.  What?

SILVER
Well just now - a moment ago - I
thought you were being rude, not
getting out of the pool to say hello.
(looks down; grins)
I didn't realize you weren't wearing
a bathing suit.

INT. BRUCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bruce lies naked under powder-blue silk sheets.  A lovely hand comes
INTO FRAME, gently strokes his cheek.

SILVER (O.S.)
When I think of how many nights I've
reached across an empty pillow, hoping
my hand would find that face...

Then - a shining mane of hair as Silver, also naked, wraps him in a
tight embrace.  They kiss.

BRUCE
There's so much to explain.  And I'm
not quite sure I ever can.

SILVER
I don't need explanations.  I just
want whatever it was to evaporate.
to simple disappear...

She rolls over, looks at him carefully.  A Police siren is heard
faintly in the distance.  Bruce blinks.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Did you ever meet him?

BRUCE
Who?

SILVER
The Batman.
(smiles)
Every time I hear a siren.  I think
of the Batman.

BRUCE
I...ran into him a few times.  Here
and there.

Silver smiles down tenderly, studying him.

SILVER
You know...that night at the opera.  I
never believed that the real Batman
would show up like that in public -
not when he knew someone else's life
was on the line.

BRUCE
(deadly stare)
You're right.  He wouldn't.

Bruce suddenly breaks eye contact, unsure if she thinks she's talking
about Batman or to Batman.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
You...met him too one night, didn't
you?  Commissiner Gordon told me he
took you home or something.

SILVER
(smiles; remembers)
Or something.
(pause)
What can I say?  He was dashing, re-
sourceful, strong - very sweet in
his own special way - all the
things you'd expect from the Batman.
(grins)
The next morning I told Rupert I'd
fallen madly in love with him.

BRUCE
You don't say.

SILVER
(penetrating gaze)
And what's more - I told Rupert I
was sure that the Batman...had
fallen in love with me.

They look deeply into each other's eyes.  Silver smiles.

BRUCE
I...think I'm jealous.

SILVER
I think I'm in love.

They wrap themselves in each other passionately.

EXT. GOTHAM CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

A billboard:  THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH.  Featuring - The Flying
Graysons.  All new spectacular extravaganza - THE GLORY THAT WAS ROME.
Past the billboard is a maze of smaller tents for sideshows, the
housing of animals, etc.  Past the - the big top itself.

CAMERA PANS the arriving SPECTATORS, Bruce and Silver among them.  They
are surrounded by mothers and children.

BRUCE
It's almost immoral, you know.
Going to the circus without bringing
your own children along.

SILVER
Don't worry.  I've made plans for
the next time.

Bruce looks over, alarmed.  Silver grins.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Lighten up.  My sister has two kids.

INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

A major parade (The Glory That Was Rome) is filing out.  Pretty GIRLS
in togas ride elephants.  Handsome CHARIOTEERS drive by, GLADIATORS
with trained bears, etc.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
And there you have it, ladies and
gentlemen, The Glory That Was Rome!

ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

Bruce and Silver sit in the audience applauding.  He eats popcorn.  She
munches on cotton candy.

ANGLE ON BIG TOP ENTRANCE

A dozen CLOWNS of every shape and variety run into the arena, squirting
water at each other through toy guns, roughhousing, doing pratfalls,
etc., all to the delight of the Crowd.

ANGLE INTO ARENA FROM TUNNEL

Inside an entrance tunnel, CAMERA HOLDS behind the outline of a black-
cowled head with pointed ears!  The head lowers OUT OF FRAME, then
reappears, this time covered by a CLOWN MASK!

The Clown Figure hurries out of the tunnel, wearing a floor-lengthed
granny dress.

BACK TO ARENA

Several of the other Clowns have dispersed, running up into the
audience as a DRUM ROLL is heard.  The Granny Clown edges over toward
the cage containing the big cats.

BACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER

One Clown runs up the aisle past them with what seems to be a bucket of
water, spots Silver, flings the contents of the bucket at her!  Bruce
and Silver flinch as a SHOWER OF CONFETTI blankets them to general
laughter and applause.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
Now let me direct your attention to
the trapeze and high wire.  Out
stars of the evening - The Flying
Graysons!

ANGLE ON GRAYSONS

A family of aerialists.  The older Graysons, trim and athletic, stand
on one platform.  Their son, DICK, stands on the other.  He is in his
middle teens, a handsome young man in immaculate physical shape.  He
takes hold of a trapeze, swings down.

ANGLE ON STANDS

The Clown who poured the confetti on Bruce and Silver watches through
pancake makeup with more than a passing interest.  Protruding from
underneath a large silly hat:  we see the edges of a startling green
shock of hair.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick Grayson swings on the trapeze in a long, powerful arc, executes a
difficult flip into the arms of his father.

BACK TO BRUCE

BRUCE
Remarkable.  That young boy's one of
the greatest natural aerialists I've
ever seen.

SILVER
Oh?  I didn't realize you were so
familiar with the sport.

Silver gives Bruce a sideways look which he avoids.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
And now Dick Grayson will attempt to
perform the incredible ""Quadruple!""
Without a net!  He is the only flier
in the world to accomplish this feet!

ANGLE ON DICK

A DRUM ROLL is heard.  Dick swings down, picking up momentum, then back
up, then down again.  On his third pass, he tries it:  revolves
dizzyingly - MAKING FOUR COMPLETE SOMERSAULTS IN MID-AIR!  (Note:
There is, actually, only one person in the world who can do this, with
Ringling Bros.)  Dick completes the impossible feat to wild applause.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

On their feet, applauding enthusiastically with the Crowd.

ANGLE ON CLOWN (JOKER)

The Clown (Joker) giggles under his breath, lifts one billowing sleeve
of his oversized costume, begins to unbutton it.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
The Graysons will now perform their
world-famous maneuver on the high-
wire - passing each other and
exchanging positions - all without
a net!

BACK TO BRUCE AND SILVER

Both starring up, wide-eyed.

ANGLE ON GRAYSONS

The older Graysons stand at either end of a high wire some seventy feet
off the ground.  They each hold a long balancing pole, now start
forward toward each other.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick looks up from below, nervous but proud.

RINGMASTER (V.O.)
The slightest vibration - the
tiniest misstep - could send them
both plunging to their death.

BACK TO GRAYSONS

Inching forward toward each other along the taut wire, using their
balancing poles for support.

ANGLE ON JOKER

All eyes are riveted on the Graysons.  The Joker opens the billowing
sleeve of his clown costume.  Popping out:  A LIVE FALCON.  It
hesitates, then takes off!

BACK TO GRAYSONS

They're face to face now, on the wire, preparing to pass each other
above the hushed Crowd.  Suddenly - the falcon flies into view, lands
heavily on one end of the male Grayson's pole with a SHRIEK!  The
surprised man teeters - the wire trembles - the falcon suddenly flies
at his face!  Both Grayson's tumble off the wire together, plummet
downward.

ANGLE ON DICK

As his parents hit the ground heavily in front of him.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND SILVER

Silver screams in horror.  Bruce stares unbelievingly.

ANGLE NEAR BIG CAT CAGE

Suddenly:  the Granny Clown standing by the big cat cage rips his mask
away!  The dress falls to the ground, revealing:

THE BATMAN!

QUICK CUTS

1. The Crowd gasps.

2. Bruce gapes in disbelief as Silver watches him.

3. Dick Grayson looks over from the bodies of his parents.

4. The Joker grins.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

The Batman stares coldly, speaks in a icily clear voice.

BATMAN
I've risked my life to help this
city.  I stood up for what I knew
was right because I thought you
people were willing to stand with
me.  Well, now you can pay for your
cowardice.  Now I don't care how
many have to die.

ANGLE ON BRUCE AND CROWD

An angry MURMURING rumbles through the Crowd.

CROWD #1
CROWD #2
		  Stop him!
Don't let him get away!

Bruce vaults into the aisle, lunges down the steps after the fake
Batman as:

CLOSE ON JOKER

The Joker takes off his huge clown nose, throws it into the arena - a
giant smoke bomb!

All over the arena, OTHER CLOWNS follow suit.  The big top has become a
scene of impenetrable chaos as:

THE FAKE BATMAN OPENS THE DOOR TO THE BIG CATS CAGE!  Lions, tigers, et
al., bound off their perches for freedom, rushing out of the cage to
the SCREAMS of the Crowd.

The fake Batman disappears into an enveloping wall of smoke.

ANGLE ON BRUCE

Knifing his way through the panicked Spectators, lunging through the
smoke after the fake Batman.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Silver stumbles after Bruce through the pandemonium, reaching the empty
cat cage, gasping for breath with teary eyes.

SILVER
Bruce...?  Bruce!

BACK TO BRUCE

Nearby.  Spotting her.  Eyes widening in horror!

BRUCE
Silver, look out!

ANGLE ON SILVER

A HUGE TIGER SNARLS, preparing to spring at her!  It launches itself
into mid-air as:

Bruce flies at Silver from the other direction, pulling her down to the
ground as the enormous cat sails over them, banging its head into the
cage bars, knocking itself senseless.

Bruce pulls Silver to her feet, wraps a protective arm around her,
leads her off through the smoky panic and confusion.

ANGLE ON DICK GRAYSON

Dick kneels protectively over the bodies of his parents, oblivious to
the insanity around him.  Spectators and Animals rush past in all
directions as he removes his aerialist's cape, then gently covers the
faces of his Mother and Father.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

CAMERA LOOKS DOWN on the aftermath.  Police cars and ambulances
everywhere.  Smoke still drifts from the big top.  Dazed PATRONS mill
around looking for lost family members.

ANGLE NEAR BIG TOP ENTRANCE

Silver emerges from a medical tent marked by a red cross, sporting a
heavily bandaged hand.  She spots Alfred and the Rolls Royce near the
entrance to the big top, walks over.

SILVER
The doctor says no more crap games
for a week or so, Alfred...
(stops; looks)
Where's Bruce?

ALFRED
(hesitantly)
Mr. Wayne wondered...if you'd be good
enough to let me drive you home.

SILVER
Drive me...

She looks off into the big top:

ANGLE ON BRUCE - HER P.O.V.

Bruce stands motionless in the dark shadows at one end of the tent.  He
stares across the arena:

ANGLE ON DICK - BRUCE'S P.O.V.

Dick Grayson sits alone in the corner, head bowed.

BACK TO BRUCE

Bruce's eyes are filled with tears.

BACK TO SILVER

Silver watches, somehow feeling the deep significance of the moment
without the specifics.  She turns to Alfred quietly, nods, gets in the
car.

INT. TENT - CLOSE ON DICK

Dick is slumped, his head still bowed.  Tears roll down his cheeks.
Suddenly - a dark shadow inches across his face, almost blacking it
out.  He looks up.

Bruce stands over him, peering down, looking deeply into him with a
mesmerizing stare.

BRUCE
What will you do now, son?

DICK
I...don't know.  They were my only
family.  I...I...

He bursts into tears.  Bruce grabs him, holds him tightly.

BRUCE
I know exactly how you feel, son.
You may not believe that - but I do.

Bruce gazes down darkly, almost hypnotically, his eyes revealing the
truth.  Dick looks up slowly, riveted.

Suddenly:  WE HEAR the sound of ANGRY MURMURING from a CROWD - then,
the RAPPING of a Judge's gavel, silencing them.

INT. GOTHAM COURTHOUSE - DAY

CAMERA PANS DOWN from the symbol of Justice with her scales, painted on
the Gotham Courthouse ceiling.

JUDGE (O.S.)
I find you guilty of wanton negli-
gence against society.  Of knowingly
causing the death of an innocent
human being.

A black-robbed JUDGE reads the verdict to a courthouse full of
SPECTATORS, but an empty defense table.  The witness chair is also
empty.  Alone at the prosecution table - Rupert Thorne.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Of usurping the authority of those
legally sworn in to uphold law and
order.  The time has come to be rid
of you and your reckless vigilantism.

Bruce and Gordon sit in the front row.  Bruce's eyes reveal more
emotion than he would care to.  The Judge turns to face the empty
witness chair.

JUDGE (CONT'D)
Batman - you have been tried in
absentia and found guilty of murder.
You are sentenced to death.
(looks)
Mayor Thorne...

Thorne rises, pompous and grave.

THORNE
Your Honor, this is a tragic day in
the history of Gotham.  A once-
admired champion of the people has
now become a threat to their very
existence.  A lethal weapon dealing
in indiscriminate death.  Therefore,
to prevent further carnage, I've in-
structed Commissioner Gordon and his
department to bring in the Batman by
whatever means necessary.

Thorne sits.  The stunned Spectators begin to murmur loudly.

GORDON
The Batman.  A killer.  Who'd
believe it...?
BRUCE
I still don't.

GORDON
Bruce I deal in facts.  And the simple
fact is - you're looking at one poor
sonofabitch who made a deal with the
devil.

Bruce stares blankly at the witness chair.  The Judge pounds his gavel
for silence.  CAMERA ZOOMS IN on the gavel.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SECOND COURTROOM - DAY

CAMERA PULLS BACK from another gavel rapping in another courtroom,
revealing the face of a more benign JUDGE.

JUDGE #2
...therefore, by the power invested
in this Court...

WIDER ANGLE

Bruce and Dick Grayson stand facing the Judge.

JUDGE #2
I hereby declare Richard Grayson to
be the legally designated ward of
Mr. Bruce Wayne.
(smiles)
And may I add in passing - you're a
very fortunate young man.

BRUCE
Thank you, Your Honor.  I'm aware of that.

JUDGE #2
I meant...

Bruce turns to Dick, grins broadly.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

The Rolls Royce pulls up in front of Wayne Manor.  Alfred hurries to
open the front door as Bruce and Dick exit the car.  Dick stares up at
the sprawling residence in awe.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

As Dick enters with Bruce:  the towering hallway of Wayne Manor is
filled with balloons and a banner reading:  ""WELCOME HOME, DICK.""
Silver grins down from the staircase.

Dick drinks it all in, slightly uneasy and embarrassed.  He wanders
into the enormous living room, unsure, visually adjusting himself to
his new, outsized life.

EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

CAMERA PANS ACROSS a fully outfitted trapeze and ring set on the lawn
of Wayne Manor.  Bruce gazes up proudly at it, looks over to Dick for
his reaction.

Dick looks up at the apparatus somewhat apprehensively, then flashes
Bruce a self-conscious smile.  Bruce understands, claps a hand on his
shoulder, leads him away.

EXT. POOLSIDE - DAY

Dick lies sunning himself on a chaise by the pool.  Suddenly, a large,
wet beach ball lands on his stomach.  He pops up, looks off toward the
pool:

Bruce and Silver laugh from inside the pool, gesture at Dick to come
and join them.  He gives them a half-hearted smile, shakes his head,
then tosses the ball back.

Silver looks at Bruce with concern.

INT. WAYNE MANOR DINING ROOM - DAY

Dick toys with his food at lunch, looks over nicely at Bruce who is
talking non-stop from across the table.

BRUCE
...later on we'll pick up Silver and
go to that new magic musical every-
one's talking about.  We can't stay
out too later - don't forget we've
for that doubleheader tomorrow...

DICK
Sounds great.

BRUCE
(pause)
Is something wrong, Dick?

Dick lowers his eyes, not wanting to respond.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
We're all trying just a little too
hard around here to make you feel at
home, right?

DICK
(with difficulty)
It's not that.  You've been wonder-
ful to me.  It's my fault you've
had to try so hard.  It's...
(eyes misting)
It's just that I still hurt so much
sometimes...and then I remember, and
I get so filled with...hate again.

BRUCE
Hate?

Dick's eyes harden.  His face sets with a cold look, not unlike that of
a young Bruce Wayne when he faced Joe Chill.

DICK
I made a promise to myself the day my
parents died.  A promise that someday
-- somehow - I'm going to keep.

Bruce's eyes flick over carefully.

BRUCE
What did you promise?

DICK
I'm going to kill the Batman.

There is a long silence.  Bruce smiles tentatively.

BRUCE
That's a pretty tall order.

DICK
We'll see.  I have the rest of my
life to get it done.

BRUCE
What if he's...skipped town?  Given
the whole thing up?  Died, even.  No
one ever knew who he was in the
first place.  You can't dedicate
your whole life to killing a ghost.

DICK
I thought you'd understand when you
told me how your parents were
killed.  Didn't you feel the same way?

BRUCE
(avoiding his gaze)
Well I was younger than you are,
and...

DICK
(pressing him)
Didn't you hate?  Didn't you want
to do something about it?

BRUCE
(pause)
Yes.  For a while.  But then I...
(looks down)
...realized how fruitless it was.

DICK
Well that's not going to happen to
me!

Dick rises from the table, looks over with total, piercing sincerity,
his eyes misting over again.

DICK (CONT'D)
Listen, I'm...grateful for every-
thing you've done for me - and for
all you intend to do.  But if you
can't live with my promise, accept
it, support it, even - then maybe
we've both made a mistake.
(eyes glistening)
May I be excused now?

Bruce stares back, deeply moved, almost whispers.

BRUCE
Yes.  Of course you can.

Dick hurries out the door.  Bruce grits his teeth, crumples up his
napkin, squeezing it into a tiny ball.

BRUCE (CONT'D)
Damn.

EXT. GOTHAM INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Rupert Thorne walks briskly down the street, hat tipped low over his
face, coat collar turned up against the night wind.  He arrives at a
deserted intersection, checks the cross street signs, then glances down
at his watch impatiently.

ANGLE ON SIDE OF BUILDING

Tucked under a high ledge of a nearby building:  a mounted camera lens
swivels, the moonlight glinting off its surface.

BACK TO THORNE

Rubbing his hands together.  Looking around at the empty streets,
irritated.

JOKER'S VOICE
You're late.

Thorne's head snaps around at he VOICE.  He sees nothing.

JOKER'S VOICE
We shouldn't be seen together any-
more, Mr. Mayor.  You can't afford
the risk.

Thorne stares:  the Joker's Voice is coming from inside a short,
standing mailbox on the corner.

Thorne hesitates, then slowly moves to the mailbox, tilts back the
letter slot, mutters, looking around nervously.

THORNE
I feel like a Goddamn idiot...

INT. JOKER'S LAIR - NIGHT

The Joker speaks into a microphone attached to a tiny transmitting set.

A VIDEO SCREEN above shows Thorne standing by the mailbox.

NOTE:  THIS SCENE TO BE INTERCUT AS REQUIRED:

JOKER
That's what I felt like twenty years
ago, Thorne.  When I decided to start
off your political career with a
""bang.""  Remember Thomas Wayne?

THORNE
(cold pause)
Every time I see his son.

JOKER
No regrets now, Mr. Mayor.  It's
taken me too long to maneuver us
into a position of total control in
this city.  I've got the judges
lined up, the public at your feet...
(cold pause)
You owe me, Rupert Thorne.

THORNE
It's a two-way street.  Once I
relieve Commissioner Gordon of his
duties, you'll have a free rein in
Gotham - less my cut.  And now that
it's legal to shoot the Batman...

JOKER
We have to find him first.  So far,
it's been like looking for a virgin
in a maternity ward.

THORNE
Then don't find him.  Let him find
You.

JOKER
How?  If the real Batman wouldn't
even appear at the opera to save the
Mayor...

THORNE
The Batman wasn't in love with the
Mayor.  He is in love...with a
certain young lady.  Or so she tells
me and I've never known her to lie.

JOKER
What is she, a mute?

THORNE
(deadly)
Careful.  You may be talking about
the future Mrs. Thorne.  I...want
you to kidnap her.

JOKER
Now take my wife - please...

THORNE
The girl is not to be harmed.  Once
you've killed Batman and made your
escape - I'll call the police and
rescue her.

JOKER
Her knight in shining armor.

THORNE
Something like that.

JOKER
I underestimated you, Thorne.  I always
knew you were corrupt, but I had no
idea you'd turn out to be such a
delightfully repellent human being.

The Joker cackles insanely.  Thorne spots someone coming, closes the
slot, hurries off.

After a beat, an ANCIENT WOMAN approaches the mailbox with a handful of
letters.  She lowers the slot.

JOKER'S VOICE
(outraged)
Do you mind?  I'll never get these
pictures developed!

The Woman SCREAMS!  Her letters go flying up in the air as she hustles
down the street.  The insane giggle of the Joker trails off into the
night.

INT. SILVER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Silver is dressed in a lacy, powder-blue slip, exits her dressing room,
combing her hair.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

SILVER
(crossing)
Who is it?

VOICE
(through door)
Gotham Florists, lady.  For a Miss
St. Cloud.

Silver looks through the peephole.

ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE

A DELIVERY BOY waits, head down, holding a bouquet.

BACK TO SCENE

Silver opens the doors slightly, sticks her arm out.  The Delivery Boy
thrusts the bouquet in her hand.

DELIVERY BOY
Say it with flowers...

SILVER
What a surprise!...

She inhales the aroma of the bouquet deeply.  Her eyes become glassy.
She drops to the floor.

DELIVERY BOY
What a straight man!

He swings the door open.  It is the Joker.

INT. POLICE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Thorne strides purposefully down the hallway, followed by a reluctant
Sergeant Haley.

HALEY
...I don't know, Your Honor.  I
mean, you're the Mayor and all that
-- but I work for the Commissioner.

THORNE
As of tomorrow morning, no one works
for the Commissioner.  I'm relieving
him of his duties.

They have arrived at Gordon's door.  Haley is shocked.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I assume you'll be staying on, Ser-
geant - as a loyal member of the
force?

HALEY
I...hope to, Sir.

THORNE
Then open it.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Haley's key opens the door.  They enter.  Thorne looks around, spots
the red phone connected to the Batcave.

THORNE
Anyone have the bright idea to run a
trace on this.

HALEY
Yes, sir.  First day it was installed.
But all we ever got back was an echo
of our own number.  Guy's amazing,
isn't he?

THORNE
Oh, he's a crafty one, all right.
Thanks, Haley.  That's all.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT

Dick Grayson descends the darkened staircase, dressed in his pajamas.
He hears a NOISE, sees a light coming from the study.

INT. WAYNE MANOR STUDY - NIGHT

Alfred is tidying up the study, turns as Dick appears.

DICK
All right if I make a sandwich in
the kitchen, Alfred?

ALFRED
Why certainly, Master Grayson.  If I
may be of help...

DICK
(grin)
I think I can handle it.  Thanks.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce sits at the computer, runs through a criminal history of the
Joker on the video screen.  He pauses, looks off.

ANGLE ON BATPHONE

The red Batphone lights up, then dies.  Lights up, then dies.

BACK TO BRUCE

Staring.  Unsure.

INT. WAYNE STUDY - NIGHT

Alfred reaches to turn off the desk lamp.  Suddenly, the light from the
lamp rises, then dies.  Rises, then dies.

INT. GORDON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Thorne sits, Batphone in hand, waits.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce crosses to the phone.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred presses the button under the desk.  The bottom drawer pops open.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce picks up the phone, listens.

BACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE

THORNE
Batman?
(no reply)
Batman - if you're there - this is
Mayor Rupert Thorne.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce listens silently, frowning.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred holds the extension, listens in as well.

BACK TO THORNE

NOTE:  THIS CONVERSATION TO BE INTERCUT BETWEEN THORNE, BRUCE, AND
ALFRED AS REQUIRED:

THORNE
This...isn't easy for me, Batman,
considering what I've said and done
where you're concerned.  But I love
Silver St. Cloud very much - and I
have reason to believe you do too.

Bruce and Alfred react in their respective locations.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I...dropped by to have a drink with
her tonight.  The door was open,
there were signs of a struggle, and
she was gone.  The Joker left a
playing card - addressed to you.

Bruce's face sets darkly.

THORNE (CONT'D)
""Dear Batman.  Crime fighters may come
and go, but I carry on in the Great
American Tradition of violence.  I'm
calling my little caper, Slaughter In
Silver.  Sorry I have to run now.
Write if you get work.""

Bruce's eyes narrow, thinking.  Thorne's voice begins to crack
emotionally over the phone.

THORNE (CONT'D)
I...don't know where they took her
...or why the note was left for you.
I only know that Silver means more
than my life to me, and I beg you to
find her and save her.  You're her
only chance, Batman, I...

Thorne's voice dies away theatrically.  He hangs up.

BACK TO BATCAVE

Bruce hangs up, stares coldly.  His jaw twitches.

BACK TO STUDY

Alfred hangs up in the study, worried.

BACK TO GORDON'S OFFICE

Thorne takes a deep breath, smiles, rises, exits.

INT. WAYNE MANOR KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dick has made his sandwich, closes the refrigerator door, starts off
for the hallway.

ANGLE ON HALLWAY ENTRANCE

Dick enters the dark hallway, starts for the stairs as he sees:

ANGLE ON ALFRED - HIS P.O.V.

Alfred rushes out of the study, heading for the living room.  He slips,
falls heavily, picks himself up, oblivious to the pain, rushes into the
living room.

BACK TO DICK

Watching.  He starts for the stairs, then stops, now curiously heads
for the living room himself.

INT. WAYNE MANOR LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Dick enters, look around in amazement:  Alfred is nowhere to be seen!
His eyes scan the room for any other exit.

ANGLE ON GRANDFATHER CLOCK - DICK'S P.O.V.

The tall grandfather clock stands against one wall.  A thin shaft of
light seems to be emanating from behind it.

Dick advances to the clock, looks down, puzzled.  It seems to be
standing at a slight angle away from the wall.  Exploring the edge of
the clock with his hand, he starts to pull back.  The clock swivels,
revealing:

ANGLE DOWN INTO BATCAVE - DICK'S P.O.V.

The Batcave - with all its trophies, computers - in all its regal
splendor.  Alfred is standing near the gleaming Batmobile, looks off
with concern.

Now emerging from the shadows - THE BATMAN!  Dressed in his full
regalia, heading quickly toward Alfred and the Batmobile.

BACK TO DICK

Staring down, his jaw slack.  Stunned.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Batman crosses to Alfred, who stares with deadly concern.

ALFRED
Don't go, Sir.

BATMAN
Please get out of my way, Alfred.

ALFRED
Since when have you trusted Rupert
Thorne?  You don't even know where
you're meant to be going.

BATMAN
The clues in the note were obvious.
The ""Great American Tradition"" line?
That's the name of this year's series
of exhibits at the Gotham Museum.
And ""Write if you get work""?  This
month it's on American writers and
Writing.

ALFRED
If the clues are that obvious, they
must want you to come.  It's a
trap, can't you see that?

BATMAN
That boy up there thinks the Batman
killed his parents.  I told him he
couldn't live his whole life chasing
a ghost.  What I realize now is - I
can't live the rest of my life
being a ghost.

BACK TO DICK

Listening at the top of the stairs.  Thunderstruck.

BACK TO BATMAN

Batman puts an arm on Alfred's shoulder.

BATMAN
If I come back, old friend, I'll
explain things to Dick.  Tell him
the truth and have the Joker to
prove it.
(pause)
And if I don't - take care of him,
Alfred.  He'll be in much better
hands than he has been in mine.

Alfred silently steps aside as Batman enters the Batmobile, roars off
through the cave.

Alfred pauses sadly, then turns back, heading for the staircase again.
He looks up.

ANGLE ON DICK - ALFRED'S P.O.V.

Dick stands at the top of the stairs, staring down, grimly determined,
his face carved in granite.

EXT. GOTHAM ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Batman's silhouette as he leaps and glides effortlessly across the tops
of buildings.

EXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - NIGHT

The deserted museum with the billboard:  GREAT AMERICAN TRADITIONS.
This month:  American Writers and Writing.

EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

The museum roof is a network of vaulted glass skylights.  TWO THUGS
stand on a surrounding catwalk.

CLOSE ON CATWALK

A sharp metallic ""ping"" is heard across the catwalk.

BACK TO SCENE

The Thugs look up.  One pulls a gun.

THUG
The Batman...

BATMAN'S VOICE
Count on it.

They wheel.  Batman stands directly behind them.  He grabs the first
Thug, swivels him as the second Thug fires - killing his partner.
Batman shoves the dead man into the second Thug, as both bodies crash
down through the glass skylight.

INT. MUSEUM - UP ANGLE - NIGHT

The bodies explode through the glass, falling some sixty feet to the
floor.  Then - total silence.

BACK TO BATMAN

Staring down through the broken glass.  Listening.  He pulls a tiny
revolver from his belt.  A barbed metal dart sticks out of the barrel.
Batman aims it through the hole, fires.

ANGLE ON MUSEUM RAFTERS

The dart embeds itself deeply into a rafter.  Attached to it is a white
nylon cord.

BACK TO BATMAN

Securing the other end of the cord.  He hooks himself to it with a
clip, glides through the opening in the glass.

BACK TO RAFTERS

Batman shoots silently along the cord to a rafter, lands gracefully,
looks down.

ANGLE DOWN ON MUSEUM - HIS P.O.V.

Through the dim, eerie light.  This exhibit (like the one including the
giant penny) consists of huge, outsized version of everyday items.  In
this case - the tools of a writer's trade:  enormous pencils, erasers,
quill pens, fountain pens, ink wells, a ten-foot-high pencil sharpener,
tall volumes of famous American novels, etc.

In the center of the display - a giant electric typewriter, some thirty
feet wide.  A huge sheet of blank white paper is rolled up on it.

BACK TO BATMAN

Staring down curiously through the silent darkness.  His gaze starts to
wander, then suddenly spots something.

BACK TO TYPEWRITER

A FIGURE attached to the typewriter now moves.  It is Silver, hooked
onto the ribbon near the center of the page.  She moans, still
recovering from the effects of the drugs.

BACK TO BATMAN

Eyes widening.  He hooks one end of a nylon cord to a rafter, launches
himself, swinging down toward Silver.

BACK TO RAFTER

A hand with a knife reaches out, slices through the cord!

BACK TO BATMAN

Now plummeting like a rock.  He falls into the typewriter in front of
Silver, his cape suddenly catching on something, partially ripping it,
jerking him to a stop.

WIDER ANGLE

The lights are turned on.  Emerging from behind or under the various
exhibits:  thirty or forty GOONS.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

Batman hangs helplessly from the circular element ball which prints out
the characters on the page.  His cape is caught on the projected edge
of one of the giant letters.  He stares ahead, unable to extricate
himself.

ANGLE ON SILVER

The glaring lights have brought Silver back to consciousness.  Hooked
to the huge ribbon near the center of the page, she suddenly spots
Batman across from her.

SILVER
(horrified)
Oh, my God...

WIDER ANGLE

Stepping out onto the end of the carriage - the Joker!

JOKER
I knew you'd drop in, Batman.
You're that type of guy.
(insane giggle)
Get it?  Type?

The forty Goons circle in around the typewriter.  The Joker nods to two
of them.

CLOSE ON SWITCH

Two Goons give a mighty heave, flip the ""ON"" lever.  A loud hum is
heard as the typewriter activates.

ANGLE ON THORNE

Rupert Thorne hides in the shadows behind a large pencil box, watches
the scene.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
You know, you're nothing to write
home about, Batman - but let's give
it a try.

The Joker points a gun down at the keyboard.

JOKER
What letter could be hiding under
your cape?  A ""D', maybe?

The Joker fires:

CLOSE ON LETTER ""D""

The bullet hits the letter ""D"", depressing it.

CLOSE ON BATMAN

The element ball carrying Batman shifts, hurtles toward the page with
blinding speed.  It ""cracks"" against the paper sharply, imprinting a
""D"".  Batman's head has stopped mere inches from the page.

ANGLE ON SILVER

Eyes welded shut - terrified.  The printing of the letter has advanced
the ribbon.  She is perilously close to the exact center of the page.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
Not the ""D"".  Hmm.  The most common
letter is ""E""...

BACK TO BATMAN

The Joker fires!  Batman flies toward the page, this time nearly
squashed on the other side.  A giant ""E"" has been imprinted.  Silver
advances one more position on the ribbon.

JOKER (CONT'D)
An ""A"", maybe...

The element ball spins, hurtles toward the paper again.  It splats into
the page, narrowly missing Batman, pushing Silver along again.
Immediately - another shot - the ball whizzes back, prints another ""D"".

JOKER (CONT'D)
I know I tried the ""D"" before, but I
simply couldn't resist.

WIDER ANGLE

The message on the page reads ""DEAD"".  The trembling Silver is only one
letter away from being obliterated.

BACK TO BATMAN

Struggling, but helpless.  His eyes flash nervously.

BACK TO THORNE

Alarmed as he sees what could happen to Silver.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
I know what letter is hidden under
your cape, by the way.  It's ""B"" -
for Batman.  But you see, I've got a
problem.  If I hit the letter ""B"",
Miss St. Cloud will die, and I pro-
mised not to kill her.

BACK TO THORNE

Grim.  Pulling a gun.

BACK TO JOKER

JOKER
To ""B"" or not to ""B""...That seems to
be the question.  Well, I suppose
promises - like laws - are made to
be broken.

VOICE
I made a promise, too, Joker.  The
night you killed my parents.

QUICK CUTS:

Thorne looks up.  Silver looks up.  Batman looks up.  The Joker looks
up.

ANGLE ON ROBIN - THEIR P.O.V.

Dick Grayson stands high in the rafters.

DICK
I promised to wipe filthy crud like
you off the face of the earth.

JOKER'S VOICE
Shoot him!

There is a hail of gunfire as Dick flies down through the air toward
the typewriter.

Dick lands on the ""TAB"" key.  The carriage releases, shoots across the
typewriter, carrying the Joker with it.  He flies off the end, crashes
sickeningly into the wall, drops to the floor, unconscious.

Dick bounces off the ""TAB"", flies across the keyboard, lands on the
""SHIFT"" key.

DICK
That ought to give you a lift,
Batman!

ANGLE ON BATMAN

The ""SHIFT"" swivels the element ball 180-degress to expose the capital
letters.  Batman is swung to the front, grabs the carriage, pulls
himself up, looks down as Dick launches himself into a pile of Goons
like a human dynamo.

BATMAN
Leave a few for me, son!

Batman leaps off the carriage, joins Dick in the fray.

NOTE:  The fight which follows will be outrageous and thrilling, but
should look physically believable.  The Dynamic Duo will overpower the
gang using the following elements and devices:

A. Dick flinging Goons back into the pointed tips of quill pens.

B. Batman lifting a fountain pen lever, firing a river of ink at an
onrushing group.

C. Both of them using springy, huge erasers as launching platforms.

D. Oversized volumes of literature slamming shut on the villains.

E. Enormous bookmarks and letter openers swung as clubs, knocking out
three or four crooks at a time.

F. Heavies being hurled into huge, deep ink wells, turning them sopping
black wet, unable to climb out again.

G. Dick bashing a pair of Thugs back into the side of the giant pencil
sharpener.  They slam back against the ""ON"" button, activating it.

During the chaos, Rupert Thorne has made his way down the typewriter's
steel bar which holds the paper to the roller.  He unhooks Silver,
lifts her to safety.

SILVER
Rupert?  What...

THORNE
Don't talk.  Let's go.

The fight continues as Rupert and Silver run down the bar, drop off the
typewriter, cross the floor through the furious melee, heading for the
door.  Batman rounds the corner of a giant book.  Silver spots him,
stops.

SILVER
Batman?...Batman!...

Thorne yanks at her.  She tries to pull away, sees two Goons coming up
behind Batman.

SILVER
Bruce!  Look out!

Batman ducks, rolls, trips the Goons, knocks their heads together.
Silver rushes toward him as Thorne pulls a gun, realizing.

THORNE
Bruce...Bruce Wayne...

BATMAN
Silver!  Get away!

Dick has bashed a Goon backwards - he careens across the floor, hits
Silver from the side, knocking her into Batman as Thorne fires.

CLOSE ON SILVER

Blood spurts quickly across the lacy back of Silver's powder-blue slip.
Batman hooks an arm around her, stares into her dying face, struck
dumb.

SILVER
(trembling)
I'm...right...aren't I...Bruce.

ANGLE ON THORNE

Horrified.  He turns, runs.

ANGLE ON DICK

Giving chase.  Dodging bullets as Thorne fires at him.

BACK TO BATMAN

Lowering Silver to the floor.  She's barely breathing.  Thorne's
gunfire echoes through the museum.  Batman's jaw twitches.  His eyes
flash with rage.

ANGLE ON DICK

Dick rounds the corner of a giant prop some ten feet high off the
floor.  Thorne waits for him on the next prop - gun poised and ready.
Dick spots him, freezes.

THORNE
I don't know what part you play in
all this, kid.  But it's turned out
to be a one-night stand.

BATMAN'S VOICE
(roaring with rage)
May God damn you, Rupert Thorne!

BACK TO BATMAN

Batman has placed a huge, viciously sharp thumbtack in a giant rubber
band pulled taut.  He lets it fly.

ANGLE ON THORNE

The thumbtack spears Thorne in the chest, topples him back across the
prop - which is the giant pencil sharpener - he falls into the hole:  A
disappearing scream is cut short as Thorne is ground to death.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman kneels, cradles Silver's head in his lap.  Her eyes flutter open
painfully.  She tries to smile.

SILVER
Hello...Bruce...

He stares down, eyes filled with tears.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Maybe...it's better, you know?
I'd...just...get in the way...

BATMAN
(low whisper)
Don't...

SILVER
I could...never really have you, and
...I could never fall in love with
someone else.

Her eyelids tremble.  One of his tears hits her cheek softly.  She
reaches up, gently caresses his chin.

SILVER (CONT'D)
Poor...darling...you're the one...
who's...left behind...

Her eyes close.  Her face relaxes, dead.  Tears stream heavily down
Batman's cowl.

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

Commissioner Gordon supervises the aftermath and cleanup,  The Joker,
still groggy, handcuffed, is yanked along by a COP.

JOKER
Take it easy, okay?  I get winded
opening clams.

He is led away.  Gordon stares across the room.

ANGLE ON BATMAN

Batman stands by Silver's body which has been placed on a gurney.  TWO
PARAMEDICS cover her face with a blanket.

BATMAN
Wait.

They stop.  He reaches in, pulls back the blanket, stares down at her
face.  Gordon has crossed to join him.

GORDON
What a Goddamn shame.  You know
who's going to be really broken up
about this - Bruce Wayne.

Batman turns, glances at Gordon blankly.

GORDON (CONT'D)
They were real close, you know.  Or
maybe you didn't.

Gordon turns, paces thoughtfully.

GORDON (CONT'D)
But at least you're back, I'm
back, and all's right with this
crazy world for a second.  Now I
don't know where the hell this kid
they're talking about went to,
but...

He turns, looks.  Batman has disappeared.

EXT. GOTHAM MUSEUM - DAWN

The gurney carrying Silver's body is loaded into an ambulance.  It
takes off, red lights flashing, siren wailing.  The rising sun is just
beginning to crack the clouds on the horizon.  CAMERA WIDENS, STARTS TO
RISE:

The ambulance becomes a tiny red dot as we now view the magnificent
downtown section of Gotham.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO RISE, SHOOTING UP some eighty stories, then ninety,
then one hundred, finally revealing:

WE DISSOLVE AS:

The dark, majestic figure of the Batman, standing on the top edge of
the tallest building in Gotham.  He looks down silently, cape billowing
out behind him, a regal black prince surveying his steel and concrete
realm.

Now swinging up and across from a nearby lower building:

THE IMPOSING, GRIM-FACED, COLORFUL FIGURE OF ROBIN!  Dressed in his
green shirt, red vest, flowing yellow cape and black mask, he lands on
the roof noiselessly.

Batman's eyes acknowledge his presence without turning.  Robin
advances, then stops silently, several paces behind.

The DYNAMIC DUO has been joined.  Both for now, and for the future
adventures which await them in Gotham.

FADE TO BLACK.

Nor can she ask him

I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, ""back at ya""
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, ""hello, hello""
Up against the wall like, ""let's go, let's go""

If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

[Verse 2]
If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, ""shut up boy, you bananas!""
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, ""hello, hello""
Up against the wall like, ""let's go, let's go""

Slash the anger from my gun crucify you bitches like Jesus

And some of us even try to get sober
Now here's to the assholes and the last calls
We're city kids
You get what you ask for

[Pre-Hook: Macklemore]

I hope those friends they remember me
Hold the night for ransom as we kidnap the memories
Not sure there is a way to express what you meant to me
Sit around a table and use those years as the centrepiece

Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR
Sounds of the city on Capitol Hill
Where I question if what I'm seeing here is real
Cowboy boots doing lines at the bar
Where the time goes slow when you're drinking PBR

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Hold on to what you were, forget what you're not
The streets were ours that summer
At least those two blocks
Reminisce on those days
I guess that's OK, you wonder why
Some grow up, move on
Close the chapter
Live separate lives
The twenty-something confusion before the suit and tie
Strangers become mistakes
But those mistakes made you feel alive
Hindsight is vibrant, reality
Rarely lit
Memories, a collage pasted with glue that barely sticks
Good Lord, they broke all my shields
Locked bathroom doors
Graffiti and high heels
Until you felt that altitude you don't know how high feels
Party mountain
Some don't ever come down from around here
To be young again
I guess it's relative
The Camel Lights
The whiskey, ryes
Sink into the skin
I fantasize about a second wind
Grow a moustache
Pick up another bad habit and let the games begin

So here's to the nights
Dancing with the band
Strangers into girlfriends from a one night stand
Poor out a little liquor and turn up the Johnny Cash
You could bring a receipt to Heaven but you cannot take it back
And this is life, this is real
Even when it feels like it isn't
I'd be a goddamn liar to say at times I didn't miss it
So deuces, I turn my back as I walk into the distance
Dip my feet in every once in a while
Just to say I visit

[Bridge: Macklemore]
And we hold onto these nights
Trying to find our way home by the street light
Over time we figure out this is me, right
Learn a lot about your friends right around two A.M

239,"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh! (A Letter From Camp)","Hello Muddah, hello Faddah
Here I am at Camp Granada
Camp is very entertaining
And they say we'll have some fun if it stops raining

I went hiking with Joe Spivy
He developed poison ivy
You'll remember Leonard Skinner
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner

All the counsellors hate the waiters
And the lake has alligators
And the head coach wants no sissies
So he reads to us from something called Ulysses

How I don't want this should scare ya
But my bunkmate has malaria
You'll remember Jeffrey Hardy
They're about to organize a searching party

Take me home, oh muddah, faddah
Take me home, I hate Granada
Don't leave me out in the forest where
I might get eaten by a bear

Take me home, I promise I will not make noise
Or mess the house with other boys
Oh please don't make me stay
I've been here one whole day

Dearest Faddah, darling Muddah
How's my precious little bruddah
Let me come home if you miss me
I would even let Aunt Bertha hug and kiss me

Wait a minute, it's stopped hailing
Guys are swimming, guys are sailing
Playing baseball, gee that's better

My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong

Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was toting' a .44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong

And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong

Why you speed ball with cards, that's invalid

Cruise in my Lexus Land with no mileage
While you walk the street until your feet get calloused
Take you on a natural high, like a pilot

It's my diner, I'm Mel, and you're Alice
Spend a night, in Lil' Cease palace

Shall I proceed? (Yes indeed!)
I'ma throw shade if I can't get paid
Blow you up to your girl like the Army grenade
You can slide on my ice like the Escapade
And itchy-gitchy-yaya with the marmalade

249,That's How It Goes,"[Verse 1]
Yo, I remember days when niggas ain't fuck with me
Dropped that mixtape, that was the first time they noticed me
Mama always told me be the fuck who you supposed to be to be and never claim the streets
Cause you would die tryna reach a peak
So I rep that Westside, no place that I'd rather be
Where niggas stick they chest out until you pull out that heat
Hoes got they breasts out, blame it on summer heat
On the corner tricking 'cause the kids ain't got shit to eat
""Only God can judge me"" in her head is what she repeat
Shit, get it how you life, shawty, college don't come cheap
They laying everybody off, it's hard to make ends meet
Unemployment tripping, rent due in about a week
Told her oldest son ""you too old to be rhymin' beats""
Told her youngest son ""we too poor to waste time on dreams, so get up off your ass, find you a J-O-B""
While his step-dad on the couch and he sound asleep
Never just a soul, nobody different than you and me
Behind closed doors ain't no tellin' what niggas see

[Pre-Hook]
I do this for you and me, drop classics on classic beats
Just trying to spread love and peace, but I'm strapped cause they packin' heat, shit

[Verse 2]
I remember days, she wouldn't get close to me
A hundred plays was the first time she noticed me
She said ""I like your rhymes and how you approached to me""
Don't talk about smoking weed, I like that shit so to speak
Appreciate the love, didn't notice you noticed me
Just tryna hold it down, be the best that I'd every be
So claimed to be my friends, they ain't know me before the beat
Back when I just the lil' nigga across the street, they tried to take my shoes
They ain't taking my shit from me
Ran straight home from school, grab that 2', don't fuck with me
Pops wasn't around, my oldest brother did shit for me
Like, teach me how to box a nigga up if he fuck with me
So my mama moved across that way 'cause she heard
That we don't get along with half the niggas from up the street
Load the Jeaps and U-Hauls and off that we go to see
A fresh start played a part in how I own the beat
Take a seat, let the top drop down so I can see
Every last obstacle that God left ahead of me

All through the week
I miss you so
But, now that I've got you
I'm gonna hold you closer and closer and closer

I don't wanna go out walking with you
And now that I am in this trance
I don't even know if I'll talk to you
I just wanna stay here and (I wanna love you, I wanna love you, I......)

256,The Lonely Surfer,"I was driving up the beach the other day
Up the Pacific Coast Highway
It was a little past sunset
And I could see it was going to be a full moon
A couple of guys were out there making their last runs of the day
Man, it was tube city! You know, like the Green Cathedral?
So I pulled over to take a look
The waves were a little gnarly, yeah really bitchin'
So I got out and took a walk along the beach
But, you know, I was thinking of you
Ah...

And as I walked a little further along the shore
I looked up and saw a lonely gull make its way back home
As I kept walking along
I saw a couple getting close, very, very close
By a campfire
And as I looked out across the ocean
I thought about how every day
The tide takes those waves away from the shore
But, just like you my darling, they'll come back
Yeah, they'll come back
Back again once more

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Save those lies, darling don't explain
I recall Central Park in fall
How you tore your dress, what a mess, I confess

Danke schoen, darling, danke schoen
Thank you for walks down Lover's Lane
I can see, hearts carved on a tree
Letters intertwined, for all time
Yours and mine, that was fine

Thank you for seeing me again
Though we go on our separate ways

All that's left of all our love now
Is just your picture, eight by ten

My lonely world is only eight by ten eight by ten eight by ten
I remember the night that you gave me that picture I ought to
I've relived it so many times I remember how I couldn't wait to get home
Put it in a frame and tell everybody that you were mine

Because you were mine at least until someone else came along
And took you off out of my sight
It's a good thing that you did leave me your picture to hold
Because now I can cry on your shoulder every night

(Eight by ten eight by ten)
My lonely world is only eight by ten

It's awful to be jealous of an old picture frame
But I'm jealous of anything that's close to you
And that picture frame seems to be holding you pretty tight
That looks like more than I'll ever do

I wish that I could just be the glass in that frame
And be so close to the lips that I love
I am glad that I've at least got your picture to hold

261,China Nights (Shina No Yoru),"The NELLIE, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide

The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth

The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom

Between us there was, as I have already said somewhere, the bond of the sea. Besides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation, it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other's yarns -- and even convictions. The Lawyer -- the best of old fellows -- had, because of his many years and many virtues the only cushion on deck, and was lying on the only rug. The Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes, and was toying architecturally with the bones. Marlow sat cross-legged right aft, leaning against the mizzen-mast. He had sunken cheeks, a yellow complexion, a straight back, an ascetic aspect, and, with his arms dropped, the palms of hands outwards, resembled an idol. The director, satisfied the anchor had good hold, made his way aft and sat down amongst us. We exchanged a few words lazily. Afterwards there was silence on board the yacht. For some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes. We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring. The day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance. The water shone pacifically; the sky, without a speck, was a benign immensity of unstained light; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric, hung from the wooded rises inland, and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds. Only the gloom to the west, brooding over the upper reaches, became more sombre every minute, as if angered by the approach of the sun

And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall, the sun sank low, and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat, as if about to go out suddenly, stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men

Forthwith a change came over the waters, and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound. The old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day, after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks, spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth. We looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever, but in the august light of abiding memories. And indeed nothing is easier for a man who has, as the phrase goes, ""followed the sea"" with reverence and affection, that to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames. The tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service, crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea. It had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud, from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin, knights all, titled and untitled -- the great knights-errant of the sea. It had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time, from the GOLDEN HIND returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure, to be visited by the Queen's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale, to the EREBUS and TERROR, bound on other conquests -- and that never returned. It had known the ships and the men. They had sailed from Deptford, from Greenwich, from Erith -- the adventurers and the settlers; kings' ships and the ships of men on 'Change; captains, admirals, the dark ""interlopers"" of the Eastern trade, and the commissioned ""generals"" of East India fleets. Hunters for gold or pursuers of fame, they all had gone out on that stream, bearing the sword, and often the torch, messengers of the might within the land, bearers of a spark from the sacred fire. What greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth! . . . The dreams of men, the seed of commonwealths, the germs of empires

The sun set; the dusk fell on the stream, and lights began to appear along the shore. The Chapman light-house, a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat, shone strongly. Lights of ships moved in the fairway -- a great stir of lights going up and going down. And farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky, a brooding gloom in sunshine, a lurid glare under the stars

""And this also,"" said Marlow suddenly, ""has been one of the dark places of the earth.""

He was the only man of us who still ""followed the sea."" The worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class. He was a seaman, but he was a wanderer, too, while most seamen lead, if one may so express it, a sedentary life. Their minds are of the stay-at-home order, and their home is always with them -- the ship; and so is their country -- the sea. One ship is very much like another, and the sea is always the same. In the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores, the foreign faces, the changing immensity of life, glide past, veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself, which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny. For the rest, after his hours of work, a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent, and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing. The yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity, the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut. But Marlow was not typical (if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted), and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside, enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze, in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine

His remark did not seem at all surprising. It was just like Marlow. It was accepted in silence. No one took the trouble to grunt even; and presently he said, very slow --

""I was thinking of very old times, when the Romans first came here, nineteen hundred years ago -- the other day. . . . Light came out of this river since -- you say Knights? Yes; but it is like a running blaze on a plain, like a flash of lightning in the clouds. We live in the flicker -- may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling! But darkness was here yesterday. Imagine the feelings of a commander of a fine -- what d'ye call 'em? -- trireme in the Mediterranean, ordered suddenly to the north; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries -- a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been, too -- used to build, apparently by the hundred, in a month or two, if we may believe what we read. Imagine him here -- the very end of the world, a sea the colour of lead, a sky the colour of smoke, a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina -- and going up this river with stores, or orders, or what you like. Sand-banks, marshes, forests, savages, -- precious little to eat fit for a civilized man, nothing but Thames water to drink. No Falernian wine here, no going ashore. Here and there a military camp lost in a wilderness, like a needle in a bundle of hay -- cold, fog, tempests, disease, exile, and death -- death skulking in the air, in the water, in the bush. They must have been dying like flies here. Oh, yes -- he did it. Did it very well, too, no doubt, and without thinking much about it either, except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time, perhaps. They were men enough to face the darkness. And perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by and by, if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate. Or think of a decent young citizen in a toga -- perhaps too much dice, you know -- coming out here in the train of some prefect, or tax-gatherer, or trader even, to mend his fortunes. Land in a swamp, march through the woods, and in some inland post feel the savagery, the utter savagery, had closed round him -- all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest, in the jungles, in the hearts of wild men. There's no initiation either into such mysteries. He has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible, which is also detestable. And it has a fascination, too, that goes to work upon him. The fascination of the abomination -- you know, imagine the growing regrets, the longing to escape, the powerless disgust, the surrender, the hate.""

He paused

""Mind,"" he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a lotus-flower -- ""Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What saves us is efficiency -- the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect. They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force -- nothing to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at it blind -- as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much. What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a sentimental pretence but an idea; and an Unselfish belief in the idea -- something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a sacrifice to. . . .""

He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each other -- then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We looked on, waiting patiently -- there was nothing else to do till the end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he said, in a hesitating voice, ""I suppose you fellows remember I did once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit,"" that we knew we were fated, before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow's inconclusive experiences

""I don't want to bother you much with what happened to me personally,"" he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience would like best to hear; ""yet to understand the effect of it on me you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went up that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything about me -- and into my thoughts. It was sombre enough, too -- and pitiful -- not extraordinary in any way -- not very clear either. No, not very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light

""I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas -- a regular dose of the East -- six years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship -- I should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn't even look at me. And I got tired of that game, too

""Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put my finger on it and say, 'When I grow up I will go there.' The North Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I haven't been there yet, and shall not try now. The glamour's off. Other places were scattered about the hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and . . . well, we won't talk about that. But there was one yet -- the biggest, the most blank, so to speak -- that I had a hankering after.

""True, by this time it was not a blank space any more. It had got filled since my boyhood with rivers and lakes and names. It had ceased to be a blank space of delightful mystery -- a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird -- a silly little bird. Then I remembered there was a big concern, a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water -- steamboats! Why shouldn't I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me

""You understand it was a Continental concern, that Trading society; but I have a lot of relations living on the Continent, because it's cheap and not so nasty as it looks, they say

""I am sorry to own I began to worry them. This was already a fresh departure for me. I was not used to get things that way, you know. I always went my own road and on my own legs where I had a mind to go. I wouldn't have believed it of myself; but, then -- you see -- I felt somehow I must get there by hook or by crook. So I worried them. The men said 'My dear fellow,' and did nothing. Then -- would you believe it? -- I tried the women. I, Charlie Marlow, set the women to work -- to get a job. Heavens! Well, you see, the notion drove me. I had an aunt, a dear enthusiastic soul. She wrote: 'It will be delightful. I am ready to do anything, anything for you. It is a glorious idea. I know the wife of a very high personage in the Administration, and also a man who has lots of influence with,' etc. She was determined to make no end of fuss to get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy

""I got my appointment -- of course; and I got it very quick. It appears the Company had received news that one of their captains had been killed in a scuffle with the natives. This was my chance, and it made me the more anxious to go. It was only months and months afterwards, when I made the attempt to recover what was left of the body, that I heard the original quarrel arose from a misunderstanding about some hens. Yes, two black hens. Fresleven -- that was the fellow's name, a Dane -- thought himself wronged somehow in the bargain, so he went ashore and started to hammer the chief of the village with a stick. Oh, it didn't surprise me in the least to hear this, and at the same time to be told that Fresleven was the gentlest, quietest creature that ever walked on two legs. No doubt he was; but he had been a couple of years already out there engaged in the noble cause, you know, and he probably felt the need at last of asserting his self-respect in some way. Therefore he whacked the old nigger mercilessly, while a big crowd of his people watched him, thunderstruck, till some man -- I was told the chief's son -- in desperation at hearing the old chap yell, made a tentative jab with a spear at the white man -- and of course it went quite easy between the shoulder-blades. Then the whole population cleared into the forest, expecting all kinds of calamities to happen, while, on the other hand, the steamer Fresleven commanded left also in a bad panic, in charge of the engineer, I believe. Afterwards nobody seemed to trouble much about Fresleven's remains, till I got out and stepped into his shoes. I couldn't let it rest, though; but when an opportunity offered at last to meet my predecessor, the grass growing through his ribs was tall enough to hide his bones. They were all there. The supernatural being had not been touched after he fell. And the village was deserted, the huts gaped black, rotting, all askew within the fallen enclosures. A calamity had come to it, sure enough. The people had vanished. Mad terror had scattered them, men, women, and children, through the bush, and they had never returned. What became of the hens I don't know either. I should think the cause of progress got them, anyhow. However, through this glorious affair I got my appointment, before I had fairly begun to hope for it.

""I flew around like mad to get ready, and before forty-eight hours I was crossing the Channel to show myself to my employers, and sign the contract. In a very few hours I arrived in a city that always makes me think of a whited sepulchre. Prejudice no doubt. I had no difficulty in finding the Company's offices. It was the biggest thing in the town, and everybody I met was full of it. They were going to run an over-sea empire, and make no end of coin by trade

""A narrow and deserted street in deep shadow, high houses, innumerable windows with venetian blinds, a dead silence, grass sprouting right and left, immense double doors standing ponderously ajar. I slipped through one of these cracks, went up a swept and ungarnished staircase, as arid as a desert, and opened the first door I came to. Two women, one fat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool. The slim one got up and walked straight at me -- still knitting with down-cast eyes -- and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way, as you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. Her dress was as plain as an umbrella-cover, and she turned round without a word and preceded me into a waiting-room. I gave my name, and looked about. Deal table in the middle, plain chairs all round the walls, on one end a large shining map, marked with all the colours of a rainbow. There was a vast amount of red -- good to see at any time, because one knows that some real work is done in there, a deuce of a lot of blue, a little green, smears of orange, and, on the East Coast, a purple patch, to show where the jolly pioneers of progress drink the jolly lager-beer. However, I wasn't going into any of these. I was going into the yellow. Dead in the centre. And the river was there -- fascinating -- deadly -- like a snake. Ough! A door opened a white-haired secretarial head, but wearing a compassionate expression, appeared, and a skinny forefinger beckoned me into the sanctuary. Its light was dim, and a heavy writing-desk squatted in the middle. From behind that structure came out an impression of pale plumpness in a frock-coat. The great man himself. He was five feet six, I should judge, and had his grip on the handle-end of ever so many millions. He shook hands, I fancy, murmured vaguely, was satisfied with my French. BON VOYAGE.

""In about forty-five seconds I found myself again in the waiting-room with the compassionate secretary, who, full of desolation and sympathy, made me sign some document. I believe I undertook amongst other things not to disclose any trade secrets. Well, I am not going to

""I began to feel slightly uneasy. You know I am not used to such ceremonies, and there was something ominous in the atmosphere. It was just as though I had been let into some conspiracy -- I don't know -- something not quite right; and I was glad to get out. In the outer room the two women knitted black wool feverishly. People were arriving, and the younger one was walking back and forth introducing them. The old one sat on her chair. Her flat cloth slippers were propped up on a foot-warmer, and a cat reposed on her lap. She wore a starched white affair on her head, had a wart on one cheek, and silver-rimmed spectacles hung on the tip of her nose. She glanced at me above the glasses. The swift and indifferent placidity of that look troubled me. Two youths with foolish and cheery countenances were being piloted over, and she threw at them the same quick glance of unconcerned wisdom. She seemed to know all about them and about me, too. An eerie feeling came over me. She seemed uncanny and fateful. Often far away there I thought of these two, guarding the door of Darkness, knitting black wool as for a warm pall, one introducing, introducing continuously to the unknown, the other scrutinizing the cheery and foolish faces with unconcerned old eyes. AVE! Old knitter of black wool. MORITURI TE SALUTANT. Not many of those she looked at ever saw her again -- not half, by a long way

""There was yet a visit to the doctor. 'A simple formality,'assured me the secretary, with an air of taking an immense part in all my sorrows. Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose -- there must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead -- came from somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with inkstains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a little too early for the doctor, so I proposed a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our vermouths he glorified the Company's business, and by and by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once. 'I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples,' he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.

""The old doctor felt my pulse, evidently thinking of something else the while. 'Good, good for there,' he mumbled, and then with a certain eagerness asked me whether I would let him measure my head. Rather surprised, I said Yes, when he produced a thing like calipers and got the dimensions back and front and every way, taking notes carefully. He was an unshaven little man in a threadbare coat like a gaberdine, with his feet in slippers, and I thought him a harmless fool. 'I always ask leave, in the interests of science, to measure the crania of those going out there,' he said. 'And when they come back, too?' I asked. 'Oh, I never see them,' he remarked; 'and, moreover, the changes take place inside, you know.' He smiled, as if at some quiet joke. 'So you are going out there. Famous. Interesting, too.' He gave me a searching glance, and made another note. 'Ever any madness in your family?' he asked, in a matter-of-fact tone. I felt very annoyed. 'Is that question in the interests of science, too?' 'It would be,' he said, without taking notice of my irritation, 'interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot, but . . .' 'Are you an alienist?' I interrupted. 'Every doctor should be -- a little,' answered that original, imperturbably. 'I have a little theory which you messieurs who go out there must help me to prove. This is my share in the advantages my country shall reap from the possession of such a magnificent dependency. The mere wealth I leave to others. Pardon my questions, but you are the first Englishman coming under my observation . . .' I hastened to assure him I was not in the least typical. 'If I were,' said I, 'I wouldn't be talking like this with you.' 'What you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,' he said, with a laugh. 'Avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun. Adieu. How do you English say, eh? Good-bye. Ah! Good-bye. Adieu. In the tropics one must before everything keep calm.' . . . He lifted a warning forefinger. . . . 'DU CALME, DU CALME. ADIEU.'

""One thing more remained to do -- say good-bye to my excellent aunt. I found her triumphant. I had a cup of tea -- the last decent cup of tea for many days -- and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would expect a lady's drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the fireside. In the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me I had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted creature -- a piece of good fortune for the Company -- a man you don't get hold of every day. Good heavens! and I was going to take charge of a two-penny-half-penny river-steamboat with a penny whistle attached! It appeared, however, I was also one of the Workers, with a capital -- you know. Something like an emissary of light, something like a lower sort of apostle. There had been a lot of such rot let loose in print and talk just about that time, and the excellent woman, living right in the rush of all that humbug, got carried off her feet. She talked about 'weaning those ignorant millions from their horrid ways,' till, upon my word, she made me quite uncomfortable. I ventured to hint that the Company was run for profit

""'You forget, dear Charlie, that the labourer is worthy of his hire,' she said, brightly. It's queer how out of touch with truth women are. They live in a world of their own, and there has never been anything like it, and never can be. It is too beautiful altogether, and if they were to set it up it would go to pieces before the first sunset. Some confounded fact we men have been living contentedly with Ever since the day of creation would start up and knock the whole thing over

""After this I got embraced, told to wear flannel, be sure to write often, and so on -- and I left. In the street -- I don't know why -- a queer feeling came to me that I was an imposter. Odd thing that I, who used to clear out for any part of the world at twenty-four hours' notice, with less thought than most men give to the crossing of a street, had a moment -- I won't say of hesitation, but of startled pause, before this commonplace affair. The best way I can explain it to you is by saying that, for a second or two, I felt as though, instead of going to the centre of a continent, I were about to set off for the centre of the earth

""I left in a French steamer, and she called in every blamed port they have out there, for, as far as I could see, the sole purpose of landing soldiers and custom-house officers. I watched the coast. Watching a coast as it slips by the ship is like thinking about an enigma. There it is before you -- smiling, frowning, inviting, grand, mean, insipid, or savage, and always mute with an air of whispering, 'Come and find out.' This one was almost featureless, as if still in the making, with an aspect of monotonous grimness. The edge of a colossal jungle, so dark-green as to be almost black, fringed with white surf, ran straight, like a ruled line, far, far away along a blue sea whose glitter was blurred by a creeping mist. The sun was fierce, the land seemed to glisten and drip with steam. Here and there greyish-whitish specks showed up clustered inside the white surf, with a flag flying above them perhaps. Settlements some centuries old, and still no bigger than pinheads on the untouched expanse of their background. We pounded along, stopped, landed soldiers; went on, landed custom-house clerks to levy toll in what looked like a God-forsaken wilderness, with a tin shed and a flag-pole lost in it; landed more soldiers -- to take care of the custom-house clerks, presumably. Some, I heard, got drowned in the surf; but whether they did or not, nobody seemed particularly to care. They were just flung out there, and on we went. Every day the coast looked the same, as though we had not moved; but we passed various places -- trading places -- with names like Gran' Bassam Little Popo; names that seemed to belong to some sordid farce acted in front of a sinister back-cloth. The idleness of a passenger, my isolation amongst all these men with whom I had no point of contact, the oily and languid sea, the uniform sombreness of the coast, seemed to keep me away from the truth of things, within the toil of a mournful and senseless delusion. The voice of the surf heard now and then was a positive pleasure, like the speech of a brother. It was something natural, that had its reason, that had a meaning. Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality. It was paddled by black fellows. You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening. They shouted, sang; their bodies streamed with perspiration; they had faces like grotesque masks -- these chaps; but they had bone, muscle, a wild vitality, an intense energy of movement, that was as natural and true as the surf along their coast. They wanted no excuse for being there. They were a great comfort to look at. For a time I would feel I belonged still to a world of straightforward facts; but the feeling would not last long. Something would turn up to scare it away. Once, I remember, we came upon a man-of-war anchored off the coast. There wasn't even a shed there, and she was shelling the bush. It appears the French had one of their wars going on thereabouts. Her ensign dropped limp like a rag; the muzzles of the long six-inch guns stuck out all over the low hull; the greasy, slimy swell swung her up lazily and let her down, swaying her thin masts. In the empty immensity of earth, sky, and water, there she was, incomprehensible, firing into a continent. Pop, would go one of the six-inch guns; a small flame would dart and vanish, a little white smoke would disappear, a tiny projectile would give a feeble screech -- and nothing happened. Nothing could happen. There was a touch of insanity in the proceeding, a sense of lugubrious drollery in the sight; and it was not dissipated by somebody on board assuring me earnestly there was a camp of natives -- he called them enemies! -- hidden out of sight somewhere

""We gave her her letters (I heard the men in that lonely ship were dying of fever at the rate of three a day) and went on. We called at some more places with farcical names, where the merry dance of death and trade goes on in a still and earthy atmosphere as of an overheated catacomb; all along the formless coast bordered by dangerous surf, as if Nature herself had tried to ward off intruders; in and out of rivers, streams of death in life, whose banks were rotting into mud, whose waters, thickened into slime, invaded the contorted mangroves, that seemed to writhe at us in the extremity of an impotent despair. Nowhere did we stop long enough to get a particularized impression, but the general sense of vague and oppressive wonder grew upon me. It was like a weary pilgrimage amongst hints for nightmares.

""It was upward of thirty days before I saw the mouth of the big river. We anchored off the seat of the government. But my work would not begin till some two hundred miles farther on. So as soon as I could I made a start for a place thirty miles higher up

""I had my passage on a little sea-going steamer. Her captain was a Swede, and knowing me for a seaman, invited me on the bridge. He was a young man, lean, fair, and morose, with lanky hair and a shuffling gait. As we left the miserable little wharf, he tossed his head contemptuously at the shore. 'Been living there?' he asked. I said, 'Yes.' 'Fine lot these government chaps -- are they not?' he went on, speaking English with great precision and considerable bitterness. 'It is funny what some people will do for a few francs a month. I wonder what becomes of that kind when it goes upcountry?' I said to him I expected to see that soon. 'So-o-o!' he exclaimed. He shuffled athwart, keeping one eye ahead vigilantly. 'Don't be too sure,' he continued. 'The other day I took up a man who hanged himself on the road. He was a Swede, too.' 'Hanged himself! Why, in God's name?' I cried. He kept on looking out watchfully. 'Who knows? The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps.'

""At last we opened a reach. A rocky cliff appeared, mounds of turned-up earth by the shore, houses on a hill, others with iron roofs, amongst a waste of excavations, or hanging to the declivity. A continuous noise of the rapids above hovered over this scene of inhabited devastation. A lot of people, mostly black and naked, moved about like ants. A jetty projected into the river. A blinding sunlight drowned all this at times in a sudden recrudescence of glare. 'There's your Company's station,' said the Swede, pointing to three wooden barrack-like structures on the rocky slope. 'I will send your things up. Four boxes did you say? So. Farewell.'
""I came upon a boiler wallowing in the grass, then found a path leading up the hill. It turned aside for the boulders, and also for an undersized railway-truck lying there on its back with its wheels in the air. One was off. The thing looked as dead as the carcass of some animal. I came upon more pieces of decaying machinery, a stack of rusty rails. To the left a clump of trees made a shady spot, where dark things seemed to stir feebly. I blinked, the path was steep. A horn tooted to the right, and I saw the black people run. A heavy and dull detonation shook the ground, a puff of smoke came out of the cliff, and that was all. No change appeared on the face of the rock. They were building a railway. The cliff was not in the way or anything; but this objectless blasting was all the work going on.

""A slight clinking behind me made me turn my head. Six black men advanced in a file, toiling up the path. They walked erect and slow, balancing small baskets full of earth on their heads, and the clink kept time with their footsteps. Black rags were wound round their loins, and the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails. I could see every rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking. Another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war I had seen firing into a continent. It was the same kind of ominous voice; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. They were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea. All their meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils quivered, the eyes stared stonily uphill. They passed me within six inches, without a glance, with that complete, deathlike indifference of unhappy savages. Behind this raw matter one of the reclaimed, the product of the new forces at work, strolled despondently, carrying a rifle by its middle. He had a uniform jacket with one button off, and seeing a white man on the path, hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he could not tell who I might be. He was speedily reassured, and with a large, white, rascally grin, and a glance at his charge, seemed to take me into partnership in his exalted trust. After all, I also was a part of the great cause of these high and just proceedings.

""Instead of going up, I turned and descended to the left. My idea was to let that chain-gang get out of sight before I climbed the hill. You know I am not particularly tender; I've had to strike and to fend off. I've had to resist and to attack sometimes -- that's only one way of resisting -- without counting the exact cost, according to the demands of such sort of life as I had blundered into. I've seen the devil of violence, and the devil of greed, and the devil of hot desire; but, by all the stars! these were strong, lusty, red-eyed devils, that swayed and drove men -- men, I tell you. But as I stood on this hillside, I foresaw that in the blinding sunshine of that land I would become acquainted with a flabby, pretending, weak-eyed devil of a rapacious and pitiless folly. How insidious he could be, too, I was only to find out several months later and a thousand miles farther. For a moment I stood appalled, as though by a warning. Finally I descended the hill, obliquely, towards the trees I had seen

""I avoided a vast artificial hole somebody had been digging on the slope, the purpose of which I found it impossible to divine. It wasn't a quarry or a sandpit, anyhow. It was just a hole. It might have been connected with the philanthropic desire of giving the criminals something to do. I don't know. Then I nearly fell into a very narrow ravine, almost no more than a scar in the hillside. I discovered that a lot of imported drainage-pipes for the settlement had been tumbled in there. There wasn't one that was not broken. It was a wanton smash-up. At last I got under the trees. My purpose was to stroll into the shade for a moment; but no sooner within than it seemed to me I had stepped into the gloomy circle of some Inferno. The rapids were near, and an uninterrupted, uniform, headlong, rushing noise filled the mournful stillness Of the grove, where not a breath stirred, not a leaf moved, with a mysterious sound -- as though the tearing pace of the launched earth had suddenly become audible

""Black shapes crouched, lay, sat between the trees leaning against the trunks, clinging to the earth, half coming out, half effaced within the dim light, in all the attitudes of pain, abandonment, and despair. Another mine on the cliff went off, followed by a slight shudder of the soil under my feet. The work was going on. The work! And this was the place where some of the helpers had withdrawn to die

""They were dying slowly -- it was very clear. They were not enemies, they were not criminals, they were nothing earthly now -- nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation, lying confusedly in the greenish gloom. Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts, lost in uncongenial surroundings, fed on unfamiliar food, they sickened, became inefficient, and were then allowed to crawl away and rest. These moribund shapes were free as air -- and nearly as thin. I began to distinguish the gleam of the eyes under the trees. Then, glancing down, I saw a face near my hand. The black bones reclined at full length with one shoulder against the tree, and slowly the eyelids rose and the sunken eyes looked up at me, enormous and vacant, a kind of blind, white flicker in the depths of the orbs, which died out slowly. The man seemed young -- almost a boy -- but you know with them it's hard to tell. I found nothing else to do but to offer him one of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket. The fingers closed slowly on it and held -- there was no other movement and no other glance. He had tied a bit of white worsted round his neck -- Why? Where did he get it? Was it a badge -- an ornament -- a charm -- a propitiatory act? Was there any idea at all connected with it? It looked startling round his black neck, this bit of white thread from beyond the seas

""Near the same tree two more bundles of acute angles sat with their legs drawn up. One, with his chin propped on his knees, stared at nothing, in an intolerable and appalling manner: his brother phantom rested its forehead, as if overcome with a great weariness; and all about others were scattered in every pose of contorted collapse as in some picture of a massacre or a pestilence. While I stood horror-struck, one of these creatures rose to his hands and knees, and went off on all-fours towards the river to drink. He lapped out of his hand, then sat up in the sunlight, crossing his shins in front of him, and after a time let his woolly head fall on his breastbone
""I didn't want any more loitering in the shade, and I made haste towards the station. When near the buildings I met a white man, in such an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for a sort of vision. I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket, snowy trousers, a clean necktie, and varnished boots. No hat. Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a big white hand. He was amazing, and had a penholder behind his ear

""I shook hands with this miracle, and I learned he was the Company's chief accountant, and that all the book-keeping was done at this station. He had come out for a moment, he said, 'to get a breath of fresh air.' The expression sounded wonderfully odd, with its suggestion of sedentary desk-life. I wouldn't have mentioned the fellow to you at all, only it was from his lips that I first heard the name of the man who is so indissolubly connected with the memories of that time. Moreover, I respected the fellow. Yes; I respected his collars, his vast cuffs, his brushed hair. His appearance was certainly that of a hairdresser's dummy; but in the great demoralization of the land he kept up his appearance. That's backbone. His starched collars and got-up shirt-fronts were achievements of character. He had been out nearly three years; and, later, I could not help asking him how he managed to sport such linen. He had just the faintest blush, and said modestly, 'I've been teaching one of the native women about the station. It was difficult. She had a distaste for the work.' Thus this man had verily accomplished something. And he was devoted to his books, which were in apple-pie order

""Everything else in the station was in a muddle -- heads, things, buildings. Strings of dusty niggers with splay feet arrived and departed; a stream of manufactured goods, rubbishy cottons, beads, and brass-wire set into the depths of darkness, and in return came a precious trickle of ivory.

""I had to wait in the station for ten days -- an eternity. I lived in a hut in the yard, but to be out of the chaos I would sometimes get into the accountant's office. It was built of horizontal planks, and so badly put together that, as he bent over his high desk, he was barred from neck to heels with narrow strips of sunlight. There was no need to open the big shutter to see. It was hot there, too; big flies buzzed fiendishly, and did not sting, but stabbed. I sat generally on the floor, while, of faultless appearance (and even slightly scented), perching on a high stool, he wrote, he wrote. Sometimes he stood up for exercise. When a truckle-bed with a sick man (some invalid agent from upcountry) was put in there, he exhibited a gentle annoyance. 'The groans of this sick person,' he said, 'distract my attention. And without that it is extremely difficult to guard against clerical errors in this climate.'

""One day he remarked, without lifting his head, 'In the interior you will no doubt meet Mr. Kurtz.' On my asking who Mr. Kurtz was, he said he was a first-class agent; and seeing my disappointment at this information, he added slowly, laying down his pen, 'He is a very remarkable person.' Further questions elicited from him that Mr. Kurtz was at present in charge of a trading-post, a very important one, in the true ivory-country, at 'the very bottom of there. Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together . . .' He began to write again. The sick man was too ill to groan. The flies buzzed in a great peace

""Suddenly there was a growing murmur of voices and a great tramping of feet. A caravan had come in. A violent babble of uncouth sounds burst out on the other side of the planks. All the carriers were speaking together, and in the midst of the uproar the lamentable voice of the chief agent was heard 'giving it up' tearfully for the twentieth time that day. . . . He rose slowly. 'What a frightful row,' he said. He crossed the room gently to look at the sick man, and returning, said to me, 'He does not hear.' 'What! Dead?' I asked, startled. 'No, not yet,' he answered, with great composure. Then, alluding with a toss of the head to the tumult in the station-yard, 'When one has got to make correct entries, one comes to hate those savages-- hate them to the death.' He remained thoughtful for a moment. 'When you see Mr. Kurtz' he went on, 'tell him from me that everything here' -- he glanced at the deck -- 'is very satisfactory. I don't like to write to him -- with those messengers of ours you never know who may get hold of your letter -- at that Central Station.' He stared at me for a moment with his mild, bulging eyes. 'Oh, he will go far, very far,' he began again. 'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above -- the Council in Europe, you know -- mean him to be.'

""He turned to his work. The noise outside had ceased, and presently in going out I stopped at the door. In the steady buzz of flies the homeward-bound agent was lying finished and insensible; the other, bent over his books, was making correct entries of perfectly correct transactions; and fifty feet below the doorstep I could see the still tree-tops of the grove of death.

""Next day I left that station at last, with a caravan of sixty men, for a two-hundred-mile tramp.

""No use telling you much about that. Paths, paths, everywhere; a stamped-in network of paths spreading over the empty land, through the long grass, through burnt grass, through thickets, down and up chilly ravines, up and down stony hills ablaze with heat; and a solitude, a solitude, nobody, not a hut. The population had cleared out a long time ago. Well, if a lot of mysterious niggers armed with all kinds of fearful weapons suddenly took to travelling on the road between Deal and Gravesend, catching the yokels right and left to carry heavy loads for them, I fancy every farm and cottage thereabouts would get empty very soon. Only here the dwellings were gone, too. Still I passed through several abandoned villages. There's something pathetically childish in the ruins of grass walls. Day after day, with the stamp and shuffle of sixty pair of bare feet behind me, each pair under a 60-lb. load. Camp, cook, sleep, strike camp, march. Now and then a carrier dead in harness, at rest in the long grass near the path, with an empty water-gourd and his long staff lying by his side. A great silence around and above. Perhaps on some quiet night the tremor of far-off drums, sinking, swelling, a tremor vast, faint; a sound weird, appealing, suggestive, and wild -- and perhaps with as profound a meaning as the sound of bells in a Christian country. Once a white man in an unbuttoned uniform, camping on the path with an armed escort of lank Zanzibaris, very hospitable and festive -- not to say drunk. Was looking after the upkeep of the road, he declared. Can't say I saw any road or any upkeep, unless the body of a middle-aged negro, with a bullet-hole in the forehead, upon which I absolutely stumbled three miles farther on, may be considered as a permanent improvement. I had a white companion, too, not a bad chap, but rather too fleshy and with the exasperating habit of fainting on the hot hillsides, miles away from the least bit of shade and water. Annoying, you know, to hold your own coat like a parasol over a man's head while he is coming to. I couldn't help asking him once what he meant by coming there at all. 'To make money, of course. What do you think?' he said, scornfully. Then he got fever, and had to be carried in a hammock slung under a pole. As he weighed sixteen stone I had no end of rows with the carriers. They jibbed, ran away, sneaked off with their loads in the night -- quite a mutiny. So, one evening, I made a speech in English with gestures, not one of which was lost to the sixty pairs of eyes before me, and the next morning I started the hammock off in front all right. An hour afterwards I came upon the whole concern wrecked in a bush -- man, hammock, groans, blankets, horrors. The heavy pole had skinned his poor nose. He was very anxious for me to kill somebody, but there wasn't the shadow of a carrier near. I remembered the old doctor -- 'It would be interesting for science to watch the mental changes of individuals, on the spot.' I felt I was becoming scientifically interesting. However, all that is to no purpose. On the fifteenth day I came in sight of the big river again, and hobbled into the Central Station. It was on a back water surrounded by scrub and forest, with a pretty border of smelly mud on one side, and on the three others enclosed by a crazy fence of rushes. A neglected gap was all the gate it had, and the first glance at the place was enough to let you see the flabby devil was running that show. White men with long staves in their hands appeared languidly from amongst the buildings, strolling up to take a look at me, and then retired out of sight somewhere. One of them, a stout, excitable chap with black moustaches, informed me with great volubility and many digressions, as soon as I told him who I was, that my steamer was at the bottom of the river. I was thunderstruck. What, how, why? Oh, it was 'all right.' The 'manager himself' was there. All quite correct. 'Everybody had behaved splendidly! splendidly!' -- 'you must,' he said in agitation, 'go and see the general manager at once. He is waiting!'

""I did not see the real significance of that wreck at once. I fancy I see it now, but I am not sure -- not at all. Certainly the affair was too stupid -- when I think of it -- to be altogether natural. Still . . . But at the moment it presented itself simply as a confounded nuisance. The steamer was sunk. They had started two days before in a sudden hurry up the river with the manager on board, in charge of some volunteer skipper, and before they had been out three hours they tore the bottom out of her on stones, and she sank near the south bank. I asked myself what I was to do there, now my boat was lost. As a matter of fact, I had plenty to do in fishing my command out of the river. I had to set about it the very next day. That, and the repairs when I brought the pieces to the station, took some months.

""My first interview with the manager was curious. He did not ask me to sit down after my twenty-mile walk that morning. He was commonplace in complexion, in features, in manners, and in voice. He was of middle size and of ordinary build. His eyes, of the usual blue, were perhaps remarkably cold, and he certainly could make his glance fall on one as trenchant and heavy as an axe. But even at these times the rest of his person seemed to disclaim the intention. Otherwise there was only an indefinable, faint expression of his lips, something stealthy -- a smile -- not a smile -- I remember it, but I can't explain. It was unconscious, this smile was, though just after he had said something it got intensified for an instant. It came at the end of his speeches like a seal applied on the words to make the meaning of the commonest phrase appear absolutely inscrutable. He was a common trader, from his youth up employed in these parts -- nothing more. He was obeyed, yet he inspired neither love nor fear, nor even respect. He inspired uneasiness. That Was it! Uneasiness. Not a definite mistrust -- just uneasiness -- nothing more. You have no idea how effective such a . . . a. . . . faculty can be. He had no genius for organizing, for initiative, or for order even. That was evident in such things as the deplorable state of the station. He had no learning, and no intelligence. His position had come to him -- why? Perhaps because he was never ill . . . He had served three terms of three years out there . . . Because triumphant health in the general rout of constitutions is a kind of power in itself. When he went home on leave he rioted on a large scale -- pompously. Jack ashore -- with a difference -- in externals only. This one could gather from his casual talk. He originated nothing, he could keep the routine going -- that's all. But he was great. He was great by this little thing that it was impossible to tell what could control such a man. He never gave that secret away. Perhaps there was nothing within him. Such a suspicion made one pause -- for out there there were no external checks. Once when various tropical diseases had laid low almost every 'agent' in the station, he was heard to say, 'Men who come out here should have no entrails.' He sealed the utterance with that smile of his, as though it had been a door opening into a darkness he had in his keeping. You fancied you had seen things -- but the seal was on. When annoyed at meal-times by the constant quarrels of the white men about precedence, he ordered an immense round table to be made, for which a special house had to be built. This was the station's mess-room. Where he sat was the first place -- the rest were nowhere. One felt this to be his unalterable conviction. He was neither civil nor uncivil. He was quiet. He allowed his 'boy' -- an overfed young negro from the coast -- to treat the white men, under his very eyes, with provoking insolence.

""He began to speak as soon as he saw me. I had been very long on the road. He could not wait. Had to start without me. The up-river stations had to be relieved. There had been so many delays already that he did not know who was dead and who was alive, and how they got on -- and so on, and so on. He paid no attention to my explanations, and, playing with a stick of sealing-wax, repeated several times that the situation was 'very grave, very grave.' There were rumours that a very important station was in jeopardy, and its chief, Mr. Kurtz, was ill. Hoped it was not true. Mr. Kurtz was . . . I felt weary and irritable. Hang Kurtz, I thought. I interrupted him by saying I had heard of Mr. Kurtz on the coast. 'Ah! So they talk of him down there,' he murmured to himself. Then he began again, assuring me Mr. Kurtz was the best agent he had, an exceptional man, of the greatest importance to the Company; therefore I could understand his anxiety. He was, he said, 'very, very uneasy.' Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal, exclaimed, 'Ah, Mr. Kurtz!' broke the stick of sealing-wax and seemed dumbfounded by the accident. Next thing he wanted to know 'how long it would take to' . . . I interrupted him again. Being hungry, you know, and kept on my feet too. I was getting savage. 'How can I tell?' I said. 'I haven't even seen the wreck yet -- some months, no doubt.' All this talk seemed to me so futile. 'Some months,' he said. 'Well, let us say three months before we can make a start. Yes. That ought to do the affair.' I flung out of his hut (he lived all alone in a clay hut with a sort of verandah) muttering to myself my opinion of him. He was a chattering idiot. Afterwards I took it back when it was borne in upon me startlingly with what extreme nicety he had estimated the time requisite for the 'affair.'

""I went to work the next day, turning, so to speak, my back on that station. In that way only it seemed to me I could keep my hold on the redeeming facts of life. Still, one must look about sometimes; and then I saw this station, these men strolling aimlessly about in the sunshine of the yard. I asked myself sometimes what it all meant. They wandered here and there with their absurd long staves in their hands, like a lot of faithless pilgrims bewitched inside a rotten fence. The word 'ivory' rang in the air, was whispered, was sighed. You would think they were praying to it. A taint of imbecile rapacity blew through it all, like a whiff from some corpse. By Jove! I've never seen anything so unreal in my life. And outside, the silent wilderness surrounding this cleared speck on the earth struck me as something great and invincible, like evil or truth, waiting patiently for the passing away of this fantastic invasion

""Oh, these months! Well, never mind. Various things happened. One evening a grass shed full of calico, cotton prints, beads, and I don't know what else, burst into a blaze so suddenly that you would have thought the earth had opened to let an avenging fire consume all that trash. I was smoking my pipe quietly by my dismantled steamer, and saw them all cutting capers in the light, with their arms lifted high, when the stout man with moustaches came tearing down to the river, a tin pail in his hand, assured me that everybody was 'behaving splendidly, splendidly,' dipped about a quart of water and tore back again. I noticed there was a hole in the bottom of his pail.

""I strolled up. There was no hurry. You see the thing had gone off like a box of matches. It had been hopeless from the very first. The flame had leaped high, driven everybody back, lighted up everything -- and collapsed. The shed was already a heap of embers glowing fiercely. A nigger was being beaten near by. They said he had caused the fire in some way; be that as it may, he was screeching most horribly. I saw him, later, for several days, sitting in a bit of shade looking very sick and trying to recover himself; afterwards he arose and went out -- and the wilderness without a sound took him into its bosom again. As I approached the glow from the dark I found myself at the back of two men, talking. I heard the name of Kurtz pronounced, then the words, 'take advantage of this unfortunate accident.' One of the men was the manager. I wished him a good evening. 'Did you ever see anything like it -- eh? it is incredible,' he said, and walked off. The other man remained. He was a first-class agent, young, gentlemanly, a bit reserved, with a forked little beard and a hooked nose. He was stand-offish with the other agents, and they on their side said he was the manager's spy upon them. As to me, I had hardly ever spoken to him before. We got into talk, and by and by we strolled away from the hissing ruins. Then he asked me to his room, which was in the main building of the station. He struck a match, and I perceived that this young aristocrat had not only a silver-mounted dressing-case but also a whole candle all to himself. Just at that time the manager was the only man supposed to have any right to candles. Native mats covered the clay walls; a collection of spears, assegais, shields, knives was hung up in trophies. The business entrusted to this fellow was the making of bricks -- so I had been informed; but there wasn't a fragment of a brick anywhere in the station, and he had been there more than a year -- waiting. It seems he could not make bricks without something, I don't know what -- straw maybe. Anyway, it could not be found there and as it was not likely to be sent from Europe, it did not appear clear to me what he was waiting for. An act of special creation perhaps. However, they were all waiting -- all the sixteen or twenty pilgrims of them -- for something; and upon my word it did not seem an un-congenial occupation, from the way they took it, though the only thing that ever came to them was disease -- as far as I could see. They beguiled the time by back-biting and intriguing against each other in a foolish kind of way. There was an air of plotting about that station, but nothing came of it, of course. It was as unreal as everything else -- as the philanthropic pretence of the whole concern, as their talk, as their government, as their show of work. The only real feeling was a desire to get appointed to a trading-post where ivory was to be had, so that they could earn percentages. They intrigued and slandered and hated each other only on that account -- but as to effectually lifting a little finger -- oh, no. By heavens! there is something after all in the world allowing one man to steal a horse while another must not look at a halter. Steal a horse straight out. Very well. He has done it. Perhaps he can ride. But there is a way of looking at a halter that would provoke the most charitable of saints into a kick.

""I had no idea why he wanted to be sociable, but as we chatted in there it suddenly occurred to me the fellow was trying to get at something -- in fact, pumping me. He alluded constantly to Europe, to the people I was supposed to know there -- putting leading questions as to my acquaintances in the sepulchral city, and so on. His little eyes glittered like mica discs -- with curiosity -- though he tried to keep up a bit of superciliousness. At first I was astonished, but very soon I became awfully curious to see what he would find out from me. I couldn't possibly imagine what I had in me to make it worth his while. It was very pretty to see how he baffled himself, for in truth my body was full only of chills, and my head had nothing in it but that wretched steamboat business. It was evident he took me for a perfectly shameless prevaricator. At last he got angry, and, to conceal a movement of furious annoyance, he yawned. I rose. Then I noticed a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman, draped and blindfolded, carrying a lighted torch. The background was sombre -- almost black. The movement of the woman was stately, and the effect of the torchlight on the face was sinister

""It arrested me, and he stood by civilly, holding an empty half-pint champagne bottle (medical comforts) with the candle stuck in it. To my question he said Mr. Kurtz had painted this -- in this very station more than a year ago -- while waiting for means to go to his trading post. 'Tell me, pray,' said I, 'who is this Mr. Kurtz?'

""'The chief of the Inner Station,' he answered in a short tone, looking away. 'Much obliged,' I said, laughing. 'And you are the brickmaker of the Central Station. Every one knows that.' He was silent for a while. 'He is a prodigy,' he said at last. 'He is an emissary of pity and science and progress, and devil knows what else. We want,' he began to declaim suddenly, 'for the guidance of the cause entrusted to us by Europe, so to speak, higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose.' 'Who says that?' I asked. 'Lots of them,' he replied. 'Some even write that; and so HE comes here, a special being, as you ought to know.' 'Why ought I to know?' I interrupted, really surprised. He paid no attention. 'Yes. To-day he is chief of the best station, next year he will be assistant-manager, two years more and . . . but I dare-say you know what he will be in two years' time. You are of the new gang -- the gang of virtue. The same people who sent him specially also recommended you. Oh, don't say no. I've my own eyes to trust.' Light dawned upon me. My dear aunt's influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected effect upon that young man. I nearly burst into a laugh. 'Do you read the Company's confidential correspondence?' I asked. He hadn't a word to say. It was great fun. 'When Mr. Kurtz,' I continued, severely, 'is General Manager, you won't have the opportunity.'

""He blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. The moon had risen. Black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on the glow, whence proceeded a sound of hissing; steam ascended in the moonlight, the beaten nigger groaned somewhere. 'What a row the brute makes!' said the indefatigable man with the moustaches, appearing near us. 'Serve him right. Transgression -- punishment -- bang! Pitiless, pitiless. That's the only way. This will prevent all conflagrations for the future. I was just telling the manager . . .' He noticed my companion, and became crestfallen all at once. 'Not in bed yet,' he said, with a kind of servile heartiness; 'it's so natural. Ha! Danger -- agitation.' He vanished. I went on to the river-side, and the other followed me. I heard a scathing murmur at my ear, 'Heap of muffs -- go to.' The pilgrims could be seen in knots gesticulating, discussing. Several had still their staves in their hands. I verily believe they took these sticks to bed with them. Beyond the fence the forest stood up spectrally in the moonlight, and through that dim stir, through the faint sounds of that lamentable courtyard, the silence of the land went home to one's very heart -- its mystery, its greatness, the amazing reality of its concealed life. The hurt nigger moaned feebly somewhere near by, and then fetched a deep sigh that made me mend my pace away from there. I felt a hand introducing itself under my arm. 'My dear sir,' said the fellow, 'I don't want to be misunderstood, and especially by you, who will see Mr. Kurtz long before I can have that pleasure. I wouldn't like him to get a false idea of my disposition. . . .'

""I let him run on, this papier-mache Mephistopheles, and it seemed to me that if I tried I could poke my fore-finger through him, and would find nothing inside but a little loose dirt, maybe. He, don't you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man, and I could see that the coming of that Kurtz had upset them both not a little. He talked precipitately, and I did not try to stop him. I had my shoulders against the wreck of my steamer, hauled up on the slope like a carcass of some big river animal. The smell of mud, of primeval mud, by Jove! was in my nostrils, the high stillness of primeval forest was before my eyes; there were shiny patches on the black creek. The moon had spread over everything a thin layer of silver -- over the rank grass, over the mud, upon the wall of matted vegetation standing higher than the wall of a temple, over the great river I could see through a sombre gap glittering, glittering, as it flowed broadly by without a murmur. All this was great, expectant, mute, while the man jabbered about himself. I wondered whether the stillness on the face of the immensity looking at us two were meant as an appeal or as a menace. What were we who had strayed in here? Could we handle that dumb thing, or would it handle us? I felt how big, how confoundedly big, was that thing that couldn't talk, and perhaps was deaf as well. What was in there? I could see a little ivory coming out from there, and I had heard Mr. Kurtz was in there. I had heard enough about it, too -- God knows! Yet somehow it didn't bring any image with it -- no more than if I had been told an angel or a fiend was in there. I believed it in the same way one of you might believe there are inhabitants in the planet Mars. I knew once a Scotch sailmaker who was certain, dead sure, there were people in Mars. If you asked him for some idea how they looked and behaved, he would get shy and mutter something about 'walking on all-fours.' If you as much as smiled, he would -- though a man of sixty -- offer to fight you. I would not have gone so far as to fight for Kurtz, but I went for him near enough to a lie. You know I hate, detest, and can't bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavour of mortality in lies -- which is exactly what I hate and detest in the world -- what I want to forget. It makes me miserable and sick, like biting something rotten would do. Temperament, I suppose. Well, I went near enough to it by letting the young fool there believe anything he liked to imagine as to my influence in Europe. I became in an instant as much of a pretence as the rest of the bewitched pilgrims. This simply because I had a notion it somehow would be of help to that Kurtz whom at the time I did not see -- you understand. He was just a word for me. I did not see the man in the name any more than you do. Do you see him? Do you see the story? Do you see anything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream -- making a vain attempt, because no relation of a dream can convey the dream-sensation, that commingling of absurdity, surprise, and bewilderment in a tremor of struggling revolt, that notion of being captured by the incredible which is of the very essence of dreams. . . .""

He was silent for a while

"". . . No, it is impossible; it is impossible to convey the life-sensation of any given epoch of one's existence -- that which makes its truth, its meaning -- its subtle and penetrating essence. It is impossible. We live, as we dream -- alone. . . .""

He paused again as if reflecting, then added: ""Of course in this you fellows see more than I could then. You see me, whom you know. . . .""

It had become so pitch dark that we listeners could hardly see one another. For a long time already he, sitting apart, had been no more to us than a voice. There was not a word from anybody. The others might have been asleep, but I was awake. I listened, I listened on the watch for the sentence, for the word, that would give me the clue to the faint uneasiness inspired by this narrative that seemed to shape itself without human lips in the heavy night-air of the river.

"". . . Yes -- I let him run on,"" Marlow began again, ""and think what he pleased about the powers that were behind me. I did! And there was nothing behind me! There was nothing but that wretched, old, mangled steamboat I was leaning against, while he talked fluently about 'the necessity for every man to get on.' 'And when one comes out here, you conceive, it is not to gaze at the moon.' Mr. Kurtz was a 'universal genius,' but even a genius would find it easier to work with 'adequate tools -- intelligent men.' He did not make bricks -- why, there was a physical impossibility in the way -- as I was well aware; and if he did secretarial work for the manager, it was because 'no sensible man rejects wantonly the confidence of his superiors.' Did I see it? I saw it. What more did I want? What I really wanted was rivets, by heaven! Rivets. To get on with the work -- to stop the hole. Rivets I wanted. There were cases of them down at the coast -- cases -- piled up -- burst -- split! You kicked a loose rivet at every second step in that station-yard on the hillside. Rivets had rolled into the grove of death. You could fill your pockets with rivets for the trouble of stooping down -- and there wasn't one rivet to be found where it was wanted. We had plates that would do, but nothing to fasten them with. And every week the messenger, a long negro, letter-bag on shoulder and staff in hand, left our station for the coast. And several times a week a coast caravan came in with trade goods -- ghastly glazed calico that made you shudder only to look at it, glass beads value about a penny a quart, confounded spotted cotton handkerchiefs. And no rivets. Three carriers could have brought all that was wanted to set that steamboat afloat.

""He was becoming confidential now, but I fancy my unresponsive attitude must have exasperated him at last, for he judged it necessary to inform me he feared neither God nor devil, let alone any mere man. I said I could see that very well, but what I wanted was a certain quantity of rivets -- and rivets were what really Mr. Kurtz wanted, if he had only known it. Now letters went to the coast every week. . . . 'My dear sir,' he cried, 'I write from dictation.' I demanded rivets. There was a way -- for an intelligent man. He changed his manner; became very cold, and suddenly began to talk about a hippopotamus; wondered whether sleeping on board the steamer (I stuck to my salvage night and day) I wasn't disturbed. There was an old hippo that had the bad habit of getting out on the bank and roaming at night over the station grounds. The pilgrims used to turn out in a body and empty every rifle they could lay hands on at him. Some even had sat up o' nights for him. All this energy was wasted, though. 'That animal has a charmed life,' he said; 'but you can say this only of brutes in this country. No man -- you apprehend me? -- no man here bears a charmed life.' He stood there for a moment in the moonlight with his delicate hooked nose set a little askew, and his mica eyes glittering without a wink, then, with a curt Good-night, he strode off. I could see he was disturbed and considerably puzzled, which made me feel more hopeful than I had been for days. It was a great comfort to turn from that chap to my influential friend, the battered, twisted, ruined, tin-pot steamboat. I clambered on board. She rang under my feet like an empty Huntley & Palmer biscuit-tin kicked along a gutter; she was nothing so solid in make, and rather less pretty in shape, but I had expended enough hard work on her to make me love her. No influential friend would have served me better. She had given me a chance to come out a bit -- to find out what I could do. No, I don't like work. I had rather laze about and think of all the fine things that can be done. I don't like work -- no man does -- but I like what is in the work -- the chance to find yourself. Your own reality -- for yourself, not for others -- what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.

""I was not surprised to see somebody sitting aft, on the deck, with his legs dangling over the mud. You see I rather chummed with the few mechanics there were in that station, whom the other pilgrims naturally despised -- on account of their imperfect manners, I suppose. This was the foreman -- a boiler-maker by trade -- a good worker. He was a lank, bony, yellow-faced man, with big intense eyes. His aspect was worried, and his head was as bald as the palm of my hand; but his hair in falling seemed to have stuck to his chin, and had prospered in the new locality, for his beard hung down to his waist. He was a widower with six young children (he had left them in charge of a sister of his to come out there), and the passion of his life was pigeon-flying. He was an enthusiast and a connoisseur. He would rave about pigeons. After work hours he used sometimes to come over from his hut for a talk about his children and his pigeons; at work, when he had to crawl in the mud under the bottom of the steamboat, he would tie up that beard of his in a kind of white serviette he brought for the purpose. It had loops to go over his ears. In the evening he could be seen squatted on the bank rinsing that wrapper in the creek with great care, then spreading it solemnly on a bush to dry.

""I slapped him on the back and shouted, 'We shall have rivets!' He scrambled to his feet exclaiming, 'No! Rivets!' as though he couldn't believe his ears. Then in a low voice, 'You . . . eh?' I don't know why we behaved like lunatics. I put my finger to the side of my nose and nodded mysteriously. 'Good for you!' he cried, snapped his fingers above his head, lifting one foot. I tried a jig. We capered on the iron deck. A frightful clatter came out of that hulk, and the virgin forest on the other bank of the creek sent it back in a thundering roll upon the sleeping station. It must have made some of the pilgrims sit up in their hovels. A dark figure obscured the lighted doorway of the manager's hut, vanished, then, a second or so after, the doorway itself vanished, too. We stopped, and the silence driven away by the stamping of our feet flowed back again from the recesses of the land. The great wall of vegetation, an exuberant and entangled mass of trunks, branches, leaves, boughs, festoons, motionless in the moonlight, was like a rioting invasion of soundless life, a rolling wave of plants, piled up, crested, ready to topple over the creek, to sweep every little man of us out of his little existence. And it moved not. A deadened burst of mighty splashes and snorts reached us from afar, as though an ichthyosaurus had been taking a bath of glitter in the great river. 'After all,' said the boiler-maker in a reasonable tone, 'why shouldn't we get the rivets?' Why not, indeed! I did not know of any reason why we shouldn't. 'They'll come in three weeks,' I said confidently.

""But they didn't. Instead of rivets there came an invasion, an infliction, a visitation. It came in sections during the next three weeks, each section headed by a donkey carrying a white man in new clothes and tan shoes, bowing from that elevation right and left to the impressed pilgrims. A quarrelsome band of footsore sulky niggers trod on the heels of the donkey; a lot of tents, camp-stools, tin boxes, white cases, brown bales would be shot down in the court-yard, and the air of mystery would deepen a little over the muddle of the station. Five such instalments came, with their absurd air of disorderly flight with the loot of innumerable outfit shops and provision stores, that, one would think, they were lugging, after a raid, into the wilderness for equitable division. It was an inextricable mess of things decent in themselves but that human folly made look like the spoils of thieving.

""This devoted band called itself the Eldorado Exploring Expedition, and I believe they were sworn to secrecy. Their talk, however, was the talk of sordid buccaneers: it was reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity, and cruel without courage; there was not an atom of fore-sight or of serious intention in the whole batch of them, and they did not seem aware these things are wanted for the work of the world. To tear treasure out of the bowels of the land was their desire, with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe. Who paid the expenses of the noble enterprise I don't know; but the uncle of our manager was leader of that lot.

""In exterior he resembled a butcher in a poor neighbourhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his fat paunch with ostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab.

""I had given up worrying myself about the rivets. One's capacity for that kind of folly is more limited than you would suppose. I said Hang! -- and let things slide. I had plenty of time for meditation, and now and then I would give some thought to Kurtz. I wasn't very interested in him. No. Still, I was curious to see whether this man, who had come out equipped with moral ideas of some sort, would climb to the top after all and how he would set about his work when there.""",Joseph Conrad,1963,"[64, 58, 61, 65, 76, 86]",6

Strange as it seems, I met in my dreams, Nick Teen and Al K. Hall
Here's what they said to me, 'Use your head, just see your life is very, very dull""

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all

Well, here is the joke, when I awoke, it wasn't finished yet
I noticed first a terrible thirst
And then a craving for a cigarette

Well, I never gargled, I never gambled, I never smoked at all

267,Desert Pete,"I was travelin' West of Buckskin on my way to a cattle run, 'cross a little cactus desert under a hard bargaining sun. Thirsty down to my toenails, I stopped to rest me on a stump, but I tell you I just couldn't believe it when I saw that water pump. I took it to be a mirage at first. It'll fool a thirsty man. Then I saw a note stuck in a bakin' powder can. ""This pump is old,"" the note began, ""but she works. So give'er a try. I put a new sucker washer in 'er. You may find the leather dry

You've got to prime the pump. You must have faith and believe. You've got to give of yourself 'fore you're worthy to receive
Drink all the water you can hold. Wash your face to your feet. Leave the bottle full for others. Thank you kindly, Desert Pete

Yeah, you'll have to prime the pump, work that handle like there's a fire. Under the rock you'll find some water left there in a bitter's jar. Now there's just enough to prime it with, so don't you go drinkin' first. Just pour it in and pump like mad and, buddy, you'll quench your thirst

You've got to prime the pump. You must have faith and believe. You've got to give of yourself 'fore you're worthy to receive

Well, I found the jar, and I tell you, nothin' was ever prettier to my eye and I was tempted strong to drink it because that pump looked mighty dry, but the note went on, ""Have faith, my friend, there's water down below. You've got to give to really get. I'm the one who ought to know.""

So I poured in the jar and started pumpin' and I heard a beautiful sound of water bubblin' 'n' splashin' up out of that hole in the ground. Then I took off my shoes and drunk my fill of that cold refreshin' treat. Tthen I thanked the Lord, and I thanked the pump, and I thanked old Desert Pete

Now I know that my bridges are burning
'Cause there'll never be no one else for me
So I pray, darling, soon you'll be returning
And you'll break these chains of love and set me free

And I know I'm picked a winner, 'cause I've got lucky lips!
And I know I'm bound to win, yeah, 'cos I've got lucky lips!

Ike you better let your heart be your guide
But I don't wanna, I don't wanna lose either one, no
Which makes it so hard to decide

Home from work down thirty-one
Past Franklin High

The son she never knew
It hurt so much to give him up
But what else could she do?

She never heard the couple's name
Just that they were nice

Does he drive a car by now?
Has he been in love?

She shakes back to reality
She knows things turn out the way they should be
But she just can't help but ask herself
Does he know about me?

[Chorus:]
He would be sixteen
The son she never knew
It hurt so much to give him up
But what else could she do?
He would be sixteen

She never even got to hold him
And nights like this it hurts to miss
The son she's never seen
He would be sixteen
He would be sixteen",Michelle Wright,1963,"[56, 51, 45, 48, 52, 65, 74, 85, 96]",9
287,Everybody Monkey,"[Verse 1]
Took a trip to Mexico
Met a girl in a bar and I took her home
I thought it was love at last
Until she robbed me of all my cash
And my credit cards
My ID, the whole nine yards
I had to borrow from grandma
(And my grandpa)
About ten years ago
I got a Blockbuster video
I took it home with me
Popped in Back To The Future 3
It slipped right through the cracks
Of my couch I didn't bring it back
'Cause now I owe three thousand bucks
And man that sucks 'cause

[Chorus]
I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money
All around the world

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Went to Sea World by myself
I was depressed and drunk as hell
Went to the Shamu show
Popped out my flask and drank some more
So blacked out and out of it
Thought Shamu was talking shit
So then I broke his fucking tank
And that hurt my bank then
Took a plane to Hawaii
To vacation and to buy
A house right on the hill
Salesman said that I got a deal
Little did I know
The house was on a volcano
Then that volcano straight erupted
I'm bankrupted

[Chorus]
I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money
All around the world, yeah

[Bridge]
All these debts and bad investments
Haven't taught me any lessons
Learn from me and pay attention

[Post-Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I owe every-

I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money
I owe everybody money

288,Pay Back,"[Started from the Bottom (SFTB)]

[Part 1]
Started from the bottom
Da, wo ich herkomm', gibt es keine Badepromenaden, sondern Stahlbetonfassaden
Lass' AK-Geschosse hageln, zwanzig Jahre Loch im Magen
Gleicher Traum, ich bin allein mit meiner Ma gekomm'n im Wagen
Pain wird weggeblasen, wenn wir Planktonhazeknolle atmen
Und die kriminelle Bahn gelegt durch Krabbenkokanasen
Cash auf Schwarzgeldkonten stapeln
Mein Stiefvater war Koksticker, macht Bares aus den Bubbles, Kilos Ware auf dem Wagen
Dafür Jahre auf ihn warten, sie hatten Schaden davon getragen
Ich war sechs, die Seele schwarz und voller Narben
Deshalb damals schon cold-blooded
Jede Nacht betete meine Mama: „Gott bewahre“, wenn ich Magnumtrommeln lade
Heut 75k CDs ohne ein'n Radiosong vermarkten
Dicker, niemand dachte, dass wir in 'ner starken Woche charten
Mit Capri_sonne starten, um den Status Gold zu jagen
Ob ich's schaffe, wird sich eines Tages offenbaren

[Hook 1: SpongeBOZZ & Sample / beides]

Kalaschnikows geladen, lasse Stahlgeschosse hageln

[Part 2]
JBB 2013, Qualifikation
Schwamm am Mikrofon – Diskussion spaltet die Nation
Über Nacht 'ne Million'n, ratter' im Takt Silben wie Kalaschnipatron'n
Rapp' von Bikini Bottom, Planktonweed und Koks
Zu viel Fehlinvestments, ich musste mein Money wieder hol'n
Voller Hass und Aggression – Angriff auf den Thron
Massen sind krass am blow'n, jetzt soll Sunny wieder flow'n?
Der beste Fuffi meines Lebens: die Maske bei Amazon
Mafiaattitüde, per Hand Mimik wie Pantomime
Tickte weiter Planktontüten anonym im Schwammkostüm
Ihr seid heiß auf meine Identität
Kids analysier'n jeden Videoframe, um mich in 'ner Spiegelung zu sehen
Es hieß, SpongeBOZZ dreht am Osnabrücker Bahnhof wie Sun Diego
Rappt die Parts so wie Sun Diego, Chucks sind schwarz wie bei Sun Diego
Bezahlte Videos durch Yayo, nie geblasen für ein Demo
Zu schade für mein Ego, started from the Bottom wie'n Torpedo

[Part 3]
Die Szene liegt im Krankenhaus gebrochen
Denn sie hat die Meldung „zwanzigtausend Boxen“ wie 'ne blanke Faust getroffen
Das Rezept ist: weiter, obwohl sie nicht an dich glauben, droppen
Dann kann dich auch nix stoppen
Nie ein A&R gewesen
Aber schlau genug, das Biz ohne Labelerfahrung eben auf Majorbasis zu regeln
War kein Marketingbiest
Aber jahrelange Erfahrung im Straßenvertrieb – simple Mathematik
Übertrag' das Prinzip aufs Musikspiel vom Streetspiel
Ich behandelte Vertriebsdeal wie'n Weeddeal
Damals wollte niemand investieren in Spongie
Also nahm ich bei Soulfood 'ne halbe Mio auf Kombi
Zwischen Rapbattles mit Applechefs Geschäftsessen, kein Management
Selber den Stress gehandelt, Dentagangstarap auf Nextlevel
Denn „echter Selfmademan“ heißt kein'm Labelchef ein'n Prozent schenken
Bei mir blieb mehr an 'ner CD häng'n als nach Peppsessions
Morgens Meetings wegen Pressung von CDs
Abends Meetings wegen Pressung von dem Schnee
Hab' die Hoodscheiße satt, schreib' die Hooklines bei Nacht
Fick das Rapgame, ich bin ein Hybrid aus Suge Knight und Pac
Hab' mein Leben weggeschmissen, um hier jeden wegzuficken
Jeder macht 'ne Show, Verräter macht auf Bro
In der Trainingsjacke Blow, dieses Leben macht mich cold
Bitch, das Einzige, was für mich zählt, ist Media Control

[Hook 3: SpongeBOZZ & Sample / beides]
Started from the bottom, now we here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Zwanzig Jahre Loch im Magen, um heut „Masel tov“ zu sagen
Started from the bottom
Startete von unten, um den Status Gold zu jagen
Started from the bottom
Ein G, der die gold'ne Platte jagt
Bikini-Bottom-Mafia
Heut regnet's Krabbenkokanasen
We started from the –, started from the bottom

[Part 4]
Sie dominier'n mit Stanniflows die Hitlist, nur Junkiehoes im Business
Scheine regnen in die Labelkassen – money over bitches
Und heute muss ich nicht mehr verticken, Drogen verpacken
Dank der ersten Rapmillion'n auf Nickelodeons Nacken
Mit der Premiere die Szene gebangt, zerlegte die Konkurrenz
Meine CD geht Top-Ten, aber dann kommt die BPjM
Sie schickten mir Post, denn sie wollen nicht, dass mein Planktonweed blüht
Ich schlief in der Schallschutzkabine für mein Albumdebüt
Wegen „A.C.A.B.“ die Kritik und Meinung verdrängt
Der Antragsteller war sogar der Polizeipräsident
Per Gericht aus dem Handel
Zehn Jahre Blut, Schweiß und Trän'n, um nach sechs Monaten auf dem Index zu landen
Dein Sohn war Dealer, doch wollt' Mama stolz machen mit Rap
Und als Erfolge kamen, nahmen sie mein'n Goldstatus weg
Prophezeih' jetzt den Krieg, Koks und Nine in den Jeans
Auf der Kugel steht dein Name, Polizeichef Ber—

Damals Dope auf den Streets, heute Flows auf den Beats
Ich hab's nicht mehr nötig, doch verkauf' das Coke aus Prinzip
Mit sechs besucht' ich Dad im Knast, mit zwanzig Start als Koksbaron
Karmarotation – wie der Vater, so der Sohn
29. August, Schicksalsstunde
Bin fast gestorben beim Recorden von der King-Final-Runde
Egal, der Schmerz im Gehirn wird bis es fertig wird vom Herz ignoriert
Weil ein God of Battle eher stirbt als erbärmlich verliert
Rückrunde, in zwei Wochen Videoabgabedeadline
Ich schrieb den gesamten Text liegend im Krankenbett
Und heute sticheln sie in Songs mit circa zwanzigtausend Klicks
Damals hab' ich sie noch halbtot aus dem Krankenhaus gefickt
2014 woll'n sie Druck mit Mordanschlägen machen
Ist es Zufall, dass gleichzeitig beide Vorderräder platzen?
Wegen Neid, Fame und Geld
Frau am Steuer und daneben sitzt mein zweijähriger Nel – highway to hell
Sie geh'n nachts ans Auto, währenddessen schreib' ich grade Phrasen
Für Kleidung, etwas im Magen, und die Einrichtung zu zahlen
Schlangen schleimen auf der Straße
Lächeln ins Gesicht, doch hinterm Rücken Reifensabotage, ich weiß nicht, wer sie waren
Denn im Umfeld sind Ratten aus den dunkelsten Schatten
Doch sie mussten es schaffen, weil sie'n Schutzengel hatten
Blutrache, find' ich heute die Täter
Denn zwischen Gutenachtlied und Knast liegt 'ne Neunmillimeter

Ich musste aus 'nem zerbrochenen Elternhaus am Tiefpunkt starten
Alleinerzieh'nde Mum, ständig war Dad im Bau – Familiendram'n
Leerer Bankaccount, doch Miete zahlen
Durch ihren Exmann auch Kredite zahlen – sie war 'ne Kämpferfrau seit vielen Jahren
Deshalb fünf Uhr morgens Fensterbau bei Minusgraden
Danach Videodrehs, pumpte den Gangstersound in Tiefgaragen
Weedplantagen, Dealermargen
Sagte meiner Mutter: „Das sind Gelder aus Profitanlagen.“
Über Nacht 'ne Mio Klicks auf Videoclips
Aber dafür kilometerweit fahr'n, eingequetscht in 'nem Clio zwischen Stativen beim Giodiss
Machte mit Plankton für die Miete meines Studios Geld
Kein Streetcinema – damals war alles do-it-yourself
Kein Budget, deshalb in der Nachbarschaft verticken
Und trotz selbstgebautem Kameraequipment noch geschafft, alles zu ficken
Bad to the bone, friss die Tecmunition!
Was du rappst für den Thron? Bitch, ich rapp' für mein'n Sohn!

Apocalyptic

[Part 1]
Gotta killin' 'em, Lebensziele groß
Guck, in jeder Szene reales Koks
Bullen wollen auf die Beydadealer los
Sponge zu dem BOZZ, zehn Policemen tot
Krabbencoke weiß, Hautfarbe gelb
Milli schwarz, Weg bis hierhin rot
Tick' an deine Wannabe-Tony-Montanas
Immer noch die Jay-Packs für den Code
Starte die Apocalyptic
Schwarzer Gallardo, das Gaspedal durchgedrückt, Bitch
Warnung, ihr Snitches, satan el diablo – sag hallo zur Piff-Piff
Magnum-Ammo zerfickt dich
Familie Saado beschützt mich
Keiner, der Gage abdrückt für arabischen Rücken
Mafiosostatus im Blitzlicht
Star, doch privat 8k und AK auf dem Rücksitz (Apocalyptic)
Kille Rap, in den Adern Adrenalin
Millimètre durchgeladen, die Spinner flieh'n
Dämonenblut in meinen Venen, komm' aus der Hölle
Mit einer motherfuckin' Armada, mach Platz da
AK-47, Hass im Bauch, ich rast' aus
Amateure machen Spastensound, die Masse kauft
Eine Bullet für die Klassenclowns im Waffenlauf
Und die Szene geht in Flammen auf wie'n Drachenmaul (Apocalyptic)
Lilane zähl'n, denn nur Lilane zähl'n
Ich schwöre: niemals im Leben Peace mit der widerlichen Szene
Denn wenn du Beef hast mit den'n
Läuft im Hintergrund Kanakenpolitik ab wie bei Al Jazeera in Shishacafés
Doch das lässt mich kalt, so wie das Klimagerät
Des tiefergelegten Alpina-Beamer-Coupés
Denn wenn wir nach 'ner Brise Cocaine dein'n Kiefer zertreten
Wirst du beim VIVA-Comet wiederbelebt wie der Bibelprophet
Und dann kannst du weiter auf G machen geh'n
Und in Liedern erzählen vom Dealerstreethustleleben
Bitch, doch im Real lass' ich's Kiezklatschen regnen, zieh' die MGs
Es ist der G-Schwamm, der Skimaske plus Machineguns in Jeansjacken trägt (Apocalyptic)
An dessen gelber Faust gleich ApoReds Lidschatten klebt
Du Biatch wirst niedergemäht
Von 'nem G, der, wenn ich ihm ein Kokainapaket und zwei Speedbubbles geb'
Deine Gliedmaßen wie Peaceplatten zersägt und in mein'n Briefkasten legt (Apocalyptic)
Wenn es „Bastard“ heißt im Rap, wird mit Axt das Bein zerfetzt
Dann wird die Mafiascheiße echt – Butterflyeffekt
Kugeln aus den Murciélagos
Fick das Game, denn hier spielt jeder Hur'nsohn den Pablo wie Wagner Moura in Narcos
Sie feiern unrasierte, Bier exende Hartz-IV-Fressen
Ich muss mich mit keinem von euch messen, ihr müsst euch mit mir messen
Kellerinsekten übersetzen aus englischen Texten
Marc Jacobs – ich leg' Rapper in Ketten
Beretta auf Blender, Gangstervendetta, Messerstecherbandana
Erst Stressergangbanger, dann Hannah Montana
Jetzt macht jeder jämmerliche Pennerrapper im Keller auf Sänger
Hier wird Drake gebitet wie beim Sex mit Rihanna (Apocalyptic)
Straighter Takeover hier
Denn heut besteht das Game aus Fakehoes, die Drake-Flows kopier'n, wenn sie die Tapes produzier'n
Nur noch Bluffer im Rap, Möchtegerntrap
Ich durchlöcher' dein'n Head mit der neuf millimètre (Apocalyptic)
Eh, diese Inzestrapper
Klauen bei Kanye West wie die Kimkidnapper
Erst tun sie als wenn sie Kilodealer sind
Und dann wird Kanyes Style ausgelutscht wie beim POV mit Kim
Teckugelregen auf die Drecksschwulenszene
Keine Mode, ich trag' Ultraboosts, um Swagdudes zu treten
Yeezyseason, Rap besteht aus femininen Schwuchteln
Ich trag' Oversizepullover, um das Heroin zu schmuggeln
Mit Familienkreisprotection, sie woll'n street sein in Texten
Doch hatten nie eine Action, um das im Reallife zu backen
Seit wann machen diese Fake-MCs mit Schnee Profit?
Ich schwör' auf alles, ich mach' Beydadeals wie Geberit
Die Studentenrapper machen in Raptexten auf Zuhälter
Doch sind in echt Intelligenzbestien wie Bruce Banner
Drogenbossflow – du kriegst Patronenshots, Hoe
Hier fliegen Kugeln im hohen Bogen wie bei Pokémon Go
Ah, die Crackbitches sind laut am Mic
Doch jeder muss beim Clan abdrücken – Rapbusiness ist Counter-Strike
Deutsche Rapper zahlen Schutzgeld an Mafia
Ich hab' Mafiabackground wie das GoodFellas-Cover
Der Flur im Knast war der Werdegang, dich zerballern Gewehre, Punk
Wenn ich will, schickt meine Mafia achtzig Mann aufs Konzert mit Gun
Rapper machen auf Ehrenmann
Aber bei Streit kommt's zu politischen Debatten mit Kanaken wie Erdoğan
Nutte, ich bezahle mit Casinogeldern den Kilopreis
Im Miobereich an Amigos im Gambinogangsterfamilienkreis
Ich zersieb' dich mit Blei, Rapper sind am Mikro Banger, im Reallife nein
Sie drücken bei den Hells ab wie Bandidosmember bei Schießerei'n (Apocalyptic)
Londonimporte, Hongkongimporte
Doch mach' mehr Para mit der Maske als das Horrorfilmgenre
Drogen- und Steuerfahnder klingeln, sie woll'n Moneyflow entdecken
Stell'n die Wohnung auf den Kopf – DiCaprio, Inception (Apocalyptic)
Zwar nicht infiziert mit Aids, doch niemand fickt mit mir im Game
Denn ich laufe durch die Disco mit der Milli wie Lil Wayne
Siebzehn Schüsse in dein Brain; Bitch, ich kille Gs, ich schlitze sie
Mit Klingen wie in Trinity, der Trilogie von Blade
Sie indizier'n mein Tape, diese Industrie ist fake
Wieso singen diese Bitch-MCs wie Drizzy zu dem Drake?
Billigvideos dreh'n, dann dissen sie für Fame
Heut wissen sie: wer mit mir fickt, kann sein Gesicht verlier'n wie Bane
Wenn du Beef willst mit uns, rechne mit 'nem sechzigminütigen Diss
Nachdem Julien dich Hurensohn mit 'ner Rapanalyse zerfickt
Nach 'nem Schwammdiss hasst mein Gegner sein'n Spiegel
Ich hätte fünfzig Mio Klicks, wäre mein Gegner bei Spiegel (Apocalyptic)
Wenn du erfolglos mit dei'm Shit, aber Vollprofi bist
Denken Hoes, sie dürfen biten und dann Gold hol'n damit
Seid ihr stolz auf mich?
Ich rede von Sun-Diego-Level, ob ihr wollt oder nicht (Apocalyptic)
Ich hab' jahrelang gelitten, diesen Tune zu etablier'n
Damit irgendwelche Husos in der Zukunft profitier'n
Sunnycomeback wäre Nightmare für Rapper
Baddreams, bye-bye! Kein Neid mehr für Rapper (Apocalyptic)
Wer hat Trap hier hingebracht? Ich zeigte Germany den Sound
Rapper kenn'n die Differenz – damals hieß es Dirty-South (I'm so hood, Apocalyptic)
Früher gab es für mein'n Rapshit keine Löhne
Heute macht es jeder – Autotune und Trap sind meine Söhne (Apocalyptic)
War nie Soundproduzent, aber machte Audiospur'n fresher
Seit 2006: Sun, erster deutscher Autotunerapper (Apocalyptic)
Heut spitten Straßenkids Playershit
Ich werd' in der Szene kopiert – Matrix, Agent Smith (Apocalyptic)
Wieso besteh'n denn ihre Alben aus Clubhits?
Ich seh' die Charts heute – Falten von Hasskicks (Apocalyptic)
Millionen durch Rap, doch könn'n nicht mal Chorusse texten
Ich brauchte nie 'ne Hookbitch, um meine Vision umzusetzen

[Part 2]
Meine Hater wollen kotzen, meine Fans, sie wollen Mucke
Meine Gegner wollen Rache, meine Freunde wollen gönnen
Meine Feinde wollen sterben, meine Brüder wollen killen
Meine Frau nur meine Liebe, meine Mutter meine Ziele
Meine Oma meine Bildung und mein Sohnemann den Papa
Dicker, fuck it, denn ich geh' so lange weiter meinen Weg alleine
Fick auf alle, jage meine goldene Platte
We started from the bottom, motiviert zum Übernehmen (Apocalyptic)
Stepp' in die Kabine, baller' Silben in den Beat, um alle Rekorde der Welt mit einer Single zu brechen
Und by the way 'nen Gruß an Eminem und alle meine choppers on the way
You gotta listen now we're speedin' up in Germany
Schnellster Rapper hier plus Erfinder des Reversetimepuncher
Harley Davidson – ich bin worldwide Chopper
Hazespliffer vom Kush fly, Tectrigger gepullt, high
Sechs Schüsse ins Brustbein; stoned, aber treffsicher wie Bullseyes
Ziel' und fick' Wackspitter mit Kunsthype
Bullettime, umkreis' Bullerei, Schuss fly fulltime, Hoodlife, Bullen ein Schluck Blei, Goodbye – Rapkiller wie Suge Knight
Teeniepopattrappen, ihr könnt sie vom Fließbeton abkratzen
Wir zieh'n die Machinegun im Beef und durchsieben MCs ihre Yeezybomberjacken
Mein Team ist Bikini-Bottom-Mafia-Musik, wir sind real, meine Gs inhalieren das Weed
Aber schießen bei Streetpolitik, die Mitglieder sind Dealerblockkanaken (Apocalyptic)
Massive, stabile Stofferkanten, die Stiere trainier'n aggressiv, Steroid injiziert
Tätowiert mit Monsternacken, ich ziel' aus dem Jeep, auf die Zivilcopbeamte
Zieh' die Shotgun, lande mehr Hits no-look als dieser Stevie Wonder, Schlampe! (Apocalyptic)

[Part 3]
Ficke Rapper, die mit Fake-G-Images und Gaypiepstimmen
Über Drakebeats singen und wie Ladys klingen
Alles sei Comedy, sagen die Medienportale, wir holten mit dem Planktonweed Tape
Eins ohne Pop oder kommerzieller Mainstreamsingle
Ohne Radiohits, ohne Heavyrotation
Schelle für Kay One – Heavyrotation
Zerfetze dann mit dem Basey das vom Handy Cocaine sniffende
Babyface mit Aids und verbrenn' die Location
Kill 'em all, ich hab' die Guncollection
Boom boom boom boom – Schwammconnection
Starte kein'n Twitterbeef, habe kein Killermotiv
Aber die Rapper, die geben mir 'nen Grund, sie einfach anzustechen
Badabang badabang, baller' meine Bang, alle renn'n
Kille deine Gang vor den Fans, wir lassen Eventhallen brenn'n
Polier' meine Felgen am Benz, Motherfucker, enter' das Game
Mit der Family BBM-Gangster, wir sprengen dein Camp
Von der Soko gesucht, für mich ist homo tabu
Doch bang' für Promo deine Crew wie paar Hoes von Lovoo
Schalldämpfer, Polohandschuh, meine Kanone macht kabumm
Zwei Patronen für die Os von eurem Yolo-Tattoo
Mach' keine dicken Millionen, aber zerficke Ikonen, verticke die Drogen, beginnen am Boden
Doch Wille nach oben, ich nehm' mir die Krone
Schieß' auf Bitches Patronen, lass' die Szene brenn'n wie Christopher Nolan bei Filmexplosionen
Schwarzer Gallardo, Beifahrer Salah Saado ballert die Kalash Ammo
Mafia, el chapos, Bastardssohn, mach nicht auf Vato, Shots aus der Glock in dein Camo
Money zähl'n, der Staat ist mir wayne
Kein'n Cent auf Bank, doch im Ferrari zu seh'n wie Ali Al-Zein, ah
Welche Hoe will mich beefen? Die komischen Freaks deiner Homies kassieren
Ich geb' dir 'ne Bombe, du fühlst dein Gesicht nicht mehr so wie The Weeknd
Makarowclips auf die Bitches, ich lass' eure Köter verbluten
Freunde von Niemand, Söhne von Huren

[Part 4]
Stoffvercheckerrapshit, no Storyteller, Topseller
Im Hobbykeller press' ich Jay wie Roc-a-Fella Records
Offiziell an Wochenenden locker Tonnen Flex in Packets
Weil sie mehr Gs zieh'n als Dagi Bees Fotzen ableckender Kofferschlepperfaggot
Shotguntrefferhattrick
Ich schieß' Karate Andi, 257ers und Genetikk von der Jobbingcentertreppe
Unterm Bosssweater 'ne Gatling
Denn hier macht jeder Opferrapper, der'n Prospectmember kennt, in Songs auf Rockerpräsident, Bitch [(Apocalyptic)](11149462)
Flowbiter, komm her!
Die Schwammkarriere ist nur Zeitverschwendung? Das sagt mir der Ghostwriter von Fler!
Trip nimmt jeden Featurepart mit Kusshand, die Bitch
Der erste Rapper, der mehr Pussy als die Hookschlampe ist (Apocalyptic)
Ah, ich nehm' MoTrips Hoe mit zu mir
Und krieg' Blowjobs von ihr wie'n Kokakurier
Die Brille Jochen strippt für dich nach Shows auf Klo, du Piçrapper
Dein Cock wird durch die Figur von JokA groß wie Heath Ledger
Der erste Rapper, der's MoTrip besorgt
Denn sein Popoloch ist für JokAs Cock ergonomisch geformt
Traust dich vor Kamera zu sprechen, bis die Araber dich stechen
Denn vor Mafiaclanconnection kann kein Panzerglas protecten
Lass die Kampfansagen stecken
Denn mein größter Kampf ist in mir selber nicht den Ha-Satan zu wecken
Dein Kiefer gebrochen, Projektile fliegen durch Knochen
Schüsse aus der Fourtyfour für das Vierauge Jochen (Apocalyptic)
Rapper fahr'n die Pablo-Escobar-Schiene
Du wirst gejagt durch Westberlin, es hagelt Tecprojektile
Was will Flizzy? Guck, wie ich die Nazicrackhoe durchsiebe
Bitch, ich hab' Mordmotive wie die Charlie-Hebdo-Satire (Apocalyptic)
Sami Slimani, ich schieß' Bullets auf dein'n Kussmund, du Hur'nkind
Und dann kannst du Tutorials machen, wie man Schusswunden zuschminkt
Kein Cover der Juice, keine Kameracrews, keine Schwamminterviews
Fick auf die Wannabe-Hip-Hop-Reporter, nur einer stand hinter mir – danke an Rooz! (Apocalyptic)
Jeder guckt Franzosenmusikvideos und covert
BBM-Krabbenkokaindealer mit Kalash
Hier werden Patronen von Street-Gs abgeballert
Niko und Falk Schacht – sie sind abstoßende Realkeeper wie Navas (Apocalyptic)
Ich hab' 187 für dein 31er-Team
Plus 'ne Ladung Swag für Money Boy im Ninemagazin
Essen-City-Ghetto, wir messern dich, du Crackhoe
Und dann leiden deine Gliedmaßen durch Trennung wie Alessio

[Payback #forsundiego]

[Part 1]
Du traust dich nicht, wie'n Mann zu beefen, mich richtig anzuschießen
Deshalb habt ihr wie Bitches zusammen „Hit 'em up“ geschrieben
Und erzähl das den Fans, kein'm ehemaligen Bruder
Der Schemata und Strukturen schon seit zehn Jahren kennt
Trau dich: Disstrack gegen Disstrack – für den Shit würd' ich draufgeh'n
Bossaura 2 – du kannst es nicht mit mir aufnehm'n
Du hast die Scheiße begonnen, also bring es zu Ende
Doch du hast keine Cojones, euer King ist Legende
Streetcinema – check! 18 Minuten – check!
Karottenstory – check! Takt treffen …
Breite Figur plus Sixpack, wow!
Kollegah macht 18 Minuten Disstrack für 13 Minuten Impact
Und denk bitte nicht, du hättest in dem Battle 'ne Chance
Dicker, Flizzy hat den Beef mit einer Sperrung gewonn'n
Merkst du, wie dein Hype langsam stirbt?
Weil selbst ein Fler heutzutage besser den Vibe transportiert
Du machst Lauten in ganz Deutschland, große Flerdisszerstörung
Aber triffst dann nicht den Takt wie bei Herzrhythmusstörung
Lass den Rapbattleshit! Mach den weltmännischen Pelzmäntelnshit
Denn du fickst dich doch nur selbst, wenn du disst
Ein 31-jähriger, scheine-zählender Breitlingträger
Doch Talent kann man nicht kaufen – du hast Timingfehler
Peinlich, Kollegah! Du hast im Radio 'ne Show!
Hallo Deutschland, erster Hip-Hop-Act mit Platin ohne Flow!
Achtzig Mille in 'nem Video, doch die Silben nicht im Beat
Teure Produktion'n kaschieren  billige Musik
Und von Single zu Single verlierst du Status als Rapper
Denn musikalisch war sogar der Typ vom Babo Bus besser
Mach den Thron frei, du Blender, du warst mal ein so nicer Texter
Doch am Mikrofon bleibst du schlechter, heute wärst du als Ghostwriter besser
Scoute lieber nach Newcomern bei der Bahnhofsmission
Denn deine Lyrics war'n routinierter von Majoe geflowt
Du stichelst, weil ich mich nicht abzieh'n lass' bei Selfmadeprojekten
Und dir die Stirn biete wie Seyed Fresh auf Backstagetoiletten
Und was für Hoodstraßen, Felix? Was für Schusswaffenfetisch?
Du hast maximal ein'n Fetisch für dein'n Lustknaben Seyed
Machtwechsel, Mois!
Du dachtest, du machst es mit 'nem krass schlechten schwach und enttäuschendem Album des Transgenderboys
Aber sag, was für Plattenverkäufe?
Es ist höchstens Seyed in Stilettos, wenn bei Alpha was mit Absätzen läuft
Bosshaftcrew, jeder hat sein Karma verdient
Entleer' das AK-Magazin auf dein Jasagerteam
Kollegahdisstrack, jede Bar killt sofort
Ich zerlege den Mac wie der Gravissupport
Apropos Comeout mit zwölf, was war denn 2011?
Der Polake hat ein'n Dreh, sagt „Komm vorbei im Bordell“
Auf engstem Raum mit Schwänzen, nackte Körper, Jacuzzi
Besser Comingout mit zwölf als im Whirlpool mit Toony
Er nimmt Bäder mit Hools
Zwar kein Billardzocker, doch mit Schlägern im Pool – Kollegah ist schwul!
Lass die Kanadamärchenschiene
Der Heuchler verstellt sich in Interviews wie die Kameraperspektive
Machst auf Mac in dem Business und verblendest die Kids mit
Einer scheiß Kanadiershow wie Terrance und Phillip
Dann ist der Schwamm aufgetaucht
Für das, was ich mit einem Tape geschafft hab', hast du fast zehn Jahre Anlauf gebraucht
Kollegah hat mich nie in meinem Rapstyle bereichert
Und was „Idol“? Wir haben einfach beide Tech N9ne gefeiert
Wrong turn, wieso startest du Palaver mit mir, Stricher?
Ich schneid' Kollegahs Kopf ab – kanadische Bar Mitzwa
Felix erzählt nix als Lügen
Du warst höchstens mal im Pusherbiz durchs Vermakten von Trainingsanzügen
Und sobald er paar Kokainnasen zieht
Wird er zu einer von Drogen labernden flowschwachen Parodie der Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
Tech N9ne, Busta Rhymes, Twista
Bitest überall und machst auf Westsidedoubletimespitter
Zerfetzt die Rapindustrie
Wie die aus dem Englischen Texte übersetzende, schlechte Cam'ron-Kopie
Mach nicht auf Businessman, Kollegah, du verpickelter Brillenträger
Vertickst kein Beyda, du bist nur ein Dipsetfan, Kollegah
Sagst, du bist Zuhälterrapper wie Juelz Santana
Doch du bist Felix Blume außerhalb vom Studiokeller
Hol dir 'ne Schutzweste, Kolle, du machst kein Hoodcash mit Knollen
Bitch, du machst höchstens Cash mit Puder als Zec+-Testemonial
Komm' mit Arabermafia mit Glocks, es hagelt Ballermannshots
Wenn du halbkanadischer Almanspast wie dein Bodyguard auf Pascha machst
Das Gesicht der blonden Bitch, den Schminkkoffer im Griff
Ey, Kollegah färbt den Bart wie der Simpsonscolorist
Stürm' die Muckibude mit Gun und dann kuscht die Hure aus Angst
Denn die Bosstransformation macht keine Pussy zu 'nem Schwanz
Damals auf Dorfstraßen versteckt
Und erst nachdem 'ne Gold'ne kam, in'n Sportwagen gesetzt und stolz sein'n Vornamen gerappt
Was macht der Chorknabe auf Mac?
Du fährst Tourbus er Turbo zehn Jahre rappen für den Porsche eines Jugobetrugo
Charteinstiege, doch im Düsseldorfer Ghetto gelebt
Am Ende der Projekte netto sechzig Cent pro CD
Erfolg macht dich nicht zu 'nem Mann, wenn du dich jahrelang verbiegst
Wenn das Gesicht von einer Bitch sich in den Platinplatten spiegelt
Was für Ehrenmann mit Spenden? Ein paar Mille investiert
In dein Image investiert und mit „King“ Triple kassiert
Das Business floriert, Krieg in Nahostgebieten
Während mehrere Million'n auf sein'n Privatkonten liegen
Du nimmst dir selten Zeit, Fans und Supporter zu treffen
Zu sehr beschäftigt, deine scheiß Echoawards anzulächeln
Alles fake, das sieht man daran, wie die Nummer verpackt ist
Die Platte ist Platin, doch alles drumherum Plastik
Du bist kein Wohltäter, kein Kron'nträger
Doch eine Frage: Wieso reimt sich Kollegah auf Flowfehler?
Jeder leckt dein'n Arsch, doch dass du leider nicht erkennst
Das ist alles GfK, keiner feiert dich als Mensch
Für mich war'n wir Brüder bis dato
Doch dann erfahr' ich: du sagst „SpongeBOZZ ist Sun Diego!“ auf der Bühne mit Majoe
Geb' dir'n lyrisches K.o
Ein psychisches und physisches K.o. wie beim Berlinauftritt die Typen von Aggro
Bis heut seit Tag eins geschwiegen
Ich hab' dir damals meine Lage beschrieben, du hattest Jahre, um es gradezubiegen
Ich hab' kein'n Cent verdient, du machtest ein'n Haufen Geld
Bitch, ich schreibe diesen Disstrack schon seit 2011
Der letzte Respekt ist kaputt, ich textete Nächte die Hooks
Du hast von mei'm Teller gegessen und auf die Reste gespuckt
Ich gab den Tune, den du suchtest, ich gab mein Blut in der Booth
Wieso redest du von Businessmoves im Juiceinterview?
Wir war'n nicht mehr connectet seit Jahren
Deshalb musste Selfmade-Elvir mich fragen, dass ich dir helfe zu charten
Du hast bei mir gewohnt, fast ein Jahr für die Platte gebraucht
Doch dann ging die Hälfte vom Albenverkauf für Anwälte drauf
Die and're Hälfte an Stas, nicht mehr melden, das war's
Deal ist Deal – ich wollte einfach nur mein Geld plus Vertrag
Bei 'nem gemeinsamen Projekt teilt man das Cash allein aus Respekt
Doch das fiel dir leichter als 2006 das Mic aufm splash!
Ich war jung, hab' getextet, hungerte hunderte Nächte
Elvir hat die Unterschrift gesetzt, du hast die Nummer gewechselt
Ich hab' mit Umsatz gerechnet, denn als wir Songs recordet hatten
Hat meine Mum für dich gekocht und deine Boxershorts gewaschen
Wie viel' Jahre musst' ich Bitchmoves von dir Cocksauger dulden?
Eine Stunde Payback für die Bossauraschulden
Du schluckst mein'n Teclauf
Kollegah, wenn du nicht mit deinem Arsch bezahlen kannst, stell mit dei'm Mund kein'n Scheck aus!
Was willst du machen, Felix? Wo hat der Schwamm 'ne Schwäche?
„SpongeBOZZ ist Sun Diego“ gegen zehn Jahre Angriffsfläche?
Wen willst du ficken? Zehn Jahre Karriere
Affären, Verträge – dein Leben, ich hab' Insiderwissen
Vor dem Beef kann dich kein Weltrekord und Rapaward beschützen
Keine Nominierung – diesmal komm'n die Echos von den Schüssen
Mach' die Verleihung mit der Clique zu 'ner Drive-by-Kulisse
Die letzten Auszeichnungen werden deine Kreideumrisse
Du willst Maßstäbe setzen wie beim Quadratmetermessen
Bitch, ich werd' dich nicht dissen – ich werd' deine Grabrede rappen!
No way back – ich will, dass es ausartet, zu spät für dich
Denn draußen wartet jeder auf 'nen Tausend-Bars-Kollegahdiss",SpongeBOZZ,1963,"[92, 85, 86, 78, 78, 83]",6
289,Your Baby's Gone Surfin',"Well, I called up my baby
On the telephone
It just kept ringing
No one was home

Then I saw my best friend
And her face turned red
When I asked my best friend
This is what she said

Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing and I know where
Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing and I know where

He's down at the beaches
Beaches, beaches having fun
Your baby's gone surfing
Surfing, surfing, like everyone

Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing to the surfing band
Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing to the guitar man

Your baby's gone dancing
Dancing, dancing, having fun

Dancing with everyone

Oh, your baby is dancing
Whoa, he's dancing
Whoa, he's dancing

296,When A Boy Falls In Love,"I've heard them say love was a wonderful things
Something you couldn't hide on a shelf
But for me they no longer have to explain
Because I know for myself

He awakens each morn with a smile on his face
When a boy is in love
And the world to him is a beatiful place
When a boy is in love
He's up and he's gone
There's no breakfast for him
Cause he lives on the love of his sweet little gem
The days not through, though it's not very long
Before he must talk to his girl on the phone
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

His girl's voice on the phone brings him wondrous delight
When a boy is in love
If there's been any darkness, it all fades from sight
When a boys in love
He can hardly wait til the moment they meet
For he knows when he sees her his day will be complete
When they're finally alone and he kisses her lips
The world sings a love song and his heart turns a flip
That's how it is when a boy falls in love

At the end of the day the time comes they must part
The strings of regret tear away at his heart
And late in the night as he sleeps on his bed
Visions of her sweet song, how they dance in his head
And before you know he is buying a ring
To capture forever that sweet darling thing
That's how it is when a boy falls in love
That's how it is when a boy falls in love",Sam Cooke,1963,"[59, 44, 45, 47, 47, 53, 56, 68, 79, 84]",10

One for the occasion and get ya good suit

Look at where you came from, Californication
Since a little baby skating in boogie boards and raiding your
Cookie jar, my radio analog, I wanted them
Nikes, mama got me Lugz (and all)

This one's for all the little dreamers
And the ones who never gave a fuck

Mama always kept the cable on
I'm a product of the tube and the free lunch
Living room, watching old reruns

Who would be defunct? Which rumours would be debunked?

Till I woke up from this nightmare
Now what become of a dream deferred, now until we leave this earth
The music make your speakers burst, I always put my people first
It's deep how when I speak they say I'm preaching like I lead a church

To show you how to struggle poetic and make it lyrical
Crystallize the thought to make it clear to you
And make the revolution irresistable

304,My Whole World Is Falling Down,"My whole world is falling down
My whole world is falling down
I wake up in the mornings, I think I want a drink
I can’t even get water, from the kitchen sink
The dog that we both loved and raised from a pup
Tried to bite my hand lord every time I pick him up

[Chorus]
Because I need you more
My whole world is falling down ooh yeah
Crumbled around, all around

All your tears and my hard work, we built the home we live
I turned my back on you, when you had so much love to give
Now this home is just a house, a place to lay my head
The roof must have a leak Lord, ‘cause its raining in my bed

[Chorus]
I never knew that you would need me
Even though you’ve been mistreated
How to know your love is needed now

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, I don’t get no sleep
Even a part time job Lord, is mighty hard to keep
I miss that evening meal that you used to cook
My clothes are hanging off me girl, you should see the way I live
Baby please don’t go, my whole world is falling down
Baby please don’t go, my whole world is falling down ooh yeah
Falling on down, crumbling all over
I need you so bad
Won’t you come home baby?

305,Easier Said Than Done,"[Verse 1]
From the start, I said it don't matter where your heart lies
It’s just a bit of fun
But it's easier said than done
'Cause I’m falling, but there's dreams to chase in the morning
So now is the time to run
But it's easier said than done

[Verse 2]
I'm away now, where you don't exist
Ooh, you're nice, trying not to miss someone
It's easier said than done
I left my feelings on your bedroom floor
Tangled up, I know I shouldn't call it done
But it’s easier said than done

[Chorus]
’Cause I don't wanna fight it, ooh
Oh, it got ahold of us, won’t let go
I guess it's decided, ooh
Oh, it got ahold of us, know I shouldn't be calling it love

[Verse 3]
Every night I'm tryna bite my tongue, but it’s too late
'Cause I am an honest drunk
So it's easier said than done
I surrender everything I got, tell the world
'Cause pretending you're not the one
It's easier said than done

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna fight it, ooh
Oh, it got ahold of us, won't let go
I guess it's decided, ooh
Oh, it got ahold of us, know I shouldn't be calling it love

But it's easier said than done
It's easier said than done
Oh, these feelings come so unpredictable
You never know, never know when
Hearts start beating out of our control

That lingers in your ear

From sundown to sunset

You hear it everywhere
No matter what you do
It's gonna grab a hold on you

They say the sun comes up every morning
And if you listen carefully
The winds that ride on the high time
Whistle a melody
And so the people started to sing
And that's how the surf gave birth untold

When you hear the beat
You wanna pat your feet
And you've got to move
Cause it's really such a groove

Puts a brand new kind of thinking in your mind
And you can't go wrong
Cause you're groovin' all day long
California soul, California soul

They had the melody and the beat
But it still didn't seem complete
Until they saw two lovers kissin'
They knew just what was missin'

So happy they were rockin' and reelin'

And I dreamed about those cottonfields and home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sisters and brothers
And I dreamed about a love who's been waiting there so long

I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home

My kinfolks think I'm big in Detroit city
From all the letters that I write, they think I'm fine
By day I make the cars, but by night I make on the bars
Oh if only they'd just read between the lines

They'd know I want to go home
I want to go home
Oh how I want to go home

You know I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
And after all these years I find I've just been wasting my time
Think I'll put my foolish pride on a southbound train and ride
Head on back to the loved ones I left there waiting there behind

I want to go home

[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

[Verse 1]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said ""No, you're handsome.""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
""Cool, where you stay?""
She said: ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" – ""No,"" she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
""What you tryin' to get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

[Verse 2]
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy

[Verse 3]
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang

Learning to enjoy at my leisure, all the simple pleasures

Lingering sunset, stay a little longer with the lonely sea
Children everywhere when you shoot at bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange enchanted land

Wandering rainbows leave a bit of color for my heart, to see
Stars in the sky, make my wish come true

Next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you
What my heart meant

Heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but
Who's to answer?

When the bell has sounded
The pier d'France

The beauty that is spring

Silk stockings thrown aside
Dance invitations

First daffodils
And long excited cables
And candle lights
On little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

And the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the
Last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Remind me of you

How strange, how sweet, to find you still
These things are dear to me
That seem to bring you so near to me

The wail of steamers

Walk like dreamers

How much I love him

Make the music play
Keep teh magic going
Keep the love-light glowing
Within his arms
Don’t even skip a beat

And if we were parted
I'd be broken-hearted
Til I’m in his arms to stay

Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

And it burns, burns, burns

319,Sometimes You Gotta Cry A Little,"Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little

When I was very young, my mother said to me
This world that we live in is so funny
One day, victory, one day, defeat
You gotta be a man to take the bitter with the sweet
'Cause sometimes

Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little

The further down the road as I grew up
I met a little girl and I fell in love
I thought I had her love all to myself
Until I found there was someone else
Said, I know

Sometimes you gotta love a little
Sometimes you gotta lie a little
Sometimes you gotta laugh a little
Sometimes you gotta cry a little

Now, it's all over, I forgot that girl
I think that I'm ready to face the world
One day, victory, one day, defeat
Now I can take the bitter with the sweet

322,It Won't Be This Way (Always),"[Verse 1: Pablo Falbru]
I can't face reality this time
So I’ll contest my fate tonight
If things don’t change, is this my destiny?
I must erase my insecurities

[Hook]
Consumed by my thoughts
My mind it slips away
A thin line is drawn
I think I’ve gone insane
I don’t know lust from love
It all feels the same
When will things change?
Or will it always be this way?

[Verse 2: Sur5ILL]
My country don’t know I’m a liar
Training won’t require that I’m not for hire to the highest buyer
Provided a disguise I’d be hiding on the fly
They confided in my lies while I’m spying on the spies
A secret’s not a secret if I’m the one that keeps it
I'm proposed a briefcase in exchange if I can leak it
Allegiance to cash flow is luring me
The notion of National Security’s a bastion of obscurity
Moviegoers would suppose I’m a Double-O
The fuck does the public know about a subtle ghost?
And I never ever leave clues, blood, or both
And I never botch mission undercover so
I have a dozen passports
I had to flee and use one of them after I bludgeoned my last corpse
Here’s some math for you stupid laymen:
I’m more than single, less than triple, and half of quadruple Agent

You let me hug you, let me kiss you

But my eyes don't lie to me

326,Till Then,"I never chose to love so sweet a rose
I suppose I was just made that way
Loneliness and gloom fills my lonely little room
Perhaps soon you’ll chase my emptiness away

'Till then I’ll wait
'Till you’ve reached my gate

Every day I wake it’s getting harder just to take
I try to fake a smile but nothing hides my sadness
Pretending that I’m fine I’m only lying all the time
I crossed the line from melancholy into madness

'Till then I’ll wait
'Till you’ve reached my gate
Lying every night
'Till you blessed my sight

I never knew what just one dance can do
Now I’m through with all my searching, love I found you

I will protect and put my loving arms around you

You look so good, oh babe, you must be bad, ha

Diamonds on your ankles, sapphires on your shoes
Your little gems of wisdom chase away my blues
Mama's little princess, daddy's pride and joy
I'm like a kid at Christmas, playing with your toys, ooh

You shake me in the morning, I wake up black and blue
Ooh child, you act so wild, I'll name a hurricane after you
Scarlet fever kisses, little Miss Dynamite
Youngblood, you look so good, I'm gonna leave on all the lights

So I can see where I'm goin', baby
Play that thing

So take me to your river, baby, take me to your sea
Purify my soul and pour your ocean over me

Lips any girl? Nah, that's not me

I put it all in the bin 'cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

It's the return of the mack
I'm still alive just like 2Pac
Girls in the front row, girls in the back
Spit one lyric, everybody's like brap
Flashback to the cold nights in the trap
Now I'm in a new whip counting the big stack
Yellow-gold chain and the diamonds are black
Jack me? Nah, you don't wanna do that
Anytime you see me wearing a glove
Boy Better Know I ain't coming to fight like Jet Li
Spray this 'til the clip is empty
I know you get what I'm saying, you get me?
Love for the G's in the ends
But we don't love no girls in the ends

Pricks wanna try and put Skepta on hold
But no, badboy, I've been one of those
Wake up call, you will get one of those
One to the eyeball, one to the nose
I don't really care about your postcode
Take your girl, no dinner, no rose
Two minutes in my bedroom, no clothes
Girls everywhere, girls in the club
Looking at me, tryna make a black man blush
Girls on the high street, girls on the bus
But these niggas wanna hang around us, that's sus
I don't wanna see a Stone Island, cuz
Man talk shit, I just smile and flush
I'm looking for a girl with an X factor
But I don't judge like Simon does

[Verse 3: Jme]
From day one, I said I was serious
Then ""Serious"" hit the jackpot
People ask what music I make
Turn the volume up cuz, that's what
I don't wear no bait designer brands
I spit deep bars in my black top
You'll never see me smoking a cigarette
Cah cigarette smoker, that's not me
Nah, that's not me, nah, that's not
When I'm on the mic in a rave
I got the whole crowd bubbling like a crack pot
See me and Skepta in a video with a nostalgic backdrop
There'll never be a day when I don't make music
'Cause silent? Nah, that's not me

That it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind
And this is what I heard my neighbor say

""That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst

She knows not to speak to me or my child""

A tongue can accuse and carry bad news
The seeds of distrust it will sow
But unless you've made no mistakes in your life
Be careful of stones that you throw

A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes
A sound that made my blood chill
For my neighbor's one child had been pulled from the path
And saved by a girl lying still

The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out
""Oh who was that brave girl so sweet?""

Ain't one thing that's the same, so much sorrow and pain
Headin' home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile
Ain't heard nobody sing, ain't seen one livin' thing

Someone's waitin' for me, honey sweet as candy
Wanna hold her tightLord, make her be all right
Maybe 'round on next bend, all the ashes of land
Valleys will be green instead of what I've seen

I'm afraid for the scrubby pine, for the sweet honeysuckle vine
I'm afraid for my home, for the fields that I roamed
Kick along down a homeward road, and your heart's gotta take the load

How I see you
How you are everything that I have

You are the fire to my thoughts
The spark that starts it all
And with your eyes you can move me to your world so far apart
If you die before I do
I know that heartache will kill me too
So if I ever lived again, it will be to find you

Where I can love you
I will love you
Until the blood all leaves these veins

So if you die before I do
I know the heartache will kill me too
So if I ever live again
It will be to find you

Where I will love you
I will love you
Until the blood all leaves these veins
Don't you let us
Don't you let us
Lose to an early grave
Give me a lifetime
And then fifty more
To find the words
That will never explain
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have
How I need you
How I see you
How you are everything that I have
How you are everything that I have

337,I Cried,"[Verse 1]
The night before I left
I walked her to the door to say goodbye
And I cried

So many tears I cried

I've never ever felt  so sad
I've never been in so much pain

338,Sukiyaki,"[Verse]
It's all because of you I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just a rainy day
I love you so, how much you'll never know
You've gone away and left me lonely
Untouchable memories seem to keep haunting me
Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue
But you disappeared, now my eyes are filled with tears
I'm wishin' you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do

[Chorus]
If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me, oh
If only you were here, you'd wash away my tears
The sun would shine, and once again you'd be mine, all mine
But in reality, you and I will never be
'Cause you took your love away from me
Oh, baby, you took your love away from
Me

To take me back and give me a try

347,Harry The Hairy Ape,"Well, a strange thing happened the other night
You won't believe it, but I swear it's true
Harry the hairy ape made his escape from the city zoo
And under cover of darkness he made his way
To the middle of the municipal park
And he hid in the bushes and waited for somebody to come
Walkin' along by himself in the dark

Then along come somebody not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest, jump up and down and he say
""Woo hoo hee hee hoo hoo""
Which is Harry ape talk for
""Boo, I betcha I scared you, ha ha""

Scared that poor cat so bad his eyes bugged out
His hair turned white
He ran off through the municipal park
Screamin', hollerin', tearin' up the shrub
Diggin' up the lawn and knock down the
Keep off the grass sign, run through the
Hurricane fence, fell into the municipal park
Swimming pool and drowned himself

Well, Harry thought this was the funniest thing
That he had ever seen and he laughed, ""Ha ha""
Jumped back in the bushes and got ready to do it again
The next guy to come along was the near sighted local DJ
Just boppin' down the sidewalk on his way to work
With a box of records on his arm that he was gonna play

So here come, not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest, jump up and down and he say
""Woo hoo hee hee hoo hoo""
Which is Harry ape talk for
""Boo, I betcha I scared you, ha ha""

Man, that radio announcer didn't even bad an eye
He was so near-sighted he thought
Harry was a rock 'n' roll singer
So he gave him the old glad hand
Slapped him on the back, smiled
Said, ""Don't worry, baby, I'm gonna play the record
Then he said, ""Bye"", bopped on off down the sidewalk
Every 4 5 steps he'd stop and doin' a little mash potatoes

Harry just stood there watching till he got out of sight
Man he didn't know what to think I mean it really shook him up
He run back to his cage as fast as he can go
And jump up on his little swing put both hands over his eyes
And didn't look for 3 hours and 45 minutes
But that's not the end of the story, no
Here's what happened

Well the DJ played Harry's record
What record?
Shut up it was a hit and he became a star
He got him some tight britches, got him a manager
Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back
And took up playin' the guitar
And every Sunday afternoon
You can go see Harry at the zoo
And the girls will scream and he'll sit on his swing
And pick and sing his hit record for you

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself:
""Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?""
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids: who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brothers
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start making changes
Learn to see me as ya brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take my brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change... and that's the way it is

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right
‘Cause both Black and White are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it's heaven-sent
There's still no change, even with a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact:
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way, but you staying in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Being real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Selling crack to the kids
""I gotta get paid!"", well hey, but that's the way it is

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
And still I see no changes
Can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops, can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my two
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always gotta worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Coming back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!"" That's the way it is

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right

[Outro: Michael Jackson, 2Pac]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
It's time for us as a people to start making some changes

And let's change the way we treat each other

352,One Fine Day,"Saw the wandrin' eye inside my heart
Shouts and battle cries from ev'ry part
I can see those tears, ev'ry one is true
When the door appears I'll go right through

I stand in liquid light, like ev'ryone
I built my life with rhymes to carry on
And it gives me hope to see you there
The things I used to know, that one fine-

One fine day
One fine day

In a small dark room, where I will wait
Face to face I find, I contemplate
Even though a man, is made of clay
Ev'rything can change, one fine-

One fine day...

Then before my eyes is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks one by one
I remove my masks when I am done

Then a piece of mind fell over me

355,Be True To Yourself,"You gotta show me gotta make see
You gotta give me one good reason
And just because they don't agree
It doesn't make them guilty of treason

You say we've got to fight fire with fire
We can never let them win
We got to build ourselves a funeral pyre
It's just the world that we're living in

You know everything changes
There can be no turning back
We're pointing guns in the faces of strangers
I hear the shout attack attack attack

It's a fine, fine deviding line
Between the truth and the lies sometimes
I don't know what you hope to find
I only know you got to be true to yourself

And no you're out there on the fields of glory
Fighting for my freedom
I know it sounds like the same old story
But you've got to stand up for what you believe in

You know everything changes
There can be no turning back
We're pointing guns in the faces of strangers
I hear the shout attack attack attack

It's a fine, fine deviding line
Between the truth and the lies sometimes
I don't know what you hope to find
I only know you got to be true to yourself

""Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white""
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take
The so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits, and maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't
Find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you ""stay inside the lines""
But something's better on the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible as long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing
As the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait 'til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for",John Mayer,1963,[97],1

This I know, 'cause it's...

Those tear drops, they won't fall again

Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear

All covered with cheese

When somebody sneezed

It rolled off the table
And onto the floor
And then my poor meatball
Rolled out of the door

It rolled in the garden
And under a bush
And then my poor meatball
Was nothing but mush

The mush was as tasty
As tasty could be
And early next summer
It grew into a tree

The tree was all covered
With beautiful moss
It grew lovely meatballs
And tomato sauce

So if you eat spaghetti
All covered with cheese

Or twice as nice, my summer love

The tides roll by and waves of love

Other loves may come tumbling down
Ours will last through eternity

366,Swinging On A Star,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig?

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He's got no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish?

A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought
And though he's slippery, he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo
Everyday you'll meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swingin' on a star",Bing Crosby,1963,"[43, 38, 38, 44, 45, 48, 54, 64, 75, 90]",10

372,Like The Big Guys Do,"[Intro]
[I wish I could go along with you, but I do have a problem. I've got
My (Soul!), but I can't find my (Damn Ho!)]

[Verse 1: Zev Love X]
Poor X, not only do I headsweat from headsets
Full-time Era come at X from knockin' Z's correct
Next step's to count sheep
But too many sheep ain't jumpin' hurdles, they sleep
Yeah, they sleep, I think I'll check a shorter story
Title: Bo's Ho, sound's boring, perfect for these
Sleepless nights, though I feel quite over-aged
Yeah, I know...turn the page

[Verse 2: Zev Love X]
(Ha-ha huh...let's begin!)
Book-marks the first page
And reads once upon an age in a far far land
Lived three farmers, Tom, Sam and Bo of course
From behind Tom's black fence Tom peeps across
Just to witness Sam's crop business
Boomin' like the big guy's, but get this
Sam sold to uncles and cousins, poor Tom crams
He sold his to get a fence like Sam (yeah)
Page 2: Sam view's the sight -
What goes at Bo's over his picket white
Slowly he peeks only to see Bo plantin'
Sweet potatoes with his brand new ho
Bo sees Sam but's not frettin', more sweatin'
Thinkin' about steppin' to the crib, forgettin'
'bout his brand new ho, Old Mickey D would say Sam's tricky
The plot thickens, onto page 3...

[Verse 3: Zev Love X]
Top of the mornin', sun's up, skies are blue
Once nothin...then cock-a-doodle-doo
All three knew this tool more than well
Sure beats alarm bells, they induce head swells
Well, clock says Sam's off to tend to his crop
Time says Farmer Tom's off to mop
Bo's up and at 'em, then twitches one eye
For something here is not quite cipher
""E-I-E-I-O!"" screamed Bo
""Left on my lawn, now it's gone, where's my ho?
O woe is me, how will I ever plant seeds
Lay the fertilizer, dig up the weeds?
Plus make true my foremost desire
To get a picket fence and trash the chicken wire?""
By, uh, 100% life gets hard
When one ho goes from one's garden

[Verse 4: Zev Love X]
Page 4: Little Bo weeped
Cleared tears from eyes then Little Bo peeped
Through a hole in Sam's six foot fence
Where Sam was seen plantin' tall and short pea plants
Hence the moral of the fable:
Always keep a boring book on your night table
A Tom is not able
But when you grow up to be a farmer keep an eye on your yard
Cuz with no ho it's hard",KMD,1963,"[69, 64, 55, 63, 78]",5
373,Antony And Cleopatra Theme,"Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend: From Ritual to Romance (Macmillan). Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean The Golden Bough; I have used especially the two volumes Adonis, Attis, Osiris. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognize in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.

46. I am not familiar with the exact constitution of the Tarot pack of cards, from which I have obviously departed to suit my own convenience. The Hanged Man, a member of the traditional pack, fits my purpose in two ways: because he is associated in my mind with the Hanged God of Frazer, and because I associate him with the hooded figure in the passage of the disciples to Emmaus in Part V. The Phoenician Sailor and the Merchant appear later; also the 'crowds of people', and Death by Water is executed in Part IV. The Man with Three Staves (an authentic member of the Tarot pack) I associate, quite arbitrarily, with the Fisher King himself.

210. The currants were quoted at a price 'carriage and insurance free to London'; and the Bill of Lading, etc., were to be handed to the buyer upon payment of the sight draft
218. Tiresias, although a mere spectator and not indeed a 'character', is yet the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest. Just as the one-eyed merchant, seller of currants, melts into the Phoenician Sailor, and the latter is not wholly distinct from Ferdinand Prince of Naples, so all the women are one woman, and the two sexes meet in Tiresias. What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem. The whole passage from Ovid is of great anthropological interest:
...Cum Iunone iocos et 'maior vestra profecto est
Quam, quae contingit maribus', dixisse, 'voluptas.'
Illa negat; placuit quae sit sententia docti
Quaerere Tiresiae: venus huic erat utraque nota
Nam duo magnorum viridi coeuntia silva
Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu
Deque viro factus, mirabile, femina septem
Egerat autumnos; octavo rursus eosdem
Vidit et 'est vestrae si tanta potentia plagae'
Dixit 'ut auctoris sortem in contraria mutet
Nunc quoque vos feriam!' percussis anguibus isdem
Forma prior rediit genetivaque venit imago
Arbiter hic igitur sumptus de lite iocosa
Dicta Iovis firmat; gravius Saturnia iusto
Nec pro materia fertur doluisse suique

At pater omnipotens (neque enim licet inrita cuiquam
Facta dei fecisse deo) pro lumine adempto

(The queen) was alone with Lord Robert and myself on the poop, when they began to talk nonsense, and went so far that Lord Robert at last said, as I was on the spot there was no reason why they should not be married if the queen pleased.
293. Cf. Purgatorio, V. 133:
'Ricorditi di me, che son la Pia;
Siena mi fe', disfecemi Maremma.'
307. V. St. Augustine's Confessions: 'to Carthage then I came, where a cauldron of unholy loves sang all about mine ears.'
308. The complete text of the Buddha's Fire Sermon (which corresponds in importance to the Sermon on the Mount) from which these words are taken, will be found translated in the late Henry Clarke Warren's Buddhism in Translation (Harvard Oriental Series). Mr. Warren was one of the great pioneers of Buddhist studies in the Occident.
309. From St. Augustine's Confessions again. The collocation of these two representatives of eastern and western asceticism, as the culmination of this part of the poem, is not an accident.

V. WHAT THE THUNDER SAID
In the first part of Part V three themes are employed: the journey to Emmaus, the approach to the Chapel Perilous (see Miss Weston's book), and the present decay of eastern Europe.
357. This is Turdus aonalaschkae pallasii, the hermit-thrush which I have heard in Quebec County. Chapman says (Handbook of Birds in Eastern North America) 'it is most at home in secluded woodland and thickety retreats.... Its notes are not remarkable for variety or volume, but in purity and sweetness of tone and exquisite modulation they are unequalled.' Its 'water-dripping song' is justly celebrated.
360. The following lines were stimulated by the account of one of the Antarctic expeditions (I forget which, but I think one of Shackleton's): it was related that the party of explorers, at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was one more member than could actually be counted.
367-77. Cf. Hermann Hesse, Blick ins Chaos:
Schon ist halb Europa, schon ist zumindest der halbe Osten Europas auf dem Wege zum Chaos, fährt betrunken im heiligen Wahn am Abgrund entlang und singt dazu, singt Betrunken und hymnisch wie Dmitri Karamasoff sang. Ueber diese Lieder lacht der Bürger Beleidigt, der Heilige und Seher hört sie mit Tränen.
401. 'Datta, dayadhvam, damyata' (Give, sympathize, control). The fable of the meaning of the Thunder is found in the Brihadaranyaka--Upanishad, 5, 1. A translation is found in Deussen's Sechzig Upanishads des Veda, p. 489.
407. Cf. Webster, The White Devil, V, vi:
...they'll remarry
Ere the worm pierce your winding-sheet, ere the spider
Make a thin curtain for your epitaphs
411. Cf. Inferno, xxxiii. 46:
Ed io sentii chiavar l'uscio di sotto
All'orribile torre
Also F. H. Bradley, Appearance and Reality, p. 346:
My external sensations are no less private to myself than are my thoughts or my feelings. In either case my experience falls within my own circle, a circle closed on the outside; and, with all its elements alike, every sphere is opaque to the others which surround it.... In brief, regarded as an existence which appears in a soul, the whole world for each is peculiar and private to that soul.
424. V. Weston, From Ritual to Romance; chapter on the Fisher King.
427. V. Purgatorio, xxvi. 148
'Ara vos prec per aquella valor
'que vos guida al som de l'escalina
'sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor.'
Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina
428. V. Pervigilium Veneris. Cf. Philomela in Parts II and III
429. V. Gerard de Nerval, Sonnet El Desdichado
431. V. Kyd's Spanish Tragedy
433. Shantih. Repeated as here, a formal ending to an Upanishad. 'The Peace which passeth understanding' is a feeble translation of the conduct of this word.",T.S. Eliot,1963,"[88, 83, 89, 93, 87]",5
374,I Can't Stop Loving You,"[Verse 1]
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday

[Verse 3]
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue

[Verse 4]
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did

God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen

380,String Along,"All my life I've waited for an angel
But no angel ever came along
Then one happy afternoon I met you
And my heart began to sing a song
Somehow, I mistook you for an angel
But now I'm glad that I was wrong

You may not be an angel
'Cause angels are so few
But until the day that one comes along
I'll string along with you

I'm looking for an angel
To sing my love song to
And until the day that one comes along
I'll sing my song to you

For every little fault that you have
Say, I've got three or four

(Buddy)
The human little faults that you do have
Just make me love you more

You may not be an angel
But still I'm sure you'll do

So until the day that one comes along

Lover, you've gone from me
And left behind so many memories

That you won from me at the state fair

Lover, you've gone from me

Here's our old favorite record

386,My Block,"[Verse 1]
They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
'Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit's scary, our black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm gettin' worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin' on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
'Cause all the little babies goin crazy and they sufferin' in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop 'cause it don't stop... on my block

[Richie Rich & 2Pac mini skit]

[Verse 2]
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male living in hell when will we prevail
Fearin' jail but crack sales got me livin' well
In a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin' strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starvin', can't get a job
So I resort to violent robbings, my life is hard
Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Misled from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block

[Richie Rich & 2Pac mini skit once again]

[Verse 3]
And I can't help but wonder why
So many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
'Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin' black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin' out pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor
Gamin' the hoochies hopin' I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin' strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin' phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin' focus... on my block

[Richie Rich & 2Pac skit once again]

[Verse 4]
And block parties in the projects lastin' way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin'
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, misses call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block

[Outro with Richie Rich vocals]
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I’m from

It came from Betty and was postmarked far away
I felt so good until I looked inside
I read that letter and I cried

She said, dear, Bobby
Just a line to say hello
We've been such good friends
You should be the first to know

I fell in love
My dreams have all come true
And, Bobby, he's so much like you

He swept me off my feet
I'd never thought I'd meet
Someone else who'd be so good to me

I know someday you'll find
Someone to love you true
You'll fall in love and then
You'll feel just like I do

So long for now
Write me soon, goodbye
I read that letter and I cried

I love her so
But now she'll never know
My golden chance has passed me by

I waited much too long
Now he's come along

This letter from Betty means goodbye

390,Summertime,"[Intro]
Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back 'cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your Jeep or your Benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on Lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hip you and to get you equipped for the summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

392,Birdland,"His father died and left him a little farm in New England
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
Cause when he looked up they started to slip
Then he put his head in the crux of his arms
And he started to...

Drift, drift to the belly of a ship
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board
And he was very different tonight
Cause he was not human
He was not human

Little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him, the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out...

“No, daddy, don't leave me here alone
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you are not human
You are not human.”
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm

Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said
“I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast
Take me up quick...

Take me up
To the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human.”

I am helium raven and this movie is mine
So he cried out as he stretched the sky
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them
And he put up his hands and he said, “It's me, it's me
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up
Don't leave me here!”
The son, the sign, the cross
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer

Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human
We're not human

Well, there was sand, there were tiles
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And then he saw raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up

I can't believe what I see
Tell me, who's that funky dude
Staring back at me?
Broken, beaten down (down), can't even get around
Without an old man cane, I fall and hit the ground
Shivering in the cold, I'm bitter and alone (woo!)

[Verse 2]
Excuse the bitching – I shouldn't complain
I should have no feeling, 'cause feeling is pain
As everything I need is denied me
And everything I want is taken away from me
But who do I got to blame?
Nobody but me

She left you last night
And today you called me on the phone
Asked me if you could come over
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
So you want me to stand in for her
And be the love of your next act
But this time I play the part so well
There'll be no need for her coming back, 'cause

You know that I'm your old stand-by
You know that you can call on me
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell
That she's left you in misery

I know you only called me 'cause you needed company
'Cause once again she's left you and your heart's in misery, but

You know that I'm your old stand-by
You know that you can call on me
I know the part so well that you can hardly tell
That she's left you in misery

I opened up the box to see what it said
I couldn't believe my eyes
When I had read
Though you belong to another I love you anyway
Yes eighteen yellow roses came today

I never doubted your love for a minute
I always thought that you would be true
But now this box and the flowers in it
I guess there's nothing left for me to do

And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs

Brought me the laughter and the tears

Mary, run, run, run
Jimmy, run, run, run
Mary, run, run, run

Mary and Jimmy were both very young
But as much in love
As two people could be
And all they wanted
Was to share that love eternally

They went to their folks they told them
That someday soon they'd be wed
Their folks just laughed
And called them kids
So Mary said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

They wouldn't have laughed at Mary
If they could have seen through the door
But Jimmy was waiting in the car
While Mary begged once more

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

Well as they drove off they were crying
And nobody knows for sure
That, that's why they didn't see the sign
That road detour

The next day they found them
Mary and Jimmy were dead
And as their folks
Knelt beside them in the rain
They couldn't help but hear
The last words that Mary and Jimmy had said

Give us your blessing
Please don't make us run away
Give us your blessing
Say you'll be there on our wedding day

And very often causes his downfall

Doing the things that will break his heart

An ugly woman cooks meals on time
She'll always give you peace of mind

So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Go ahead and marry anyway
Though her face is ugly her eyes don't match
Take it from me she's a better catch

Never make a pretty woman your wife
So for my personal point of view
Get an ugly girl to marry you
Get an ugly girl to marry you

Of a revolutionary Jay Guevera
Now it's a whole museum of, Hov MCers
Everybody dupin' the flow, you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like you tryin to make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and, Kan-yeezy
See how we adjusted the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like - oh shit, he's so handsome
Still in demand in the longest run standin
Kidnap rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back no rap
Young Hov's goin to Canton, I'm now eligible

Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count

For those that think Hov' fingers bling bling'n
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is, and single that out
To be the meaning of what he is about
And bein I'm about my business, not minglin' much
Runnin my mouth, that shit kept lingerin'
But no dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinklin'
The album width to keep the registers ringin'
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Jeah, you jinglin' baby
See I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot, but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
Oh, he's good, no he would never sell out, he's so hood

Point out the bounce, and show you how to get this dough in

Trapped in the past for too long

Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

[Verse 4]
I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road

431,I'm Saving My Love,"My love waits for you
There's nothing I can do
So I'm holding back
Afraid when I can't save it all
This love I know

I'm saving it, you've got to keep
I'm saving it, your love to me
A sentimental love tonight to me
Every time it is when you love somebody

No tears, no signs
Only makes it so much harder to go on
Just take good care
And remember when you're feeling all alone

You'll be with me in my heart
And always on my mind
The only thing that keeps us apart is time

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together
I'm saving my love for you

When we're, our two
And I felt that I've known you for so long
One thing, I knew
It was lovin' that would last on and on

Even with the best of plans
The world gets in the way
Don't be downhearted
I'll soon be back to stay

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

It's time for a promise
Never to be untrue
Until we're together

And I would be a fool to throw away my chances
The best shot that I ever had

And all that we could have
One of those romances
That's warmer with the good times
And grows stronger with the bad

Ooh Lord, I'm saving it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

When you love somebody
Who makes you feel so glad
When you need somebody
You need your love just as bad

Never to be untrue
Until we're together

Ooh baby, I'm saving it
Yes, that's all I wanna do, just save it

But one look in his eyes and you knew you were wrong
He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know
He could preach hot hell or freezing snow
He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black
He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king
Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing

Oh, nobody else can walk it for you
You've got to walk it by yourself

If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back
I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray
Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor
Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face
He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinking
It took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack
But that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black
He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again
And then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's been many years since we had to part
And I guess I learned his ways by heart
I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing
I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory
Because I want you to understand, the Reverend Mr. Black was my old man

If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all

I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all

So many good reviews off of Bastard
I celebrated, getting masturbated by my pastor
Now he's in a plastic, on the kitchen table
Near a bowl of Lucky Charms and the newest Thrasher

[Verse 1]
When I say Wolf Gang, you say fuck that
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious butt cracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
Um, that's not a potato, give me my gun back
Before I blast bigger than pimples on Big Pun's back
Black fat bitches was washin' on my dishes
And using my large stick on her lips like my cum's chapped
I love Jews but I hate faggots
And bitches who be nagging about me taking the trash out
I got a fuckin' can of whoop ass, who wants to pack it
Going ape shit in the newest bape straight jacket
With six dicks of chap stick, sticking in my black lips
Six sippie cups full of sick shit enhancements
Wolf Gang spit right
Ain't been this much fuckin' crack rock music since free way had flip side
So get low, lower than a ditch
I'm with some retarded bitch, hoping she know how to kiss low
They know, I'm the clinic's aid and I'm sick
So they clap for me kinda like a herpe on the lip
With some tutor bitch, tryna tickle wetback hooter this
Bitch acting I still did not know with it
Until I put this cock on, the end of clitoris
Fucking this game I used this shit as spit as lubricant
So who you with? (Umm, fuck)
I got this fuckin' gun, you better say yes you stupid bitch
Before you lose your wrist and rich make you do some dick
I'm fucking crazy, well I guess I am if these shoes will fit
Fuck the Key club, they wanna ban 'em
I got fucking fans from Compton to Montana
To Indiana, where deaf dwarfs still don't understand 'em
Because yelling at midgets is like me beefing with brandUn (Fuck him)
Stomp 'em out, with these crab ass Nikes
Make it look like some slob, scribbled all on his white Tee
Invite me, come on, you got a better chance to getting Shake
My dad and Earl's motherfuckin' momma to like me (Bitch)
Animals is farming you, patrick this is barnacles
Said he gave Ace a spongejob at the carnival
And Spongebob got his head knocked from the piss that Ace got
Nigga's soft as baby cock and the cotton swab

[Verse 2]
This that fuck music, put your shit and fuck to it
Shouldn't give one when your bumping in the trunk to it
Grab a couple gats, stuff 'em in your backpack and then take 'em to school
For show and tell day screamin' ""fuck students""
Locate the bitch that didn't wanna give you kiss
Then get her tits, then use your fists to add a couple lumps to it
Shoot the faculty for taking hats, you stupid butts
Skip the music teacher and the janitor you real cool with
Continue this procedure until lunch is through with
Go home out the back like a scared student
Keep a low pro, until you on your block
Then you just make it home in time for new news brief at 2ish
Stuck at all this bible study, shit is not fun
Me and wolf gang go jump nuns for hot fun
Playing with the bell when shots heard, and cops come
But I'm still punchin' this bitch out, I'm not done
Sittin' in my room masturbating
Truthful, these lyrics are relating like my dad did
I make music for teenagers and bad ass kids
Bastard touched more boys than your local church did

Me and Kid Sensation at home away from home
In the black Benz limo with the cellular phone
I'm calling up the posse it's time to get rippin
A freak in each sunroof to keep you suckas trippin
Everybody's looking if you're jealous turn around
The AMG kit keeps us closer to the ground
We're getting good grip from the 50 series tires
The Alpine's bumping but I need the volume higher
Cause the 808 kick drum makes the girlies get dumb
We're rolling Rainier and the jealous wanna get some
Every time we do this sucka mc's wanna battle
I'm the man they love to hate the J.R. Ewing of Seattle
Picked up the posse on 23rd and Jackson
Heading for the strip, yes we're looking for some action
The limo's kinda crowded, the whole car was leaning back
Maharaji's watching T.V. with two girlies on his lap
On Martin Luther King the set looks kinda dead
We need a new street so posse move ahead
We all look kinda swass, the crew you can't forget
The Mix-a-lot posse cold ripping up the set

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

[Verse 2]
Rollin in, my posse was getting kinda bored
There's not another posse with more points scored
We don't walk around like criminals or flex like big gorillas
My homeboy Kid Sensation is the teenage lady killa
Maharaji's on the def side dancing like a freak
The girlies see his booty and their knees get weak
Larry is the white guy people think he's funny
A real estate investor who makes a lot a money
Clocking lots a dollars, we all got gold
Cruising in this Benz and ain't got no place to go
Wheeling 23rd we saw nothing but thugs
The girlies was too skinny from smoking all them drugs
Cause the rock man got em and their butts just drop
The freaks look depressed because the Benz won't stop
At 23rd and Union the driver broke left
Kevin shouted Broadway it's time to get def
My girl blew me a kiss she said I was the best
She's looking mighty freaky in her black silk dress
The closer that we get, the crazier I feel
My posse's on Broadway, it's time to get ill

[Chorus]
My posse's on Broadway
My posse's on Broadway
Posse up

Cruising Broadway and my wheels spin slow
Rolling with your posse is the only way to go
The girlies by the college was looking for a ride
We tried to pick em up but we had no room inside
We put em on the trunk we put em on the hood
Some sat up with the driver they made him feel good
The posse's getting bigger, there's much too many freaks
My muffler is dragging, my suspension's getting weak
Now the freaks are getting hungry & Mix-a-Lot's treatin'
We stopped at Taco Bell for some Mexican eatin'
But Taco Bell was closed the girls was on my tip
They said, ""Go back the other way we'll stop and eat at Dick's""
Dick's is the place were the cool hang out
The swass like to play and the rich flaunt clout
Posse to the burger stand so big we walk in twos
We're getting dirty looks from those other sucker crews
Kid Sensation dropped a 20 and didn't even miss it
Skeezer from another crew, she picked it up and kissed it
Her boyfriend's illin, he went to slap her face
My homeboy PLB cold sprayed the boy with mace
Cause I never liked a punk who beat up on his girl
If you don't have game then let her leave your world
We took his girl with us
With him she rode the bus
She gave the boy the finger and the sucker starts to cuss
Boy I got a def posse you got a bunch a dudes
You're broke cold crying about the rock man blues

To learn what I need to know, and oh

And I still wish that she belonged to me
I don't know how I ever could thought that
I'd let her go and still be just the same
Well I found out my world turned all around her
And every where I go I hear her name
Somewhere along the way I don't know why
I thought that I would want to let her go
But now whenever I see her with you I
Realize how much I didn't know

And if you tell her everything she could be

Look, I ain't gon' lie, was tryin' to find feelin's
'Cause lately I have been feelin' numb
It's not fair to you, you deserve the one
Stop tellin' me I'm the perfect one
'Cause perfect is perception
Perception is all that they can see
Saw people turned fake like make-believe
Never gonna find fake in me
Know I don't ever give a fuck if they hate you
They probably hate themselves too
A couple girls want to date you
Couple years ago I was see-through
You would never make it from the same shoes
Never gave me credit when I payed dues
Need a couple beats I put the pain to
A couple years ago, I was mean too
That's back when I could barely pay rent
Savin' water bottles just to make cents
Spill my soul each and every night
On a couple beats that Dan Haynes sent
Was waitin' tables and a waitress told me
That my stupid dreams never made sense
Had a 9 to 5, couple people hatin'
And they still sittin' at the same desk

I know, I know I got this shit
Don't fuck with lames who wanna be me

[Verse 2]
I know, I know, I deserve better
We were held together by four letters
Took a couple L's, ended up in hell
Thought the love was real, shoulda known better
Had to bounce back
Invest all the money my account had
While rappers rap about a round ass, I'ma fuck the game
And take the crown back, that's a sound fact
Here's a soundtrack for everyone who doubted
And even me, I even thought about it
Your fake love, I could do without it
Every fuckin' stage, I leave the people shoutin'
And I'm the people's champ, I'm the new Rock
This is new rap, this is new pop
This is new rock, I fit no genre
The one and only, the new Mantra
Fuck commas, no, I'm never stoppin'
Still underrated, started from the bottom
Only see me fall if it was fuckin' autumn
Got a lotta followers, too bad you bought 'em
I'm a fuckin' problem, I just say it twice
I'm a fuckin' problem through the pain I write
Talk to myself when I need great advice
Stars shine the brightest in the darkest nights, now

How you gon' fuck with me now?
Funny how everything changed
Now they in love with the sound
Don't give a fuck what they say
You should come see me on tour
Had to cut ties from the fake
You cannot play me no more
Maybe I should get high
Need somethin' to balance the lows
Somethin' to deal with the pain
Someone to call on my phone
I'm in love with the truth
Did this all on our own
Only real will remain
Maybe that's all I know

And your mind goes...

And the laugh from the crow that watches you
Is louder than it's ever been
And the room you never left
Has a heavenly view of a spiraling abyss

A moment of peace for the fractured son
If you feel the heat in the morning
From a sun you can hardly see
Don't worry, little bird
The dead walk among us
Not punished or rewarded

Say hello to the black sunrise
It's brighter than it's ever been

Mi sono innamorato di una chica loca
La classica bambina con cui non si gioca
Mi avevano avvertito e sono stato idiota
Con quel vestito bianco mi sembrava innocua

Quando vorrei dormire all'alba delle sei
Linda mi tiene sveglio, niente buenas noches
Dovrei lasciarla, porta solo guai
Ma ne sono schiavo, penso solo a noi
Quando il fine settimana ci uniamo tutta la mañana
Ci uniamo tutta la mañana
Sognando di scappare prima o poi
Di partire per non ritornare mai e lasciarci tutti dietro
Hasta luego!

Come ogni uomo immerso nei pensieri suoi
Non parlo molto ma più sto con te più hablo
Con te neanche del diablo tengo miedo

Give, you make me feel a way I never felt with no one else
And I can't help myself

I'm telling you that no matter how far I go

502,The Folk Singer,"He use to sing his songs to his Sara Jane
The folk singer
His songs filled with love made the mountains ring
To the folk singer
At first Sara Jane was to be his bride
But as his fame grew she was pushed aside
So the mountain girl would say good-bye
To the folk singer
He let his hair grow long and he dressed in style
The folk singer
His voice was pure and the fans went wild
For the folk singer
He said Sara Jane was much too plain
So he left her alone as grew more fame
But sorrow will come like a mountain rain
To the folk singer
Lavished in glory, fortune at his feet
The folk singer
Awoke one morning and he couldn't speak
The folk singer
The doctor said his singing days were through
Thousands wept, Sara Jane did too
He could not sing now his friends were few
The folk singer
Sick at heart in the mountains again
The folk singer
Now Sara Jane didn't look so plain
To the folk singer
Oh the power of love can do strange things
Cause love has made him sing again
Only now he sings for his Sara Jane
The folk singer
And once again the mountains ring
To the folk singer

505,South Street,"Stayed up late, we tried to dream ourselves away
We've been growing up with grace
Been wondering if I should stay
Well if you say so

Heaven knows she's not quite who she hoped she'd be
And heaven knows I disagree
She's not in time and don't misspeak
You wild and worldly boy

So keep your front door closed
Keep your ears to the ground, keep your eyes in the open road
Don't go
And since I can't forget
I want to breathe out your lungs and cast a whole new silhouette
I want to

The sky could fall tonight for all I care
On South Street, I won't be there

After night, I met you at the station side
Slightly drunk but quite contrite
I'm wired to the moon tonight
I'm going nowhere

Faster now, headlong through the side street
Make Christmas lights come on for me
Make me believe the make believe

So keep your front door closed
Keep your ears to the ground, keep your eyes in the open road
Don't go
And since I can't forget
I want to breathe out your lungs and cast a whole new silhouette
I want to

The sky could fall tonight for all I care
On South Street, I won't be there

Song Ends with the poem, ""Bright Is the Ring . . . ""
""Bright is the ring of words
When the right man rings them
Fair the fall of songs
When the singer sings them
Still they are carolled and said --
On wings they are carried --
After the singer is dead
And the maker buried

Low as the singer lies
In the field of heather
Songs of his fashion bring
The swains together
And when the west is red
With the sunset embers
The lover lingers and sings
And the maid remembers.""

Now would you take me back when I gamble my pay
I've got no direction without her little fingers
Barbed wire razor wire nothing keeps me from her

Hmm-mm

[Hook 1: Bugzy Malone]
Yeah
Today is gonna be the day
That they throw it all back to you
And by now
You should have somehow realised what you have to do
The world keeps on turning round
Bridges keep burning down
Nobody can hear you now
No matter how loud you shout

[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]
Sitting in total silence
Totally lost, no guidance
'Dey don't call no more, nobody can find ya'
Nobody can find the time like they lost their watch
They find it hard to think you went soft
They find an architect that I've promised that I make sure
He puts the building blocks in place
Start rebuilding, we've been broken since children
They keep telling me that we're only human
I don't do no silly excuses
Nobody wins, we're losing
So violent and abusive
It's all battle, scars and bruises
'Cause what really-

[Hook 2: Tom Grennan]
The sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see
That angel's eyes, they bleed
This life, I chose
My open wounds they show that
Memory lane is like a winding road

[Hook 1: Bugzy Malone]
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

[Bridge: Bugzy Malone]
I just want you to know that I love you
It's a cruel world outside but I need you to know that I got you
Such a forgetful place and I don't want them to forget you
Hard times have arrived and I wanna make sure that we get through

[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]
I look into your eyes sometimes
All I can see is emptiness, no resemblance, no more fire
Or anything similar
When did the winter get to us
I'll go blind, looking at a light so bright?
But if I can find my way
Then I'll come back for you and I'll make it right
I wanna say something but I don't know how
I gotta keep it moving, I can't turn 'round
How did David make Goliath fall down?
What's the king if the king has lost its crown?

[Pre-Hook: Tom Grennan]
But today is our day
We ain't running away
But the night was so long that
Today is the day that we break off our chains?

When the sun shines down on me, on me, on me
And breaks my ties, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see

Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess
You drove a Jeep Cherokee but no money for gas

You tried to downplay your beauty but you couldn't fool me
You tried to play like you're tough but you grew up by the beach
Said you hated the world but somehow you liked me
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long
Coulda looked at you all night long, all night long

How can I forget you in the morning?
How can I forget you?
I was dreaming you were standing there wearing my t-shirt
Wishing that you could still be here
How can I forget? I can't, I can't
How can I forget? I can't, I can't

Ran ten blocks in the rain, girl
Train ain't running this late, girl
You the only one to do me like that
Why you biting on your lip like that? (Don't stop)
Falling through that doorway, stopping this ain't no way

Danced barefoot and your hair was a mess

As people get drunk upstairs on the deck

520,Out Of My Mind,"[Strofa 1]
Odio la gente da sempre
Come odio quel modo in cui mente per niente
Odio quel vuoto che rendono oro
Quel modo che c'hanno di credere al niente
Odio le mode di merda, le code di gente, le folle, la fila
Le facce che ridono sotto la metro
Poi sogno che esplodano come Hiroshima
Sangue, Jack e china, sopra ogni mia rima è vale tudo
Chiudimi in gabbie di carta
E spacco la faccia a tutto quello che ho vissuto
L'esperienza è come argilla, passano anche i guai
Quello che resta ce l'hai nelle mani
Poi conta che forma gli dai
Quanti ne ho avuti di guai
Quanta ne ho trasformata di merda, sai?
Tanto più il resto cadeva più in basso
Io tanto più alzavo il volume all'hi-fi
Vai, oh, oh! Cazzo ne sai? Odio il tuo cazzo di flow
Come trattate l'hip hop, come trattate la musica
Come se fosse uno show
Ho piene le palle da un po'
Piene le mani di schiaffi vediamo a chi è che le do
Facce di cazzo cambiate qualcosa
O chiudete quei cazzo di blog
Frà sono pazzo, lo so, troppe ce ne ho
Tu sei cattolico o no?
Amo il mio prossimo come me stesso
È per questo che vi odio da un po'
Ciao bro'!

[Ritornello]
Qua nessuno sa in quale posto va
Vivono e non sanno, sono morti già
Mando a fanculo tutto, fuck my fucking rhymes
I'm running out of my mind!

[Strofa 2]
Odio le forze dell'ordine fino a che l'ordine è piramidale
Quindi ogni infame che è al soldo dell'ordine
Difende l'ordine e non l'ordinare
Odio le banche, le pare, credo sia cosa ordinale
Credo che possa cambiare
Sogno di farti pagare ogni tuo capitale
Di meglio che può capitare?
Il nuovo schiavismo non è carnale, non fisico
È solidamente mentale
Solitamente non pago coi soldi degli altri
Ma ogni altro lo continua a fare
""Economia coloniale"", chiedi alla banca centrale
Normale che quando le leggi le fanno gli ingiusti
Ogni loro ingiustizia diventi legale
Dice: ""È normale bro', ammettilo che avresti fatto lo stesso
Che un avido resta un avido
E un tossico resta fatto lo stesso""
Che il bene è più falso del male
Che almeno è di un falso reale
Mezzo è di un pazzo geniale
Che gira in Ferrari il progresso
E a piedi va l'evoluzione mentale
Tutto è così occidentale che nasce da serio e diventa banale
Così complesso e radiale che o torni allo zero
O continui e continuerai male
Bro', fare l'hardcore non è essere snob, non è essere un flop
È sentire il sangue che scorre di vero
Ogni cazzo di giorno che c'ho
Mudblood!

Waiting on the sidelines drooling, some need schooling
Let me teach yo and roll a student what

I'd be lyin' if I said I wouldn't come runnin' when you called
I'd be lyin' if I said that I wouldn't drop it all
Fuck them other niggas, you know I put you before them all
I'm the one that's been down through it all
I'm the one that picks you up when you fall
I'm the one who held it down with no pride
When shit got hard, so tell me what it is, what the fuck goin' on?
Like tell me what it is boy, tell me what it ain't
Tell me how you feel boy, tell me what you think
Tell me is it real boy, tell me is it fake
Is it really what you want or you just playin' games like
'Cause shit not addin' up
You steady tellin' me you love me but you actin' up
And every time we move forward it's like you backin' up
And we done been through this all, ain't that bad enough like
What I didn't text you enough? (no)
What I wasn't sexy enough? (no)
What I didn't sext you enough?
Didn't call not enough? was my love not enough? like
Damn, tell me how you feel
You got me over here, in my

[Chorus]
You got me in my feelings (you got me)
You got me in my feelings (you got me)
You got me (baby you got me)
You got me (baby you got me)
You got me in my feelings

[Outro]
You got me in my feelings, what am I to do?
Tell me do I leave or do I stick with you?
Stick with you, I'm so confused, baby I'm confused
Tell me do I leave or do I stick with you?
Stick with you, what do I do, tell me what do I do
Baby do I leave or...",Ann Marie,1963,"[86, 88, 90]",3

Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?

I must have been blind

Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

[Thee Tom Hardy - V1]
Let’s blaze, what a way to escape
What’s a way for you to waste away your days of mistakes?
Eyes glossy, glazed-over like, donuts and cakes
You’re happy with somebody so you wish and hope that it’s fate
But what if it’s fake? Hell of a scam, the whole time
All for the pie, you know, key lime
If it all ended today, at least you tried
It was a nice ride, time to go inside
Yourself and take a look at the person and how it’s hurtin’
Like how could somebody love you for years and then desert ya
What’s the whole purpose? Experience of learning?
Exterior is strong but inside you’re certainly burning
Take two of these that’s the remedy for anything
You could be happy or else, at least pretend to be
Own biggest enemy, killing self slow
They tell you hold on loose but never let go

[Tunji - V2]
Yo
I still remember the first time I realized that life wasn’t picture perfect
My father packing up his things to leave his kids deserted
The rain reflecting off the windows as it hit the surface
I wonder if he thinks the shit was worth it
As I sit here and write another one
Puffin on another blunt
Zonin til’ my buzz is done
Proud to be my mother’s son
See, she taught me to always be calm and pensive
And live my life without ever regrettin mistakes and consequences
My strongest lessons as a young fella
You see I’ve done hella runnin through the rain with no umbrella
But no complainin it just forced us to become better
Wintertime – one sweater
Dinnertime – crumbs fed us
I sit and think about the wisdom that I’ve gained
Reminiscin as I listen to the rhythm of the rain
I’m driven and persistent with my vision and my aim
If I did it all again I would live this all the same

[Kno - V3]
Yo, uh
I’m storm chasing
And she’s an F-5 with a sex drive that’ll leave me tied to her bedside
Hurricane hips, stoppin all progression
Serotonin levels drop, tropical depression
She is my professor and I’ve been taught a lesson
That in the eye of the storm the pressures barometric
She knows I’m wary of her game plan
But when she gambles she can count on me
I’m her Rain Man
Damn shame man, the fly stewardess
Mental turbulence, head off in the cumulus
Blaming the weather or whatever for her moodiness
My main star but I’m barely on her radar
And so my heart sinks – or the pain floats
I’m in a shit storm, shoulda wore a raincoat
The clouds break and I can tell its over
Cause she’s my sunshine but I’m catching melanoma

Standin' all alone lookin' sad and shy
We began to dance, swaying' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let him go

Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands

Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention

I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)

Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""

Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body

If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight

(Now we got that out the way)",Jussie Smollett,1963,"[73, 93, 98]",3
538,Hot Cakes! 1st Serving,"        It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.

        We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of men, as I have lived to see practised since. But such things as these were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded abroad, and from them was handed about by word of mouth only; so that things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now. But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off again, and people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in, and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection. This they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died of the plague. Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk, and he also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of mortality in the usual manner, thus—

Plague, 2. Parishes infected, 1.

        The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all over the town, and the more, because in the last week in December 1664 another man died in the same house, and of the same distemper. And then we were easy again for about six weeks, when none having died with any marks of infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that, I think it was about the 12th of February, another died in another house, but in the same parish and in the same manner.

        This turned the people's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town, and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles's parish more than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the people at that end of the town, and that many had died of it, though they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public as possible. This possessed the heads of the people very much, and few cared to go through Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected, unless they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it

        This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a week, in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St Andrew's, Holborn, were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more or less; but from the time that the plague first began in St Giles's parish, it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number considerably. For example:—

From December 27 to January 3 { St Giles's 16
""                                                { St Andrew's 17

""       January 3      ""        ""      10 { St Giles's 12
""                                                { St Andrew's 25

""       January 10     ""        ""      17 { St Giles's 18
""                                                { St Andrew's 28

"" January 17 "" "" 24 { St Giles's 23
""                                                { St Andrew's 16

"" January 24 "" "" 31 { St Giles's 24
""                                                { St Andrew's 15

"" January 30 "" February 7 { St Giles's 21
""                                                { St Andrew's 23

"" February 7 "" "" 14 { St Giles's 24

        The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St Bride's, adjoining on one side of Holborn parish, and in the parish of St James, Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in both which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six or eight, whereas at that time they were increased as follows:—

From December 20 to December 27 { St Bride's 0
""                                               { St James's 8

"" December 27 to January 3 { St Bride's 6
""                                               { St James's 9

"" January 3 "" "" 10 { St Bride's 11
""                                               { St James's 7

"" January 10 "" "" 17 { St Bride's 12
""                                                { St James's 9

"" January 17 "" "" 24 { St Bride's 9
""                                               { St James's 15

"" January 24 "" "" 31 { St Bride's 8
""                                               { St James's 12

"" January 31 "" February 7 { St Bride's 13
""                                               { St James's 5

"" February 7 "" "" 14 { St Bride's 12

        Besides this, it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks, although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very moderate.

        The usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was from about 240 or thereabouts to 300. The last was esteemed a pretty high bill; but after this we found the bills successively increasing as follows:—

Buried. Increased.
December the 20th to the 27th                      291                ...
""         ""         27th        ""   3rd January           349                58

        This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had been known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of 1656.

        However, all this went off again, and the weather proving cold, and the frost, which began in December, still continuing very severe even till near the end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the bills decreased again, and the city grew healthy, and everybody began to look upon the danger as good as over; only that still the burials in St Giles's continued high. From the beginning of April especially they stood at twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th, when there was buried in St Giles's parish thirty, whereof two of the plague and eight of the spotted-fever, which was looked upon as the same thing; likewise the number that died of the spotted-fever in the whole increased, being eight the week before, and twelve the week above-named.

        This alarmed us all again, and terrible apprehensions were among the people, especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and the summer being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some hopes again; the bills were low, the number of the dead in all was but 388, there was none of the plague, and but four of the spotted-fever.

        But the following week it returned again, and the distemper was spread into two or three other parishes, viz., St Andrew's, Holborn; St Clement Danes; and, to the great affliction of the city, one died within the walls, in the parish of St Mary Woolchurch, that is to say, in Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks Market; in all there were nine of the plague and six of the spotted-fever. It was, however, upon inquiry found that this Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who, having lived in Long Acre, near the infected houses, had removed for fear of the distemper, not knowing that he was already infected.

        This was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable, and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged them was that the city was healthy: the whole ninety-seven parishes buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope that, as it was chiefly among the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and the rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the 16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or liberties; and St Andrew's buried but fifteen, which was very low. 'Tis true St Giles's buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it was but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every way, and that many died of it every day. So that now all our extenuations abated, and it was no more to be concealed; nay, it quickly appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of abatement. That in the parish of St Giles it was gotten into several streets, and several families lay all sick together; and, accordingly, in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself. There was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague, but this was all knavery and collusion, for in St Giles's parish they buried forty in all, whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague, though they were set down of other distempers; and though the number of all the burials were not increased above thirty-two, and the whole bill being but 385, yet there was fourteen of the spotted-fever, as well as fourteen of the plague; and we took it for granted upon the whole that there were fifty died that week of the plague.

        The next bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the number of the plague was seventeen. But the burials in St Giles's were fifty-three—a frightful number!—of whom they set down but nine of the plague; but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace, and at the Lord Mayor's request, it was found there were twenty more who were really dead of the plague in that parish, but had been set down of the spotted-fever or other distempers, besides others concealed.

        But those were trifling things to what followed immediately after; for now the weather set in hot, and from the first week in June the infection spread in a dreadful manner, and the bills rose high; the articles of the fever, spotted-fever, and teeth began to swell; for all that could conceal their distempers did it, to prevent their neighbours shunning and refusing to converse with them, and also to prevent authority shutting up their houses; which, though it was not yet practised, yet was threatened, and people were extremely terrified at the thoughts of it.

        The second week in June, the parish of St Giles, where still the weight of the infection lay, buried 120, whereof though the bills said but sixty-eight of the plague, everybody said there had been 100 at least, calculating it from the usual number of funerals in that parish, as above.

        Till this week the city continued free, there having never any died, except that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before, within the whole ninety-seven parishes. Now there died four within the city, one in Wood Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark was entirely free, having not one yet died on that side of the water.

        I lived without Aldgate, about midway between Aldgate Church and Whitechappel Bars, on the left hand or north side of the street; and as the distemper had not reached to that side of the city, our neighbourhood continued very easy. But at the other end of the town their consternation was very great: and the richer sort of people, especially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city, thronged out of town with their families and servants in an unusual manner; and this was more particularly seen in Whitechappel; that is to say, the Broad Street where I lived; indeed, nothing was to be seen but waggons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, &c.; coaches filled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them, and all hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, and spare horses with servants, who, it was apparent, were returning or sent from the countries to fetch more people; besides innumerable numbers of men on horseback, some alone, others with servants, and, generally speaking, all loaded with baggage and fitted out for travelling, as anyone might perceive by their appearance.

        This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it was a sight which I could not but look on from morning to night (for indeed there was nothing else of moment to be seen), it filled me with very serious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy condition of those that would be left in it.

        This hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no getting at the Lord Mayor's door without exceeding difficulty; there were such pressing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of health for such as travelled abroad, for without these there was no being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road, or to lodge in any inn. Now, as there had none died in the city for all this time, my Lord Mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all those who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the liberties too for a while.

        This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the month of May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that an order of the Government was to be issued out to place turnpikes and barriers on the road to prevent people travelling, and that the towns on the road would not suffer people from London to pass for fear of bringing the infection along with them, though neither of these rumours had any foundation but in the imagination, especially at-first.

        I now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case, and how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether I should resolve to stay in London or shut up my house and flee, as many of my neighbours did. I have set this particular down so fully, because I know not but it may be of moment to those who come after me, if they come to be brought to the same distress, and to the same manner of making their choice; and therefore I desire this account may pass with them rather for a direction to themselves to act by than a history of my actings, seeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to note what became of me.

        I had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on my business and shop, which was considerable, and in which was embarked all my effects in the world; and the other was the preservation of my life in so dismal a calamity as I saw apparently was coming upon the whole city, and which, however great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as other people's, represented to be much greater than it could be.

        The first consideration was of great moment to me; my trade was a saddler, and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade, but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so my effects lay very much in the hands of such. I was a single man, 'tis true, but I had a family of servants whom I kept at my business; had a house, shop, and warehouses filled with goods; and, in short, to leave them all as things in such a case must be left (that is to say, without any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them), had been to hazard the loss not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all I had in the world.

        I had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many years before come over from Portugal: and advising with him, his answer was in three words, the same that was given in another case quite different, viz., 'Master, save thyself.' In a word, he was for my retiring into the country, as he resolved to do himself with his family; telling me what he had, it seems, heard abroad, that the best preparation for the plague was to run away from it. As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods, or debts, he quite confuted me. He told me the same thing which I argued for my staying, viz., that I would trust God with my safety and health, was the strongest repulse to my pretensions of losing my trade and my goods; 'for', says he, 'is it not as reasonable that you should trust God with the chance or risk of losing your trade, as that you should stay in so eminent a point of danger, and trust Him with your life?'

        I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to go, having several friends and relations in Northamptonshire, whence our family first came from; and particularly, I had an only sister in Lincolnshire, very willing to receive and entertain me.

        My brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into Bedfordshire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very earnestly; and I had once resolved to comply with his desires, but at that time could get no horse; for though it is true all the people did not go out of the city of London, yet I may venture to say that in a manner all the horses did; for there was hardly a horse to be bought or hired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I resolved to travel on foot with one servant, and, as many did, lie at no inn, but carry a soldier's tent with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being very warm, and no danger from taking cold. I say, as many did, because several did so at last, especially those who had been in the armies in the war which had not been many years past; and I must needs say that, speaking of second causes, had most of the people that travelled done so, the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and houses as it was, to the great damage, and indeed to the ruin, of abundance of people.

        But then my servant, whom I had intended to take down with me, deceived me; and being frighted at the increase of the distemper, and not knowing when I should go, he took other measures, and left me, so I was put off for that time; and, one way or other, I always found that to appoint to go away was always crossed by some accident or other, so as to disappoint and put it off again; and this brings in a story which otherwise might be thought a needless digression, viz., about these disappointments being from Heaven.

        I mention this story also as the best method I can advise any person to take in such a case, especially if he be one that makes conscience of his duty, and would be directed what to do in it, namely, that he should keep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time, and look upon them complexly, as they regard one another, and as all together regard the question before him: and then, I think, he may safely take them for intimations from Heaven of what is his unquestioned duty to do in such a case; I mean as to going away from or staying in the place where we dwell, when visited with an infectious distemper.

        It came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on this particular thing, that as nothing attended us without the direction or permission of Divine Power, so these disappointments must have something in them extraordinary; and I ought to consider whether it did not evidently point out, or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven I should not go. It immediately followed in my thoughts, that if it really was from God that I should stay, He was able effectually to preserve me in the midst of all the death and danger that would surround me; and that if I attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my habitation, and acted contrary to these intimations, which I believe to be Divine, it was a kind of flying from God, and that He could cause His justice to overtake me when and where He thought fit.

        These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, and when I came to discourse with my brother again I told him that I inclined to stay and take my lot in that station in which God had placed me, and that it seemed to be made more especially my duty, on the account of what I have said.

        My brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I had suggested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told me several stories of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I was; that I ought indeed to submit to it as a work of Heaven if I had been any way disabled by distempers or diseases, and that then not being able to go, I ought to acquiesce in the direction of Him, who, having been my Maker, had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then there had been no difficulty to determine which was the call of His providence and which was not; but that I should take it as an intimation from Heaven that I should not go out of town, only because I could not hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away that was to attend me, was ridiculous, since at the time I had my health and limbs, and other servants, and might with ease travel a day or two on foot, and having a good certificate of being in perfect health, might either hire a horse or take post on the road, as I thought fit.

        Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which attended the presumption of the Turks and Mahometans in Asia and in other places where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, was a few years before, as I have already observed, returned from abroad, coming last from Lisbon), and how, presuming upon their professed predestinating notions, and of every man's end being predetermined and unalterably beforehand decreed, they would go unconcerned into infected places and converse with infected persons, by which means they died at the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the Europeans or Christian merchants, who kept themselves retired and reserved, generally escaped the contagion.

        Upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and I began to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready; for, in short, the infection increased round me, and the bills were risen to almost seven hundred a week, and my brother told me he would venture to stay no longer. I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next day, and I would resolve: and as I had already prepared everything as well as I could as to MY business, and whom to entrust my affairs with, I had little to do but to resolve.

        I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind, irresolute, and not knowing what to do. I had set the evening wholly—apart to consider seriously about it, and was all alone; for already people had, as it were by a general consent, taken up the custom of not going out of doors after sunset; the reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by-and-by.

        In the retirement of this evening I endeavoured to resolve, first, what was my duty to do, and I stated the arguments with which my brother had pressed me to go into the country, and I set, against them the strong impressions which I had on my mind for staying; the visible call I seemed to have from the particular circumstance of my calling, and the care due from me for the preservation of my effects, which were, as I might say, my estate; also the intimations which I thought I had from Heaven, that to me signified a kind of direction to venture; and it occurred to me that if I had what I might call a direction to stay, I ought to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved if I obeyed.

        This lay close to me, and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to stay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that I should be kept. Add to this, that, turning over the Bible which lay before me, and while my thoughts were more than ordinarily serious upon the question, I cried out, 'Well, I know not what to do; Lord, direct me I' and the like; and at that juncture I happened to stop turning over the book at the gist Psalm, and casting my eye on the second verse, I read on to the seventh verse exclusive, and after that included the tenth, as follows: 'I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling,' &C.

        I scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved that I would stay in the town, and casting myself entirely upon the goodness and protection of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter whatever; and that, as my times were in His hands, He was as able to keep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health; and if He did not think fit to deliver me, still I was in His hands, and it was meet He should do with me as should seem good to Him.

        With this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed in it the next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had intended to entrust my house and all my affairs. But I had a further obligation laid on me on the same side, for the next day I found myself very much out of order also, so that if I would have gone away, I could not, and I continued ill three or four days, and this entirely determined my stay; so I took my leave of my brother, who went away to Dorking, in Surrey, and afterwards fetched a round farther into Buckinghamshire or Bedfordshire, to a retreat he had found out there for his family.

        It was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one complained, it was immediately said he had the plague; and though I had indeed no symptom of that distemper, yet being very ill, both in my head and in my stomach, I was not without apprehension that I really was infected; but in about three days I grew better; the third night I rested well, sweated a little, and was much refreshed. The apprehensions of its being the infection went also quite away with my illness, and I went about my business as usual.

        These things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the country; and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate either with him or with myself on that subject.

        It was now mid-July, and the plague, which had chiefly raged at the other end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes of St Giles, St Andrew's, Holborn, and towards Westminster, began to now come eastward towards the part where I lived. It was to be observed, indeed, that it did not come straight on towards us; for the city, that is to say, within the walls, was indifferently healthy still; nor was it got then very much over the water into Southwark; for though there died that week 1268 of all distempers, whereof it might be supposed above 600 died of the plague, yet there was but twenty-eight in the whole city, within the walls, and but nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish included; whereas in the parishes of St Giles and St Martin-in-the-Fields alone there died 421.

        But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out-parishes, which being very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more to prey upon than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We perceived, I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes of Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two parishes joining to Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney, the infection came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts, even when it abated at the western parishes where it began.

        It was very strange to observe that in this particular week, from the 4th to the 11th of July, when, as I have observed, there died near 400 of the plague in the two parishes of St Martin and St Giles-in-the-Fields only, there died in the parish of Aldgate but four, in the parish of Whitechappel three, in the parish of Stepney but one.

        Likewise in the next week, from the 11th of July to the 18th, when the week's bill was 1761, yet there died no more of the plague, on the whole Southwark side of the water, than sixteen. But this face of things soon changed, and it began to thicken in Cripplegate parish especially, and in Clarkenwell; so that by the second week in August, Cripplegate parish alone buried 886, and Clarkenwell 155. Of the first, 850 might well be reckoned to die of the plague; and of the last, the bill itself said 145 were of the plague.

        During the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part of the town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I went ordinarily about the streets, as my business required, and particularly went generally once in a day, or in two days, into the city, to my brother's house, which he had given me charge of, and to see if it was safe; and having the key in my pocket, I used to go into the house, and over most of the rooms, to see that all was well; for though it be something wonderful to tell, that any should have hearts so hardened in the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal, yet certain it is that all sorts of villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were then practised in the town as openly as ever—I will not say quite as frequently, because the numbers of people were many ways lessened.

        But the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within the walls; but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by so great a multitude having been gone into the country; and even all this month of July they continued to flee, though not in such multitudes as formerly. In August, indeed, they fled in such a manner that I began to think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in the city.

        As they fled now out of the city, so I should observe that the Court removed early, viz., in the month of June, and went to Oxford, where it pleased God to preserve them; and the distemper did not, as I heard of, so much as touch them, for which I cannot say that I ever saw they showed any great token of thankfulness, and hardly anything of reformation, though they did not want being told that their crying vices might without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing that terrible judgement upon the whole nation.

        The face of London was—now indeed strangely altered: I mean the whole mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and altogether; for as to the particular part called the city, or within the walls, that was not yet much infected. But in the whole the face of things, I say, was much altered; sorrow and sadness sat upon every face; and though some parts were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply concerned; and, as we saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked on himself and his family as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to represent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and give the reader due ideas of the horror 'that everywhere presented itself, it must make just impressions upon their minds and fill them with surprise. London might well be said to be all in tears; the mourners did not go about the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made a formal dress of mourning for their nearest friends; but the voice of mourners was truly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houses, where their dearest relations were perhaps dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed the streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the world to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost in every house, especially in the first part of the visitation; for towards the latter end men's hearts were hardened, and death was so always before their eyes, that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of their friends, expecting that themselves should be summoned the next hour.

        Business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even when the sickness was chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me, as well as to everybody else, it was a most surprising thing to see those streets which were usually so thronged now grown desolate, and so few people to be seen in them, that if I had been a stranger and at a loss for my way, I might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street (I mean of the by-streets), and seen nobody to direct me except watchmen set at the doors of such houses as were shut up, of which I shall speak presently.

        One day, being at that part of the town on some special business, curiosity led me to observe things more than usually, and indeed I walked a great way where I had no business. I went up Holborn, and there the street was full of people, but they walked in the middle of the great street, neither on one side or other, because, as I suppose, they would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses, or meet with smells and scent from houses that might be infected.

        The Inns of Court were all shut up; nor were very many of the lawyers in the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn, to be seen there. Everybody was at peace; there was no occasion for lawyers; besides, it being in the time of the vacation too, they were generally gone into the country. Whole rows of houses in some places were shut close up, the inhabitants all fled, and only a watchman or two left.

        When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut up by the magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed the Court, by the necessity of their employments and other dependences; and as others retired, really frighted with the distemper, it was a mere desolating of some of the streets. But the fright was not yet near so great in the city, abstractly so called, and particularly because, though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation, yet as I have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first, so they were, as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several times, till it began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared violent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or the east and south parts, the people began to take courage, and to be, as I may say, a little hardened. It is true a vast many people fled, as I have observed, yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town, and from that we call the heart of the city: that is to say, among the wealthiest of the people, and such people as were unencumbered with trades and business. But of the rest, the generality stayed, and seemed to abide the worst; so that in the place we calf the Liberties, and in the suburbs, in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping, Ratcliff, Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally stayed, except here and there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did not depend upon their business.

        It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously full of people at the time of this visitation, I mean at the time that it began; for though I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty throngs of people settling in London more than ever, yet we had always a notion that the numbers of people which, the wars being over, the armies disbanded, and the royal family and the monarchy being restored, had flocked to London to settle in business, or to depend upon and attend the Court for rewards of services, preferments, and the like, was such that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand people more than ever it held before; nay, some took upon them to say it had twice as many, because all the ruined families of the royal party flocked hither. All the old soldiers set up trades here, and abundance of families settled here. Again, the Court brought with them a great flux of pride, and new fashions. All people were grown gay and luxurious, and the joy of the Restoration had brought a vast many families to London.

        I often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when the Jews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover—by which means an incredible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise have been in other countries—so the plague entered London when an incredible increase of people had happened occasionally, by the particular circumstances above-named. As this conflux of the people to a youthful and gay Court made a great trade in the city, especially in everything that belonged to fashion and finery, so it drew by consequence a great number of workmen, manufacturers, and the like, being mostly poor people who depended upon their labour. And I remember in particular that in a representation to my Lord Mayor of the condition of the poor, it was estimated that there were no less than an hundred thousand riband-weavers in and about the city, the chiefest number of whom lived then in the parishes of Shoreditch, Stepney, Whitechappel, and Bishopsgate, that, namely, about Spitalfields; that is to say, as Spitalfields was then, for it was not so large as now by one fifth part.

        By this, however, the number of people in the whole may be judged of; and, indeed, I often wondered that, after the prodigious numbers of people that went away at first, there was yet so great a multitude left as it appeared there was.

        But I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time. While the fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by several odd accidents which, put altogether, it was really a wonder the whole body of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their dwellings, leaving the place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for an Akeldama, doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and that all that would be found in it would perish with it. I shall name but a few of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many wizards and cunning people propagating them, that I have often wondered there was any (women especially) left behind.

        In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several months before the plague, as there did the year after another, a little before the fire. The old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the other sex, whom I could almost call old women too, remarked (especially afterward, though not till both those judgements were over) that those two comets passed directly over the city, and that so very near the houses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to the city alone; that the comet before the pestilence was of a faint, dull, languid colour, and its motion very heavy, Solemn, and slow; but that the comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as others said, flaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that, accordingly, one foretold a heavy judgement, slow but severe, terrible and frightful, as was the plague; but the other foretold a stroke, sudden, swift, and fiery as the conflagration. Nay, so particular some people were, that as they looked upon that comet preceding the fire, they fancied that they not only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and could perceive the motion with their eye, but even they heard it; that it made a rushing, mighty noise, fierce and terrible, though at a distance, and but just perceivable.

        I saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had so much of the common notion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look upon them as the forerunners and warnings of God's judgements; and especially when, after the plague had followed the first, I yet saw another of the like kind, I could not but say God had not yet sufficiently scourged the city.

        But I could not at the same time carry these things to the height that others did, knowing, too, that natural causes are assigned by the astronomers for such things, and that their motions and even their revolutions are calculated, or pretended to be calculated, so that they cannot be so perfectly called the forerunners or foretellers, much less the procurers, of such events as pestilence, war, fire, and the like.

        But let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be, or have been, what they will, these things had a more than ordinary influence upon the minds of the common people, and they had almost universal melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful calamity and judgement coming upon the city; and this principally from the sight of this comet, and the little alarm that was given in December by two people dying at St Giles's, as above.

        The apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the error of the times; in which, I think, the people, from what principle I cannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies and astrological conjurations, dreams, and old wives' tales than ever they were before or since. Whether this unhappy temper was originally raised by the follies of some people who got money by it—that is to say, by printing predictions and prognostications—I know not; but certain it is, books frighted them terribly, such as Lilly's Almanack, Gadbury's Astrological Predictions, Poor Robin's Almanack, and the like; also several pretended religious books, one entitled, Come out of her, my People, lest you be Partaker of her Plagues; another called, Fair Warning; another, Britain's Remembrancer; and many such, all, or most part of which, foretold, directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay, some were so enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with their oral predictions, pretending they were sent to preach to the city; and one in particular, who, like Jonah to Nineveh, cried in the streets, 'Yet forty days, and London shall be destroyed.' I will not be positive whether he said yet forty days or yet a few days. Another ran about naked, except a pair of drawers about his waist, crying day and night, like a man that Josephus mentions, who cried, 'Woe to Jerusalem!' a little before the destruction of that city. So this poor naked creature cried, 'Oh, the great and the dreadful God!' and said no more, but repeated those words continually, with a voice and countenance full of horror, a swift pace; and nobody could ever find him to stop or rest, or take any sustenance, at least that ever I could hear of. I met this poor creature several times in the streets, and would have spoken to him, but he would not enter into speech with me or any one else, but held on his dismal cries continually.

        These things terrified the people to the last degree, and especially when two or three times, as I have mentioned already, they found one or two in the bills dead of the plague at St Giles's.

        Next to these public things were the dreams of old women, or, I should say, the interpretation of old women upon other people's dreams; and these put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices warning them to be gone, for that there would be such a plague in London, so that the living would not be able to bury the dead. Others saw apparitions in the air; and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope without breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and saw sights that never appeared; but the imagination of the people was really turned wayward and possessed. And no wonder, if they who were poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations and appearances, which had nothing in them but air, and vapour. Here they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming out of a cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city; there they saw hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried; and there again, heaps of dead bodies lying unburied, and the like, just as the imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to work upon. So hypochondriac fancies represent Ships, armies, battles in the firmament; Till steady eyes the exhalations solve, And all to its first matter, cloud, resolve.

        I could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave every day of what they had seen; and every one was so positive of their having seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting them without breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and unmannerly on the one hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other. One time before the plague was begun (otherwise than as I have said in St Giles's), I think it was in March, seeing a crowd of people in the street, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all staring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to her, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described every part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and the form, and the poor people came into it so eagerly, and with so much readiness; 'Yes, I see it all plainly,' says one; 'there's the sword as plain as can be.' Another saw the angel. One saw his very face, and cried out what a glorious creature he was! One saw one thing, and one another. I looked as earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much willingness to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see nothing but a white cloud, bright on one side by the shining of the sun upon the other part. The woman endeavoured to show it me, but could not make me confess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must have lied. But the woman, turning upon me, looked in my face, and fancied I laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for I really did not laugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor people were terrified by the force of their own imagination. However, she turned from me, called me profane fellow, and a scoffer; told me that it was a time of God's anger, and dreadful judgements were approaching, and that despisers such as I should wander and perish.

        The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she; and I found there was no persuading them that I did not laugh at them, and that I should be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them. So I left them; and this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself.

        Another encounter I had in the open day also; and this was in going through a narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate Churchyard, by a row of alms-houses. There are two churchyards to Bishopsgate church or parish; one we go over to pass from the place called Petty France into Bishopsgate Street, coming out just by the church door; the other is on the side of the narrow passage where the alms-houses are on the left; and a dwarf-wall with a palisado on it on the right hand, and the city wall on the other side more to the right.

        In this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the palisadoes into the burying-place, and as many people as the narrowness of the passage would admit to stop, without hindering the passage of others, and he was talking mightily eagerly to them, and pointing now to one place, then to another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a gravestone there. He described the shape, the posture, and the movement of it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of amazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as he. On a sudden he would cry, 'There it is; now it comes this way.' Then, 'Tis turned back'; till at length he persuaded the people into so firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another fancied he saw it; and thus he came every day making a strange hubbub, considering it was in so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, and then the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were called away, disappeared on a sudden.

        I looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this man directed, but could not see the least appearance of anything; but so positive was this poor man, that he gave the people the vapours in abundance, and sent them away trembling and frighted, till at length few people that knew of it cared to go through that passage, and hardly anybody by night on any account whatever.

        This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses, and to the ground, and to the people, plainly intimating, or else they so understanding it, that abundance of the people should come to be buried in that churchyard, as indeed happened; but that he saw such aspects I must acknowledge I never believed, nor could I see anything of it myself, though I looked most earnestly to see it, if possible.

        These things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with delusions; and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation, all their predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague, which should lay the whole city, and even the kingdom, waste, and should destroy almost all the nation, both man and beast.

        To this, as I said before, the astrologers added stories of the conjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous influence, one of which conjunctions was to happen, and did happen, in October, and the other in November; and they filled the people's heads with predictions on these signs of the heavens, intimating that those conjunctions foretold drought, famine, and pestilence. In the two first of them, however, they were entirely mistaken, for we had no droughty season, but in the beginning of the year a hard frost, which lasted from December almost to March, and after that moderate weather, rather warm than hot, with refreshing winds, and, in short, very seasonable weather, and also several very great rains.

        Some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as terrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them, some of whom were taken up; but nothing was done in it, as I am informed, the Government being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may say, all out of their wits already.

        Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sank than lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them no doubt did it for the strengthening the resolution of the people, and especially for quickening them to repentance, but it certainly answered not their end, at least not in proportion to the injury it did another way; and indeed, as God Himself through the whole Scriptures rather draws to Him by invitations and calls to turn to Him and live, than drives us by terror and amazement, so I must confess I thought the ministers should have done also, imitating our blessed Lord and Master in this, that His whole Gospel is full of declarations from heaven of God's mercy, and His readiness to receive penitents and forgive them, complaining, 'Ye will not come unto Me that ye may have life', and that therefore His Gospel is called the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel of Grace.

        But we had some good men, and that of all persuasions and opinions, whose discourses were full of terror, who spoke nothing but dismal things; and as they brought the people together with a kind of horror, sent them away in tears, prophesying nothing but evil tidings, terrifying the people with the apprehensions of being utterly destroyed, not guiding them, at least not enough, to cry to heaven for mercy.

        It was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches among us in matters of religion. Innumerable sects and divisions and separate opinions prevailed among the people. The Church of England was restored, indeed, with the restoration of the monarchy, about four years before; but the ministers and preachers of the Presbyterians and Independents, and of all the other sorts of professions, had begun to gather separate societies and erect altar against altar, and all those had their meetings for worship apart, as they have now, but not so many then, the Dissenters being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are since; and those congregations which were thus gathered together were yet but few. And even those that were, the Government did not allow, but endeavoured to suppress them and shut up their meetings.

        But the visitation reconciled them again, at least for a time, and many of the best and most valuable ministers and preachers of the Dissenters were suffered to go into the churches where the incumbents were fled away, as many were, not being able to stand it; and the people flocked without distinction to hear them preach, not much inquiring who or what opinion they were of. But after the sickness was over, that spirit of charity abated; and every church being again supplied with their own ministers, or others presented where the minister was dead, things returned to their old channel again.

        One mischief always introduces another. These terrors and apprehensions of the people led them into a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things, which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them to: and this was running about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and astrologers to know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to have their fortunes told them, their nativities calculated, and the like; and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked generation of pretenders to magic, to the black art, as they called it, and I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse dealings with the devil than they were really guilty of. And this trade grew so open and so generally practised that it became common to have signs and inscriptions set up at doors: 'Here lives a fortune-teller', 'Here lives an astrologer', 'Here you may have your nativity calculated', and the like; and Friar Bacon's brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these people's dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the sign of Mother Shipton, or of Merlin's head, and the like.

        With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil pleased and satisfied the people I really know not, but certain it is that innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day. And if but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band, and a black coat, which was the habit those quack-conjurers generally went in, was but seen in the streets the people would follow them in crowds, and ask them questions as they went along.

        I need not mention what a horrid delusion this was, or what it tended to; but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself put an end to it all—and, I suppose, cleared the town of most of those calculators themselves. One mischief was, that if the poor people asked these mock astrologers whether there would be a plague or no, they all agreed in general to answer 'Yes', for that kept up their trade. And had the people not been kept in a fright about that, the wizards would presently have been rendered useless, and their craft had been at an end. But they always talked to them of such-and-such influences of the stars, of the conjunctions of such-and-such planets, which must necessarily bring sickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. And some had the assurance to tell them the plague was begun already, which was too true, though they that said so knew nothing of the matter.

        The ministers, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts that were serious and understanding persons, thundered against these and other wicked practices, and exposed the folly as well as the wickedness of them together, and the most sober and judicious people despised and abhorred them. But it was impossible to make any impression upon the middling people and the working labouring poor. Their fears were predominant over all their passions, and they threw away their money in a most distracted manner upon those whimsies. Maid-servants especially, and men-servants, were the chief of their customers, and their question generally was, after the first demand of 'Will there be a plague?' I say, the next question was, 'Oh, sir I for the Lord's sake, what will become of me? Will my mistress keep me, or will she turn me off? Will she stay here, or will she go into the country? And if she goes into the country, will she take me with her, or leave me here to be starved and undone?' And the like of menservants.

        The truth is, the case of poor servants was very dismal, as I shall have occasion to mention again by-and-by, for it was apparent a prodigious number of them would be turned away, and it was so. And of them abundance perished, and particularly of those that these false prophets had flattered with hopes that they should be continued in their services, and carried with their masters and mistresses into the country; and had not public charity provided for these poor creatures, whose number was exceeding great and in all cases of this nature must be so, they would have been in the worst condition of any people in the city.

        These things agitated the minds of the common people for many months, while the first apprehensions were upon them, and while the plague was not, as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not forget that the more serious part of the inhabitants behaved after another manner. The Government encouraged their devotion, and appointed public prayers and days of fasting and humiliation, to make public confession of sin and implore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgement which hung over their heads; and it is not to be expressed with what alacrity the people of all persuasions embraced the occasion; how they flocked to the churches and meetings, and they were all so thronged that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very doors of the largest churches. Also there were daily prayers appointed morning and evening at several churches, and days of private praying at other places; at all which the people attended, I say, with an uncommon devotion. Several private families also, as well of one opinion as of another, kept family fasts, to which they admitted their near relations only. So that, in a word, those people who were really serious and religious applied themselves in a truly Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and humiliation, as a Christian people ought to do.

        Again, the public showed that they would bear their share in these things; the very Court, which was then gay and luxurious, put on a face of just concern for the public danger. All the plays and interludes which, after the manner of the French Court, had been set up, and began to increase among us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, public dancing-rooms, and music-houses, which multiplied and began to debauch the manners of the people, were shut up and suppressed; and the jack-puddings, merry-andrews, puppet-shows, rope-dancers, and such-like doings, which had bewitched the poor common people, shut up their shops, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were agitated with other things, and a kind of sadness and horror at these things sat upon the countenances even of the common people. Death was before their eyes, and everybody began to think of their graves, not of mirth and diversions.

        But even those wholesome reflections—which, rightly managed, would have most happily led the people to fall upon their knees, make confession of their sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour for pardon, imploring His compassion on them in such a time of their distress, by which we might have been as a second Nineveh—had a quite contrary extreme in the common people, who, ignorant and stupid in their reflections as they were brutishly wicked and thoughtless before, were now led by their fright to extremes of folly; and, as I have said before, that they ran to conjurers and witches, and all sorts of deceivers, to know what should become of them (who fed their fears, and kept them always alarmed and awake on purpose to delude them and pick their pockets), so they were as mad upon their running after quacks and mountebanks, and every practising old woman, for medicines and remedies; storing themselves with such multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as they were called, that they not only spent their money but even poisoned themselves beforehand for fear of the poison of the infection; and prepared their bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against it. On the other hand it is incredible and scarce to be imagined, how the posts of houses and corners of streets were plastered over with doctors' bills and papers of ignorant fellows, quacking and tampering in physic, and inviting the people to come to them for remedies, which was generally set off with such flourishes as these, viz.: 'Infallible preventive pills against the plague.' 'Neverfailing preservatives against the infection.' 'Sovereign cordials against the corruption of the air.' 'Exact regulations for the conduct of the body in case of an infection.' 'Anti-pestilential pills.' 'Incomparable drink against the plague, never found out before.' 'An universal remedy for the plague.' 'The only true plague water.' 'The royal antidote against all kinds of infection';—and such a number more that I cannot reckon up; and if I could, would fill a book of themselves to set them down.

        Others set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for directions and advice in the case of infection. These had specious titles also, such as these:—

        'An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland, where he resided during all the time of the great plague last year in Amsterdam, and cured multitudes of people that actually had the plague upon them.'

        'An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a choice secret to prevent infection, which she found out by her great experience, and did wonderful cures with it in the late plague there, wherein there died 20,000 in one day.'

        'An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with great success in the late plague in this city, anno 1636, gives her advice only to the female sex. To be spoken with,' &c.

        'An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of antidotes against all sorts of poison and infection, has, after forty years' practice, arrived to such skill as may, with God's blessing, direct persons how to prevent their being touched by any contagious distemper whatsoever. He directs the poor gratis.'

        I take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two or three dozen of the like and yet have abundance left behind. 'Tis sufficient from these to apprise any one of the humour of those times, and how a set of thieves and pickpockets not only robbed and cheated the poor people of their money, but poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal preparations; some with mercury, and some with other things as bad, perfectly remote from the thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than serviceable to the body in case an infection followed.

        I cannot omit a subtility of one of those quack operators, with which he gulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did nothing for them without money. He had, it seems, added to his bills, which he gave about the streets, this advertisement in capital letters, viz., 'He gives advice to the poor for nothing.'

        Abundance of poor people came to him accordingly, to whom he made a great many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their health and of the constitution of their bodies, and told them many good things for them to do, which were of no great moment. But the issue and conclusion of all was, that he had a preparation which if they took such a quantity of every morning, he would pawn his life they should never have the plague; no, though they lived in the house with people that were infected. This made the people all resolve to have it; but then the price of that was so much, I think 'twas half-a-crown. 'But, sir,' says one poor woman, 'I am a poor almswoman and am kept by the parish, and your bills say you give the poor your help for nothing.' 'Ay, good woman,' says the doctor, 'so I do, as I published there. I give my advice to the poor for nothing, but not my physic.' 'Alas, sir!' says she, 'that is a snare laid for the poor, then; for you give them advice for nothing; that is to say, you advise them gratis, to buy your physic for their money; so does every shop-keeper with his wares.' Here the woman began to give him ill words, and stood at his door all that day, telling her tale to all the people that came, till the doctor finding she turned away his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again, and give her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good for nothing when she had it.

        But to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be imposed upon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank. There is no doubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great gains out of the miserable people, for we daily found the crowds that ran after them were infinitely greater, and their doors were more thronged than those of Dr Brooks, Dr Upton, Dr Hodges, Dr Berwick, or any, though the most famous men of the time. And I was told that some of them got five pounds a day by their physic.

        But there was still another madness beyond all this, which may serve to give an idea of the distracted humour of the poor people at that time: and this was their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of these; for these petty thieves only deluded them to pick their pockets and get their money, in which their wickedness, whatever it was, lay chiefly on the side of the deceivers, not upon the deceived. But in this part I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in the people deceived, or equally in both; and this was in wearing charms, philtres, exorcisms, amulets, and I know not what preparations, to fortify the body with them against the plague; as if the plague was not the hand of God, but a kind of possession of an evil spirit, and that it was to be kept off with crossings, signs of the zodiac, papers tied up with so many knots, and certain words or figures written on them, as particularly the word Abracadabra, formed in triangle or pyramid, thus:—

ABRACADABRA
ABRACADABR        Others had the Jesuits'
ABRACADAB                mark in a cross:
ABRACADA                        I H
ABRACAD                           S.
ABRACA
ABRAC                      Others nothing but this
ABRA                                mark, thus:
ABR
AB                                        * *
A                                          {*}
        I might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the follies, and indeed the wickedness, of those things, in a time of such danger, in a matter of such consequences as this, of a national infection. But my memorandums of these things relate rather to take notice only of the fact, and mention only that it was so. How the poor people found the insufficiency of those things, and how many of them were afterwards carried away in the dead-carts and thrown into the common graves of every parish with these hellish charms and trumpery hanging about their necks, remains to be spoken of as we go along.

        All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after the first notion of the plaque being at hand was among them, and which may be said to be from about Michaelmas 1664, but more particularly after the two men died in St Giles's in the beginning of December; and again, after another alarm in February. For when the plague evidently spread itself, they soon began to see the folly of trusting to those unperforming creatures who had gulled them of their money; and then their fears worked another way, namely, to amazement and stupidity, not knowing what course to take or what to do either to help or relieve themselves. But they ran about from one neighbour's house to another, and even in the streets from one door to another, with repeated cries of, 'Lord, have mercy upon us! What shall we do?'

        Indeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing in which they had little or no relief, and which I desire to mention with a serious awe and reflection, which perhaps every one that reads this may not relish; namely, that whereas death now began not, as we may say, to hover over every one's head only, but to look into their houses and chambers and stare in their faces. Though there might be some stupidity and dulness of the mind (and there was so, a great deal), yet there was a great deal of just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul, if I may so say, of others. Many consciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confession was made of crimes long concealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian to have heard the dying groans of many a despairing creature, and none durst come near to comfort them. Many a robbery, many a murder, was then confessed aloud, and nobody surviving to record the accounts of it. People might be heard, even into the streets as we passed along, calling upon God for mercy through Jesus Christ, and saying, 'I have been a thief, 'I have been an adulterer', 'I have been a murderer', and the like, and none durst stop to make the least inquiry into such things or to administer comfort to the poor creatures that in the anguish both of soul and body thus cried out. Some of the ministers did visit the sick at first and for a little while, but it was not to be done. It would have been present death to have gone into some houses. The very buriers of the dead, who were the hardenedest creatures in town, were sometimes beaten back and so terrified that they durst not go into houses where the whole families were swept away together, and where the circumstances were more particularly horrible, as some were; but this was, indeed, at the first heat of the distemper.

        Time inured them to it all, and they ventured everywhere afterwards without hesitation, as I shall have occasion to mention at large hereafter.

        I am supposing now the plague to be begun, as I have said, and that the magistrates began to take the condition of the people into their serious consideration. What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and of infected families, I shall speak to by itself; but as to the affair of health, it is proper to mention it here that, having seen the foolish humour of the people in running after quacks and mountebanks, wizards and fortune-tellers, which they did as above, even to madness, the Lord Mayor, a very sober and religious gentleman, appointed physicians and surgeons for relief of the poor—I mean the diseased poor and in particular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions for cheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances of the distemper. This, indeed, was one of the most charitable and judicious things that could be done at that time, for this drove the people from haunting the doors of every disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly and without consideration poison for physic and death instead of life.

        This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole College; and, as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor and for cheap medicines, it was made public, so that everybody might see it, and copies were given gratis to all that desired it. But as it is public, and to be seen on all occasions, I need not give the reader of this the trouble of it.

        I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the physicians when I say that the violence of the distemper, when it came to its extremity, was like the fire the next year. The fire, which consumed what the plague could not touch, defied all the application of remedies; the fire-engines were broken, the buckets thrown away, and the power of man was baffled and brought to an end. So the Plague defied all medicines; the very physicians were seized with it, with their preservatives in their mouths; and men went about prescribing to others and telling them what to do till the tokens were upon them, and they dropped down dead, destroyed by that very enemy they directed others to oppose. This was the case of several physicians, even some of them the most eminent, and of several of the most skilful surgeons. Abundance of quacks too died, who had the folly to trust to their own medicines, which they must needs be conscious to themselves were good for nothing, and who rather ought, like other sorts of thieves, to have run away, sensible of their guilt, from the justice that they could not but expect should punish them as they knew they had deserved.

        Not that it is any derogation from the labour or application of the physicians to say they fell in the common calamity; nor is it so intended by me; it rather is to their praise that they ventured their lives so far as even to lose them in the service of mankind. They endeavoured to do good, and to save the lives of others. But we were not to expect that the physicians could stop God's judgements, or prevent a distemper eminently armed from heaven from executing the errand it was sent about.

        Doubtless, the physicians assisted many by their skill, and by their prudence and applications, to the saving of their lives and restoring their health. But it is not lessening their character or their skill, to say they could not cure those that had the tokens upon them, or those who were mortally infected before the physicians were sent for, as was frequently the case.

        It remains to mention now what public measures were taken by the magistrates for the general safety, and to prevent the spreading of the distemper, when it first broke out. I shall have frequent occasion to speak of the prudence of the magistrates, their charity, their vigilance for the poor, and for preserving good order, furnishing provisions, and the like, when the plague was increased, as it afterwards was. But I am now upon the order and regulations they published for the government of infected families.

        I mentioned above shutting of houses up; and it is needful to say something particularly to that, for this part of the history of the plague is very melancholy, but the most grievous story must be told.

        About June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen, as I have said, began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation of the city.

        The justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction of the Secretary of State, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields, St Martin, St Clement Danes, &c., and it was with good success; for in several streets where the plague broke out, upon strict guarding the houses that were infected, and taking care to bury those that died immediately after they were known to be dead, the plague ceased in those streets. It was also observed that the plague decreased sooner in those parishes after they had been visited to the full than it did in the parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechappel, Stepney, and others; the early care taken in that manner being a great means to the putting a check to it.

        This shutting up of houses was a method first taken, as I understand, in the plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King James the First to the crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own houses was granted by Act of Parliament, entitled, 'An Act for the charitable Relief and Ordering of Persons infected with the Plague'; on which Act of Parliament the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded the order they made at this time, and which took place the 1st of July 1665, when the numbers infected within the city were but few, the last bill for the ninety-two parishes being but four; and some houses having been shut up in the city, and some people being removed to the pest-house beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to Islington,—I say, by these means, when there died near one thousand a week in the whole, the number in the city was but twenty-eight, and the city was preserved more healthy in proportion than any other place all the time of the infection.

        These orders of my Lord Mayor's were published, as I have said, the latter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and were as follows, viz.:—

        ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE CITY OF LONDON CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE, 1665.

        'WHEREAS in the reign of our late Sovereign King James, of happy memory, an Act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of persons infected with the plague, whereby authority was given to justices of the peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head-officers to appoint within their several limits examiners, searchers, watchmen, keepers, and buriers for the persons and places infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the performance of their offices. And the same statute did also authorise the giving of other directions, as unto them for the present necessity should seem good in their directions. It is now, upon special consideration, thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding of infection of sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God) that these officers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter duly observed.

        Examiners to be appointed in every Parish.

        'First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every parish there be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit chosen and appointed by the alderman, his deputy, and common council of every ward, by the name of examiners, to continue in that office the space of two months at least. And if any fit person so appointed shall refuse to undertake the same, the said parties so refusing to be committed to prison until they shall conform themselves accordingly.

        The Examiner's Office.

        'That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn from time to time what houses in every parish be visited, and what persons be sick, and of what diseases, as near as they can inform themselves; and upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of access until it appear what the disease shall prove. And if they find any person sick of the infection, to give order to the constable that the house be shut up; and if the constable shall be found remiss or negligent, to give present notice thereof to the alderman of the ward.

        Watchmen.

        'That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen, one for every day, and the other for the night; and that these watchmen have a special care that no person go in or out of such infected houses whereof they have the charge, upon pain of severe punishment. And the said watchmen to do such further offices as the sick house shall need and require: and if the watchman be sent upon any business, to lock up the house and take the key with him; and the watchman by day to attend until ten of the clock at night, and the watchman by night until six in the morning.

        Searchers.

        'That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every parish, such as are of honest reputation, and of the best sort as can be got in this kind; and these to be sworn to make due search and true report to the utmost of their knowledge whether the persons whose bodies they are appointed to search do die of the infection, or of what other diseases, as near as they can. And that the physicians who shall be appointed for cure and prevention of the infection do call before them the said searchers who are, or shall be, appointed for the several parishes under their respective cares, to the end they may consider whether they are fitly qualified for that employment, and charge them from time to time as they shall see cause, if they appear defective in their duties.

        'That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use any public work or employment, or keep any shop or stall, or be employed as a laundress, or in any other common employment whatsoever.

        Chirurgeons.

        'For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there hath been heretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the further spreading of the infection, it is therefore ordered that there be chosen and appointed able and discreet chirurgeons, besides those that do already belong to the pest-house, amongst whom the city and Liberties to be quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient; and every of these to have one quarter for his limit; and the said chirurgeons in every of their limits to join with the searchers for the view of the body, to the end there may be a true report made of the disease.

        'And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such-like persons as shall either send for them or be named and directed unto them by the examiners of every parish, and inform themselves of the disease of the said parties.

        'And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all other cures, and kept only to this disease of the infection, it is ordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall have twelve-pence a body searched by them, to be paid out of the goods of the party searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the parish.

        Nurse-keepers.

        'If any nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house before twenty-eight days after the decease of any person dying of the infection, the house to which the said nurse-keeper doth so remove herself shall be shut up until the said twenty-eight days be expired.'

        ORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE.

        Notice to be given of the Sickness.

        'The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house complaineth, either of blotch or purple, or swelling in any part of his body, or falleth otherwise dangerously sick, without apparent cause of some other disease, shall give knowledge thereof to the examiner of health within two hours after the said sign shall appear.

        Sequestration of the Sick.

        'As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon, or searcher to be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be sequestered in the same house; and in case he be so sequestered, then though he afterwards die not, the house wherein he sickened should be shut up for a month, after the use of the due preservatives taken by the rest.

        Airing the Stuff.

        'For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their bedding and apparel and hangings of chambers must be well aired with fire and such perfumes as are requisite within the infected house before they be taken again to use. This to be done by the appointment of an examiner.

        Shutting up of the House.

        'If any person shall have visited any man known to be infected of the plague, or entered willingly into any known infected house, being not allowed, the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for certain days by the examiner's direction.

        None to be removed out of infected Houses, but, &C.

        'Item, that none be removed out of the house where he falleth sick of the infection into any other house in the city (except it be to the pest-house or a tent, or unto some such house which the owner of the said visited house holdeth in his own hands and occupieth by his own servants); and so as security be given to the parish whither such remove is made, that the attendance and charge about the said visited persons shall be observed and charged in all the particularities before expressed, without any cost of that parish to which any such remove shall happen to be made, and this remove to be done by night. And it shall be lawful to any person that hath two houses to remove either his sound or his infected people to his spare house at his choice, so as, if he send away first his sound, he not after send thither his sick, nor again unto the sick the sound; and that the same which he sendeth be for one week at the least shut up and secluded from company, for fear of some infection at the first not appearing.

        Burial of the Dead.

        'That the burial of the dead by this visitation be at most convenient hours, always either before sun-rising or after sun-setting, with the privity of the churchwardens or constable, and not otherwise; and that no neighbours nor friends be suffered to accompany the corpse to church, or to enter the house visited, upon pain of having his house shut up or be imprisoned.

        'And that no corpse dying of infection shall be buried, or remain in any church in time of common prayer, sermon, or lecture. And that no children be suffered at time of burial of any corpse in any church, churchyard, or burying-place to come near the corpse, coffin, or grave. And that all the graves shall be at least six feet deep.

        'And further, all public assemblies at other burials are to be foreborne during the continuance of this visitation.

        No infected Stuff to be uttered.

        'That no clothes, stuff, bedding, or garments be suffered to be carried or conveyed out of any infected houses, and that the criers and carriers abroad of bedding or old apparel to be sold or pawned be utterly prohibited and restrained, and no brokers of bedding or old apparel be permitted to make any outward show, or hang forth on their stalls, shop-boards, or windows, towards any street, lane, common way, or passage, any old bedding or apparel to be sold, upon pain of imprisonment. And if any broker or other person shall buy any bedding, apparel, or other stuff out of any infected house within two months after the infection hath been there, his house shall be shut up as infected, and so shall continue shut up twenty days at the least.

        No Person to be conveyed out of any infected House.

        'If any person visited do fortune, by negligent looking unto, or by any other means, to come or be conveyed from a place infected to any other place, the parish from whence such party hath come or been conveyed, upon notice thereof given, shall at their charge cause the said party so visited and escaped to be carried and brought back again by night, and the parties in this case offending to be punished at the direction of the alderman of the ward, and the house of the receiver of such visited person to be shut up for twenty days.

        Every visited House to be marked.

        'That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot long in the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual printed words, that is to say, ""Lord, have mercy upon us,"" to be set close over the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the same house.

        Every visited House to be watched.

        'That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended with watchmen, which may keep them in, and minister necessaries unto them at their own charges, if they be able, or at the common charge, if they are unable; the shutting up to be for the space of four weeks after all be whole.

        'That precise order to be taken that the searchers, chirurgeons, keepers, and buriers are not to pass the streets without holding a red rod or wand of three feet in length in their hands, open and evident to be seen, and are not to go into any other house than into their own, or into that whereunto they are directed or sent for; but to forbear and abstain from company, especially when they have been lately used in any such business or attendance.

        Inmates.

        'That where several inmates are in one and the same house, and any person in that house happens to be infected, no other person or family of such house shall be suffered to remove him or themselves without a certificate from the examiners of health of that parish; or in default thereof, the house whither he or they so remove shall be shut up as in case of visitation.

        Hackney-Coaches.

        'That care be taken of hackney-coachmen, that they may not (as some of them have been observed to do after carrying of infected persons to the pest-house and other places) be admitted to common use till their coaches be well aired, and have stood unemployed by the space of five or six days after such service.'

        ORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT.

        The Streets to be kept Clean.

        'First, it is thought necessary, and so ordered, that every householder do cause the street to be daily prepared before his door, and so to keep it clean swept all the week long.

        That Rakers take it from out the Houses.

        'That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by the rakers, and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by the blowing of a horn, as hitherto hath been done.

        Laystalls to be made far off from the City.

        'That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city and common passages, and that no nightman or other be suffered to empty a vault into any garden near about the city.

        Care to be had of unwholesome Fish or Flesh, and of musty Corn.

        'That special care be taken that no stinking fish, or unwholesome flesh, or musty corn, or other corrupt fruits of what sort soever, be suffered to be sold about the city, or any part of the same.

        'That the brewers and tippling-houses be looked into for musty and unwholesome casks.

        'That no hogs, dogs, or cats, or tame pigeons, or ponies, be suffered to be kept within any part of the city, or any swine to be or stray in the streets or lanes, but that such swine be impounded by the beadle or any other officer, and the owner punished according to Act of Common Council, and that the dogs be killed by the dog-killers appointed for that purpose.'

        ORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES.

        Beggars.

        'Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of rogues and wandering beggars that swarm in every place about the city, being a great cause of the spreading of the infection, and will not be avoided, notwithstanding any orders that have been given to the contrary: It is therefore now ordered, that such constables, and others whom this matter may any way concern, take special care that no wandering beggars be suffered in the streets of this city in any fashion or manner whatsoever, upon the penalty provided by the law, to be duly and severely executed upon them.

        Plays.

        'That all plays, bear-baitings, games, singing of ballads, buckler-play, or such-like causes of assemblies of people be utterly prohibited, and the parties offending severely punished by every alderman in his ward.

        Feasting prohibited.

        'That all public feasting, and particularly by the companies of this city, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places of common entertainment, be forborne till further order and allowance; and that the money thereby spared be preserved and employed for the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the infection.

        Tippling-houses.

        'That disorderly tippling in taverns, ale-houses, coffee-houses, and cellars be severely looked unto, as the common sin of this time and greatest occasion of dispersing the plague. And that no company or person be suffered to remain or come into any tavern, ale-house, or coffee-house to drink after nine of the clock in the evening, according to the ancient law and custom of this city, upon the penalties ordained in that behalf.

        'And for the better execution of these orders, and such other rules and directions as, upon further consideration, shall be found needful: It is ordered and enjoined that the aldermen, deputies, and common councilmen shall meet together weekly, once, twice, thrice or oftener (as cause shall require), at some one general place accustomed in their respective wards (being clear from infection of the plague), to consult how the said orders may be duly put in execution; not intending that any dwelling in or near places infected shall come to the said meeting while their coming may be doubtful. And the said aldermen, and deputies, and common councilmen in their several wards may put in execution any other good orders that by them at their said meetings shall be conceived and devised for preservation of his Majesty's subjects from the infection.

        'SIR JOHN LAWRENCE, Lord Mayor.

        SIR GEORGE WATERMAN

        SIR CHARLES DOE, Sheriffs.'

        I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were within the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction, so it is requisite to observe that the justices of Peace within those parishes and places as were called the Hamlets and out-parts took the same method. As I remember, the orders for shutting up of houses did not take Place so soon on our side, because, as I said before, the plague did not reach to these eastern parts of the town at least, nor begin to be very violent, till the beginning of August. For example, the whole bill from the 11th to the 18th of July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague in all those parishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and they were as follows:—

-                                                The next week                        And to the 1st
-                                                was thus:                                  of Aug. thus:

        This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter lamentations. Complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought to my Lord Mayor, of houses causelessly (and some maliciously) shut up. I cannot say; but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found in a condition to be continued; and others again, inspection being made upon the sick person, and the sickness not appearing infectious, or if uncertain, yet on his being content to be carried to the pest-house, were released.

        It is true that the locking up the doors of people's houses, and setting a watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any coming to them, when perhaps the sound people in the family might have escaped if they had been removed from the sick, looked very hard and cruel; and many people perished in these miserable confinements which, 'tis reasonable to believe, would not have been distempered if they had had liberty, though the plague was in the house; at which the people were very clamorous and uneasy at first, and several violences were committed and injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the houses so shut up; also several people broke out by force in many places, as I shall observe by-and-by. But it was a public good that justified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the least mitigation by any application to magistrates or government at that time, at least not that I heard of. This put the people upon all manner of stratagem in order, if possible, to get out; and it would fill a little volume to set down the arts used by the people of such houses to shut the eyes of the watchmen who were employed, to deceive them, and to escape or break out from them, in which frequent scuffles and some mischief happened; of which by itself.

        As I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o'clock there was a great noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd, because people were not very free to gather together, or to stay long together when they were there; nor did I stay long there. But the outcry was loud enough to prompt my curiosity, and I called to one that looked out of a window, and asked what was the matter.

        A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the door of a house which was infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up. He had been there all night for two nights together, as he told his story, and the day-watchman had been there one day, and was now come to relieve him. All this while no noise had been heard in the house, no light had been seen; they called for nothing, sent him of no errands, which used to be the chief business of the watchmen; neither had they given him any disturbance, as he said, from the Monday afternoon, when he heard great crying and screaming in the house, which, as he supposed, was occasioned by some of the family dying just at that time. It seems, the night before, the dead-cart, as it was called, had been stopped there, and a servant-maid had been brought down to the door dead, and the buriers or bearers, as they were called, put her into the cart, wrapt only in a green rug, and carried her away.

        The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard that noise and crying, as above, and nobody answered a great while; but at last one looked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and yet a kind of crying voice, or a voice of one that was crying, 'What d'ye want, that ye make such a knocking?' He answered, 'I am the watchman! How do you do? What is the matter?' The person answered, 'What is that to you? Stop the dead-cart.' This, it seems, was about one o'clock. Soon after, as the fellow said, he stopped the dead-cart, and then knocked again, but nobody answered. He continued knocking, and the bellman called out several times, 'Bring out your dead'; but nobody answered, till the man that drove the cart, being called to other houses, would stay no longer, and drove away.

        The watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them alone till the morning-man or day-watchman, as they called him, came to relieve him. Giving him an account of the particulars, they knocked at the door a great while, but nobody answered; and they observed that the window or casement at which the person had looked out who had answered before continued open, being up two pair of stairs.

        Upon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long ladder, and one of them went up to the window and looked into the room, where he saw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner, having no clothes on her but her shift. But though he called aloud, and putting in his long staff, knocked hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred or answered; neither could he hear any noise in the house.

        He came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went up also; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either the Lord Mayor or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go in at the window. The magistrate, it seems, upon the information of the two men, ordered the house to be broke open, a constable and other persons being appointed to be present, that nothing might be plundered; and accordingly it was so done, when nobody was found in the house but that young woman, who having been infected and past recovery, the rest had left her to die by herself, and were every one gone, having found some way to delude the watchman, and to get open the door, or get out at some back-door, or over the tops of the houses, so that he knew nothing of it; and as to those cries and shrieks which he heard, it was supposed they were the passionate cries of the family at the bitter parting, which, to be sure, it was to them all, this being the sister to the mistress of the family. The man of the house, his wife, several children, and servants, being all gone and fled, whether sick or sound, that I could never learn; nor, indeed, did I make much inquiry after it.

        Many such escapes were made out of infected houses, as particularly when the watchman was sent of some errand; for it was his business to go of any errand that the family sent him of; that is to say, for necessaries, such as food and physic; to fetch physicians, if they would come, or surgeons, or nurses, or to order the dead-cart, and the like; but with this condition, too, that when he went he was to lock up the outer door of the house and take the key away with him, To evade this, and cheat the watchmen, people got two or three keys made to their locks, or they found ways to unscrew the locks such as were screwed on, and so take off the lock, being in the inside of the house, and while they sent away the watchman to the market, to the bakehouse, or for one trifle or another, open the door and go out as often as they pleased. But this being found out, the officers afterwards had orders to padlock up the doors on the outside, and place bolts on them as they thought fit.

        At another house, as I was informed, in the street next within Aldgate, a whole family was shut up and locked in because the maid-servant was taken sick. The master of the house had complained by his friends to the next alderman and to the Lord Mayor, and had consented to have the maid carried to the pest-house, but was refused; so the door was marked with a red cross, a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to keep the door, according to public order.

        After the master of the house found there was no remedy, but that he, his wife, and his children were to be locked up with this poor distempered servant, he called to the watchman, and told him he must go then and fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor girl, for that it would be certain death to them all to oblige them to nurse her; and told him plainly that if he would not do this, the maid must perish either of the distemper or be starved for want of food, for he was resolved none of his family should go near her; and she lay in the garret four storey high, where she could not cry out, or call to anybody for help.

        The watchman consented to that, and went and fetched a nurse, as he was appointed, and brought her to them the same evening. During this interval the master of the house took his opportunity to break a large hole through his shop into a bulk or stall, where formerly a cobbler had sat, before or under his shop-window; but the tenant, as may be supposed at such a dismal time as that, was dead or removed, and so he had the key in his own keeping. Having made his way into this stall, which he could not have done if the man had been at the door, the noise he was obliged to make being such as would have alarmed the watchman; I say, having made his way into this stall, he sat still till the watchman returned with the nurse, and all the next day also. But the night following, having contrived to send the watchman of another trifling errand, which, as I take it, was to an apothecary's for a plaister for the maid, which he was to stay for the making up, or some other such errand that might secure his staying some time; in that time he conveyed himself and all his family out of the house, and left the nurse and the watchman to bury the poor wench—that is, throw her into the cart—and take care of the house.

        I could give a great many such stories as these, diverting enough, which in the long course of that dismal year I met with—that is, heard of—and which are very certain to be true, or very near the truth; that is to say, true in the general: for no man could at such a time learn all the particulars. There was likewise violence used with the watchmen, as was reported, in abundance of places; and I believe that from the beginning of the visitation to the end, there was not less than eighteen or twenty of them killed, or so wounded as to be taken up for dead, which was supposed to be done by the people in the infected houses which were shut up, and where they attempted to come out and were opposed.

        Nor, indeed, could less be expected, for here were so many prisons in the town as there were houses shut up; and as the people shut up or imprisoned so were guilty of no crime, only shut up because miserable, it was really the more intolerable to them.

        It had also this difference, that every prison, as we may call it, had but one jailer, and as he had the whole house to guard, and that many houses were so situated as that they had several ways out, some more, some less, and some into several streets, it was impossible for one man so to guard all the passages as to prevent the escape of people made desperate by the fright of their circumstances, by the resentment of their usage, or by the raging of the distemper itself; so that they would talk to the watchman on one side of the house, while the family made their escape at another.

        For example, in Coleman Street there are abundance of alleys, as appears still. A house was shut up in that they call White's Alley; and this house had a back-window, not a door, into a court which had a passage into Bell Alley. A watchman was set by the constable at the door of this house, and there he stood, or his comrade, night and day, while the family went all away in the evening out at that window into the court, and left the poor fellows warding and watching for near a fortnight.

        Not far from the same place they blew up a watchman with gunpowder, and burned the poor fellow dreadfully; and while he made hideous cries, and nobody would venture to come near to help him, the whole family that were able to stir got out at the windows one storey high, two that were left sick calling out for help. Care was taken to give them nurses to look after them, but the persons fled were never found, till after the plague was abated they returned; but as nothing could be proved, so nothing could be done to them.

        It is to be considered, too, that as these were prisons without bars and bolts, which our common prisons are furnished with, so the people let themselves down out of their windows, even in the face of the watchman, bringing swords or pistols in their hands, and threatening the poor wretch to shoot him if he stirred or called for help.

        In other cases, some had gardens, and walls or pales, between them and their neighbours, or yards and back-houses; and these, by friendship and entreaties, would get leave to get over those walls or pales, and so go out at their neighbours' doors; or, by giving money to their servants, get them to let them through in the night; so that in short, the shutting up of houses was in no wise to be depended upon. Neither did it answer the end at all, serving more to make the people desperate, and drive them to such extremities as that they would break out at all adventures.

        And that which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the infection farther by their wandering about with the distemper upon them, in their desperate circumstances, than they would otherwise have done; for whoever considers all the particulars in such cases must acknowledge, and we cannot doubt but the severity of those confinements made many people desperate, and made them run out of their houses at all hazards, and with the plague visibly upon them, not knowing either whither to go or what to do, or, indeed, what they did; and many that did so were driven to dreadful exigencies and extremities, and perished in the streets or fields for mere want, or dropped down by the raging violence of the fever upon them. Others wandered into the country, and went forward any way, as their desperation guided them, not knowing whither they went or would go: till, faint and tired, and not getting any relief, the houses and villages on the road refusing to admit them to lodge whether infected or no, they have perished by the roadside or gotten into barns and died there, none daring to come to them or relieve them, though perhaps not infected, for nobody would believe them.

        On the other hand, when the plague at first seized a family that is to say, when any body of the family had gone out and unwarily or otherwise catched the distemper and brought it home—it was certainly known by the family before it was known to the officers, who, as you will see by the order, were appointed to examine into the circumstances of all sick persons when they heard of their being sick.

        In this interval, between their being taken sick and the examiners coming, the master of the house had leisure and liberty to remove himself or all his family, if he knew whither to go, and many did so. But the great disaster was that many did thus after they were really infected themselves, and so carried the disease into the houses of those who were so hospitable as to receive them; which, it must be confessed, was very cruel and ungrateful.

        And this was in part the reason of the general notion, or scandal rather, which went about of the temper of people infected: namely, that they did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others, though I cannot say but there might be some truth in it too, but not so general as was reported. What natural reason could be given for so wicked a thing at a time when they might conclude themselves just going to appear at the bar of Divine justice I know not. I am very well satisfied that it cannot be reconciled to religion and principle any more than it can be to generosity and Humanity, but I may speak of that again.

        I am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions of their being shut up, and their breaking out by stratagem or force, either before or after they were shut up, whose misery was not lessened when they were out, but sadly increased. On the other hand, many that thus got away had retreats to go to and other houses, where they locked themselves up and kept hid till the plague was over; and many families, foreseeing the approach of the distemper, laid up stores of provisions sufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so entirely that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was quite ceased, and then came abroad sound and well. I might recollect several such as these, and give you the particulars of their management; for doubtless it was the most effectual secure step that could be taken for such whose circumstances would not admit them to remove, or who had not retreats abroad proper for the case; for in being thus shut up they were as if they had been a hundred miles off. Nor do I remember that any one of those families miscarried. Among these, several Dutch merchants were particularly remarkable, who kept their houses like little garrisons besieged suffering none to go in or out or come near them, particularly one in a court in Throgmorton Street whose house looked into Draper's Garden.

        But I come back to the case of families infected and shut up by the magistrates. The misery of those families is not to be expressed; and it was generally in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks and outcries of the poor people, terrified and even frighted to death by the sight of the condition of their dearest relations, and by the terror of being imprisoned as they were.

        I remember, and while I am writing this story I think I hear the very sound of it, a certain lady had an only daughter, a young maiden about nineteen years old, and who was possessed of a very considerable fortune. They were only lodgers in the house where they were. The young woman, her mother, and the maid had been abroad on some occasion, I do not remember what, for the house was not shut up; but about two hours after they came home the young lady complained she was not well; in a quarter of an hour more she vomited and had a violent pain in her head. 'Pray God', says her mother, in a terrible fright, 'my child has not the distemper!' The pain in her head increasing, her mother ordered the bed to be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and prepared to give her things to sweat, which was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the first apprehensions of the distemper began.

        While the bed was airing the mother undressed the young woman, and just as she was laid down in the bed, she, looking upon her body with a candle, immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the inside of her thighs. Her mother, not being able to contain herself, threw down her candle and shrieked out in such a frightful manner that it was enough to place horror upon the stoutest heart in the world; nor was it one scream or one cry, but the fright having seized her spirits, she—fainted first, then recovered, then ran all over the house, up the stairs and down the stairs, like one distracted, and indeed really was distracted, and continued screeching and crying out for several hours void of all sense, or at least government of her senses, and, as I was told, never came thoroughly to herself again. As to the young maiden, she was a dead corpse from that moment, for the gangrene which occasions the spots had spread [over] her whole body, and she died in less than two hours. But still the mother continued crying out, not knowing anything more of her child, several hours after she was dead. It is so long ago that I am not certain, but I think the mother never recovered, but died in two or three weeks after.

        This was an extraordinary case, and I am therefore the more particular in it, because I came so much to the knowledge of it; but there were innumerable such-like cases, and it was seldom that the weekly bill came in but there were two or three put in, 'frighted'; that is, that may well be called frighted to death. But besides those who were so frighted as to die upon the spot, there were great numbers frighted to other extremes, some frighted out of their senses, some out of their memory, and some out of their understanding. But I return to the shutting up of houses.

        As several people, I say, got out of their houses by stratagem after they were shut UP, so others got out by bribing the watchmen, and giving them money to let them go privately out in the night. I must confess I thought it at that time the most innocent corruption or bribery that any man could be guilty of, and therefore could not but pity the poor men, and think it was hard when three of those watchmen were publicly whipped through the streets for suffering people to go out of houses shut up.

        But notwithstanding that severity, money prevailed with the poor men, and many families found means to make sallies out, and escape that way after they had been shut up; but these were generally such as had some places to retire to; and though there was no easy passing the roads any whither after the 1st of August, yet there were many ways of retreat, and particularly, as I hinted, some got tents and set them up in the fields, carrying beds or straw to lie on, and provisions to eat, and so lived in them as hermits in a cell, for nobody would venture to come near them; and several stories were told of such, some comical, some tragical, some who lived like wandering pilgrims in the deserts, and escaped by making themselves exiles in such a manner as is scarce to be credited, and who yet enjoyed more liberty than was to be expected in such cases.

        I have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman, who being single men, but that had stayed in the city too long to get away, and indeed not knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor having wherewith to travel far, took a course for their own preservation, which though in itself at first desperate, yet was so natural that it may be wondered that no more did so at that time. They were but of mean condition, and yet not so very poor as that they could not furnish themselves with some little conveniences such as might serve to keep life and soul together; and finding the distemper increasing in a terrible manner, they resolved to shift as well as they could, and to be gone.

        One of them had been a soldier in the late wars, and before that in the Low Countries, and having been bred to no particular employment but his arms, and besides being wounded, and not able to work very hard, had for some time been employed at a baker's of sea-biscuit in Wapping.

        The brother of this man was a seaman too, but somehow or other had been hurt of one leg, that he could not go to sea, but had worked for his living at a sailmaker's in Wapping, or thereabouts; and being a good husband, had laid up some money, and was the richest of the three.

        The third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade, a handy fellow, and he had no wealth but his box or basket of tools, with the help of which he could at any time get his living, such a time as this excepted, wherever he went—and he lived near Shadwell.

        They all lived in Stepney parish, which, as I have said, being the last that was infected, or at least violently, they stayed there till they evidently saw the plague was abating at the west part of the town, and coming towards the east, where they lived.

        The story of those three men, if the reader will be content to have me give it in their own persons, without taking upon me to either vouch the particulars or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as distinctly as I can, believing the history will be a very good pattern for any poor man to follow, in case the like public desolation should happen here; and if there may be no such occasion, which God of His infinite mercy grant us, still the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, I hope, never be said that the relating has been unprofitable.

        I say all this previous to the history, having yet, for the present, much more to say before I quit my own part.

        I went all the first part of the time freely about the streets, though not so freely as to run myself into apparent danger, except when they dug the great pit in the churchyard of our parish of Aldgate. A terrible pit it was, and I could not resist my curiosity to go and see it. As near as I may judge, it was about forty feet in length, and about fifteen or sixteen feet broad, and at the time I first looked at it, about nine feet deep; but it was said they dug it near twenty feet deep afterwards in one part of it, till they could go no deeper for the water; for they had, it seems, dug several large pits before this. For though the plague was long a-coming to our parish, yet, when it did come, there was no parish in or about London where it raged with such violence as in the two parishes of Aldgate and Whitechappel.

        I say they had dug several pits in another ground, when the distemper began to spread in our parish, and especially when the dead-carts began to go about, which was not, in our parish, till the beginning of August. Into these pits they had put perhaps fifty or sixty bodies each; then they made larger holes wherein they buried all that the cart brought in a week, which, by the middle to the end of August, came to from 200 to 400 a week; and they could not well dig them larger, because of the order of the magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within six feet of the surface; and the water coming on at about seventeen or eighteen feet, they could not well, I say, put more in one pit. But now, at the beginning of September, the plague raging in a dreadful manner, and the number of burials in our parish increasing to more than was ever buried in any parish about London of no larger extent, they ordered this dreadful gulf to be dug—for such it was, rather than a pit.

        They had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month or more when they dug it, and some blamed the churchwardens for suffering such a frightful thing, telling them they were making preparations to bury the whole parish, and the like; but time made it appear the churchwardens knew the condition of the parish better than they did: for, the pit being finished the 4th of September, I think, they began to bury in it the 6th, and by the 20th, which was just two weeks, they had thrown into it 1114 bodies when they were obliged to fill it up, the bodies being then come to lie within six feet of the surface. I doubt not but there may be some ancient persons alive in the parish who can justify the fact of this, and are able to show even in what place of the churchyard the pit lay better than I can. The mark of it also was many years to be seen in the churchyard on the surface, lying in length parallel with the passage which goes by the west wall of the churchyard out of Houndsditch, and turns east again into Whitechappel, coming out near the Three Nuns' Inn.

        It was about the 10th of September that my curiosity led, or rather drove, me to go and see this pit again, when there had been near 400 people buried in it; and I was not content to see it in the day-time, as I had done before, for then there would have been nothing to have been seen but the loose earth; for all the bodies that were thrown in were immediately covered with earth by those they called the buriers, which at other times were called bearers; but I resolved to go in the night and see some of them thrown in.

        There was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits, and that was only to prevent infection. But after some time that order was more necessary, for people that were infected and near their end, and delirious also, would run to those pits, wrapt in blankets or rugs, and throw themselves in, and, as they said, bury themselves. I cannot say that the officers suffered any willingly to lie there; but I have heard that in a great pit in Finsbury, in the parish of Cripplegate, it lying open then to the fields, for it was not then walled about, [many] came and threw themselves in, and expired there, before they threw any earth upon them; and that when they came to bury others and found them there, they were quite dead, though not cold.

        This may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of that day, though it is impossible to say anything that is able to give a true idea of it to those who did not see it, other than this, that it was indeed very, very, very dreadful, and such as no tongue can express.

        I got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the sexton who attended; who, though he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly persuaded me not to go, telling me very seriously (for he was a good, religious, and sensible man) that it was indeed their business and duty to venture, and to run all hazards, and that in it they might hope to be preserved; but that I had no apparent call to it but my own curiosity, which, he said, he believed I would not pretend was sufficient to justify my running that hazard. I told him I had been pressed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an instructing sight, that might not be without its uses. 'Nay,' says the good man, 'if you will venture upon that score, name of God go in; for, depend upon it, 'twill be a sermon to you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in your life. 'Tis a speaking sight,' says he, 'and has a voice with it, and a loud one, to call us all to repentance'; and with that he opened the door and said, 'Go, if you will.'

        His discourse had shocked my resolution a little, and I stood wavering for a good while, but just at that interval I saw two links come over from the end of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and then appeared a dead-cart, as they called it, coming over the streets; so I could no longer resist my desire of seeing it, and went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive at first, in the churchyard, or going into it, but the buriers and the fellow that drove the cart, or rather led the horse and cart; but when they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and again, muffled up in a brown Cloak, and making motions with his hands under his cloak, as if he was in great agony, and the buriers immediately gathered about him, supposing he was one of those poor delirious or desperate creatures that used to pretend, as I have said, to bury themselves. He said nothing as he walked about, but two or three times groaned very deeply and loud, and sighed as he would break his heart.

        When the buriers came up to him they soon found he was neither a person infected and desperate, as I have observed above, or a person distempered—in mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of grief indeed, having his wife and several of his children all in the cart that was just come in with him, and he followed in an agony and excess of sorrow. He mourned heartily, as it was easy to see, but with a kind of masculine grief that could not give itself vent by tears; and calmly defying the buriers to let him alone, said he would only see the bodies thrown in and go away, so they left importuning him. But no sooner was the cart turned round and the bodies shot into the pit promiscuously, which was a surprise to him, for he at least expected they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was impracticable; I say, no sooner did he see the sight but he cried out aloud, unable to contain himself. I could not hear what he said, but he went backward two or three steps and fell down in a swoon. The buriers ran to him and took him up, and in a little while he came to himself, and they led him away to the Pie Tavern over against the end of Houndsditch, where, it seems, the man was known, and where they took care of him. He looked into the pit again as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies so immediately with throwing in earth, that though there was light enough, for there were lanterns, and candles in them, placed all night round the sides of the pit, upon heaps of earth, seven or eight, or perhaps more, yet nothing could be seen.

        This was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me almost as much as the rest; but the other was awful and full of terror. The cart had in it sixteen or seventeen bodies; some were wrapt up in linen sheets, some in rags, some little other than naked, or so loose that what covering they had fell from them in the shooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the rest; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one else, seeing they were all dead, and were to be huddled together into the common grave of mankind, as we may call it, for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it possible there should, for coffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that fell in such a calamity as this.

        It was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers, that if any corpse was delivered to them decently wound up, as we called it then, in a winding-sheet tied over the head and feet, which some did, and which was generally of good linen; I say, it was reported that the buriers were so wicked as to strip them in the cart and carry them quite naked to the ground. But as I cannot easily credit anything so vile among Christians, and at a time so filled with terrors as that was, I can only relate it and leave it undetermined.

        Innumerable stories also went about of the cruel behaviours and practices of nurses who tended the sick, and of their hastening on the fate of those they tended in their sickness. But I shall say more of this in its place.

        I was indeed shocked with this sight; it almost overwhelmed me, and I went away with my heart most afflicted, and full of the afflicting thoughts, such as I cannot describe just at my going out of the church, and turning up the street towards my own house, I saw another cart with links, and a bellman going before, coming out of Harrow Alley in the Butcher Row, on the other side of the way, and being, as I perceived, very full of dead bodies, it went directly over the street also toward the church. I stood a while, but I had no stomach to go back again to see the same dismal scene over again, so I went directly home, where I could not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had run, believing I had gotten no injury, as indeed I had not.

        Here the poor unhappy gentleman's grief came into my head again, and indeed I could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it, perhaps more than he did himself; but his case lay so heavy upon my mind that I could not prevail with myself, but that I must go out again into the street, and go to the Pie Tavern, resolving to inquire what became of him.

        It was by this time one o'clock in the morning, and yet the poor gentleman was there. The truth was, the people of the house, knowing him, had entertained him, and kept him there all the night, notwithstanding the danger of being infected by him, though it appeared the man was perfectly sound himself.

        It is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. The people were civil, mannerly, and an obliging sort of folks enough, and had till this time kept their house open and their trade going on, though not so very publicly as formerly: but there was a dreadful set of fellows that used their house, and who, in the middle of all this horror, met there every night, behaved with all the revelling and roaring extravagances as is usual for such people to do at other times, and, indeed, to such an offensive degree that the very master and mistress of the house grew first ashamed and then terrified at them.

        They sat generally in a room next the street, and as they always kept late hours, so when the dead-cart came across the street-end to go into Houndsditch, which was in view of the tavern windows, they would frequently open the windows as soon as they heard the bell and look out at them; and as they might often hear sad lamentations of people in the streets or at their windows as the carts went along, they would make their impudent mocks and jeers at them, especially if they heard the poor people call upon God to have mercy upon them, as many would do at those times in their ordinary passing along the streets.

        These gentlemen, being something disturbed with the clutter of bringing the poor gentleman into the house, as above, were first angry and very high with the master of the house for suffering such a fellow, as they called him, to be brought out of the grave into their house; but being answered that the man was a neighbour, and that he was sound, but overwhelmed with the calamity of his family, and the like, they turned their anger into ridiculing the man and his sorrow for his wife and children, taunted him with want of courage to leap into the great pit and go to heaven, as they jeeringly expressed it, along with them, adding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions.

        They were at this vile work when I came back to the house, and, as far as I could see, though the man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and their affronts could not divert his sorrow, yet he was both grieved and offended at their discourse. Upon this I gently reproved them, being well enough acquainted with their characters, and not unknown in person to two of them.

        They immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths, asked me what I did out of my grave at such a time when so many honester men were carried into the churchyard, and why I was not at home saying my prayers against the dead-cart came for me, and the like.

        I was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men, though not at all discomposed at their treatment of me. However, I kept my temper. I told them that though I defied them or any man in the world to tax me with any dishonesty, yet I acknowledged that in this terrible judgement of God many better than I were swept away and carried to their grave. But to answer their question directly, the case was, that I was mercifully preserved by that great God whose name they had blasphemed and taken in vain by cursing and swearing in a dreadful manner, and that I believed I was preserved in particular, among other ends of His goodness, that I might reprove them for their audacious boldness in behaving in such a manner and in such an awful time as this was, especially for their jeering and mocking at an honest gentleman and a neighbour (for some of them knew him), who, they saw, was overwhelmed with sorrow for the breaches which it had pleased God to make upon his family.

        I cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abominable raillery which was the return they made to that talk of mine: being provoked, it seems, that I was not at all afraid to be free with them; nor, if I could remember, would I fill my account with any of the words, the horrid oaths, curses, and vile expressions, such as, at that time of the day, even the worst and ordinariest people in the street would not use; for, except such hardened creatures as these, the most wicked wretches that could be found had at that time some terror upon their minds of the hand of that Power which could thus in a moment destroy them.

        But that which was the worst in all their devilish language was, that they were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk atheistically, making a jest of my calling the plague the hand of God; mocking, and even laughing, at the word judgement, as if the providence of God had no concern in the inflicting such a desolating stroke; and that the people calling upon God as they saw the carts carrying away the dead bodies was all enthusiastic, absurd, and impertinent.

        I made them some reply, such as I thought proper, but which I found was so far from putting a check to their horrid way of speaking that it made them rail the more, so that I confess it filled me with horror and a kind of rage, and I came away, as I told them, lest the hand of that judgement which had visited the whole city should glorify His vengeance upon them, and all that were near them.

        They received all reproof with the utmost contempt, and made the greatest mockery that was possible for them to do at me, giving me all the opprobrious, insolent scoffs that they could think of for preaching to them, as they called it, which indeed grieved me, rather than angered me; and I went away, blessing God, however, in my mind that I had not spared them, though they had insulted me so much.

        They continued this wretched course three or four days after this, continually mocking and jeering at all that showed themselves religious or serious, or that were any way touched with the sense of the terrible judgement of God upon us; and I was informed they flouted in the same manner at the good people who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at the church, fasted, and prayed to God to remove His hand from them.

        I say, they continued this dreadful course three or four days—I think it was no more—when one of them, particularly he who asked the poor gentleman what he did out of his grave, was struck from Heaven with the plague, and died in a most deplorable manner; and, in a word, they were every one of them carried into the great pit which I have mentioned above, before it was quite filled up, which was not above a fortnight or thereabout.

        These men were guilty of many extravagances, such as one would think human nature should have trembled at the thoughts of at such a time of general terror as was then upon us, and particularly scoffing and mocking at everything which they happened to see that was religious among the people, especially at their thronging zealously to the place of public worship to implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of distress; and this tavern where they held their dub being within view of the church-door, they had the more particular occasion for their atheistical profane mirth.

        But this began to abate a little with them before the accident which I have related happened, for the infection increased so violently at this part of the town now, that people began to be afraid to come to the church; at least such numbers did not resort thither as was usual. Many of the clergymen likewise were dead, and others gone into the country; for it really required a steady courage and a strong faith for a man not only to venture being in town at such a time as this, but likewise to venture to come to church and perform the office of a minister to a congregation, of whom he had reason to believe many of them were actually infected with the plague, and to do this every day, or twice a day, as in some places was done.

        It is true the people showed an extraordinary zeal in these religious exercises, and as the church-doors were always open, people would go in single at all times, whether the minister was officiating or no, and locking themselves into separate pews, would be praying to God with great fervency and devotion.

        Others assembled at meeting-houses, every one as their different opinions in such things guided, but all were promiscuously the subject of these men's drollery, especially at the beginning of the visitation.

        It seems they had been checked for their open insulting religion in this manner by several good people of every persuasion, and that, and the violent raging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion that they had abated much of their rudeness for some time before, and were only roused by the spirit of ribaldry and atheism at the clamour which was made when the gentleman was first brought in there, and perhaps were agitated by the same devil, when I took upon me to reprove them; though I did it at first with all the calmness, temper, and good manners that I could, which for a while they insulted me the more for thinking it had been in fear of their resentment, though afterwards they found the contrary.

        I went home, indeed, grieved and afflicted in my mind at the abominable wickedness of those men, not doubting, however, that they would be made dreadful examples of God's justice; for I looked upon this dismal time to be a particular season of Divine vengeance, and that God would on this occasion single out the proper objects of His displeasure in a more especial and remarkable manner than at another time; and that though I did believe that many good people would, and did, fall in the common calamity, and that it was no certain rule to judge of the eternal state of any one by their being distinguished in such a time of general destruction neither one way or other; yet, I say, it could not but seem reasonable to believe that God would not think fit to spare by His mercy such open declared enemies, that should insult His name and Being, defy His vengeance, and mock at His worship and worshippers at such a time; no, not though His mercy had thought fit to bear with and spare them at other times; that this was a day of visitation, a day of God's anger, and those words came into my thought, Jer. v. 9: 'Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not My soul be avenged of such a nation as this?'

        These things, I say, lay upon my mind, and I went home very much grieved and oppressed with the horror of these men's wickedness, and to think that anything could be so vile, so hardened, and notoriously wicked as to insult God, and His servants, and His worship in such a manner, and at such a time as this was, when He had, as it were, His sword drawn in His hand on purpose to take vengeance not on them only, but on the whole nation.

        I had, indeed, been in some passion at first with them—though it was really raised, not by any affront they had offered me personally, but by the horror their blaspheming tongues filled me with. However, I was doubtful in my thoughts whether the resentment I retained was not all upon my own private account, for they had given me a great deal of ill language too—I mean personally; but after some pause, and having a weight of grief upon my mind, I retired myself as soon as I came home, for I slept not that night; and giving God most humble thanks for my preservation in the eminent danger I had been in, I set my mind seriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for those desperate wretches, that God would pardon them, open their eyes, and effectually humble them.

        By this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray for those who despitefully used me, but I fully tried my own heart, to my fun satisfaction, that it was not filled with any spirit of resentment as they had offended me in particular; and I humbly recommend the method to all those that would know, or be certain, how to distinguish between their zeal for the honour of God and the effects of their private passions and resentment.

        But I must go back here to the particular incidents which occur to my thoughts of the time of the visitation, and particularly to the time of their shutting up houses in the first part of their sickness; for before the sickness was come to its height people had more room to make their observations than they had afterward; but when it was in the extremity there was no such thing as communication with one another, as before.

        During the shutting up of houses, as I have said, some violence was offered to the watchmen. As to soldiers, there were none to be found. The few guards which the king then had, which were nothing like the number entertained since, were dispersed, either at Oxford with the Court, or in quarters in the remoter parts of the country, small detachments excepted, who did duty at the Tower and at Whitehall, and these but very few. Neither am I positive that there was any other guard at the Tower than the warders, as they called them, who stand at the gate with gowns and caps, the same as the yeomen of the guard, except the ordinary gunners, who were twenty-four, and the officers appointed to look after the magazine, who were called armourers. As to trained bands, there was no possibility of raising any; neither, if the Lieutenancy, either of London or Middlesex, had ordered the drums to beat for the militia, would any of the companies, I believe, have drawn together, whatever risk they had run.

        This made the watchmen be the less regarded, and perhaps occasioned the greater violence to be used against them. I mention it on this score to observe that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was, first of all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by force or by stratagem, even almost as often as they pleased; and, second, that those that did thus break out were generally people infected who, in their desperation, running about from one place to another, valued not whom they injured: and which perhaps, as I have said, might give birth to report that it was natural to the infected people to desire to infect others, which report was really false.

        And I know it so well, and in so many several cases, that I could give several relations of good, pious, and religious people who, when they have had the distemper, have been so far from being forward to infect others that they have forbid their own family to come near them, in hopes of their being preserved, and have even died without seeing their nearest relations lest they should be instrumental to give them the distemper, and infect or endanger them. If, then, there were cases wherein the infected people were careless of the injury they did to others, this was certainly one of them, if not the chief, namely, when people who had the distemper had broken out from houses which were so shut up, and having been driven to extremities for provision or for entertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their condition, and have been thereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who have been ignorant and unwary.

        This is one of the reasons why I believed then, and do believe still, that the shutting up houses thus by force, and restraining, or rather imprisoning, people in their own houses, as I said above, was of little or no service in the whole. Nay, I am of opinion it was rather hurtful, having forced those desperate people to wander abroad with the plague upon them, who would otherwise have died quietly in their beds.

        I remember one citizen who, having thus broken out of his house in Aldersgate Street or thereabout, went along the road to Islington; he attempted to have gone in at the Angel Inn, and after that the White Horse, two inns known still by the same signs, but was refused; after which he came to the Pied Bull, an inn also still continuing the same sign. He asked them for lodging for one night only, pretending to be going into Lincolnshire, and assuring them of his being very sound and free from the infection, which also at that time had not reached much that way.

        They told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one bed up in the garret, and that they could spare that bed for one night, some drovers being expected the next day with cattle; so, if he would accept of that lodging, he might have it, which he did. So a servant was sent up with a candle with him to show him the room. He was very well dressed, and looked like a person not used to lie in a garret; and when he came to the room he fetched a deep sigh, and said to the servant, 'I have seldom lain in such a lodging as this. 'However, the servant assuring him again that they had no better, 'Well,' says he, 'I must make shift; this is a dreadful time; but it is but for one night.' So he sat down upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him up a pint of warm ale. Accordingly the servant went for the ale, but some hurry in the house, which perhaps employed her other ways, put it out of her head, and she went up no more to him.

        The next morning, seeing no appearance of the gentleman, somebody in the house asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what was become of him. She started. 'Alas I,' says she, 'I never thought more of him. He bade me carry him some warm ale, but I forgot.' Upon which, not the maid, but some other person was sent up to see after him, who, coming into the room, found him stark dead and almost cold, stretched out across the bed. His clothes were pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes open in a most frightful posture, the rug of the bed being grasped hard in one of his hands, so that it was plain he died soon after the maid left him; and 'tis probable, had she gone up with the ale, she had found him dead in a few minutes after he sat down upon the bed. The alarm was great in the house, as anyone may suppose, they having been free from the distemper till that disaster, which, bringing the infection to the house, spread it immediately to other houses round about it. I do not remember how many died in the house itself, but I think the maid-servant who went up first with him fell presently ill by the fright, and several others; for, whereas there died but two in Islington of the plague the week before, there died seventeen the week after, whereof fourteen were of the plague. This was in the week from the 11th of July to the 18th.

        There was one shift that some families had, and that not a few, when their houses happened to be infected, and that was this: the families who, in the first breaking-out of the distemper, fled away into the country and had retreats among their friends, generally found some or other of their neighbours or relations to commit the charge of those houses to for the safety of the goods and the like. Some houses were, indeed, entirely locked up, the doors padlocked, the windows and doors having deal boards nailed over them, and only the inspection of them committed to the ordinary watchmen and parish officers; but these were but few.

        It was thought that there were not less than 10,000 houses forsaken of the inhabitants in the city and suburbs, including what was in the out-parishes and in Surrey, or the side of the water they called Southwark. This was besides the numbers of lodgers, and of particular persons who were fled out of other families; so that in all it was computed that about 200,000 people were fled and gone. But of this I shall speak again. But I mention it here on this account, namely, that it was a rule with those who had thus two houses in their keeping or care, that if anybody was taken sick in a family, before the master of the family let the examiners or any other officer know of it, he immediately would send all the rest of his family, whether children or servants, as it fell out to be, to such other house which he had so in charge, and then giving notice of the sick person to the examiner, have a nurse or nurses appointed, and have another person to be shut up in the house with them (which many for money would do), so to take charge of the house in case the person should die.

        This was, in many cases, the saving a whole family, who, if they had been shut up with the sick person, would inevitably have perished. But, on the other hand, this was another of the inconveniences of shutting up houses; for the apprehensions and terror of being shut up made many run away with the rest of the family, who, though it was not publicly known, and they were not quite sick, had yet the distemper upon them; and who, by having an uninterrupted liberty to go about, but being obliged still to conceal their circumstances, or perhaps not knowing it themselves, gave the distemper to others, and spread the infection in a dreadful manner, as I shall explain further hereafter.

        And here I may be able to make an observation or two of my own, which may be of use hereafter to those into whose hands these may come, if they should ever see the like dreadful visitation. (1) The infection generally came into the houses of the citizens by the means of their servants, whom they were obliged to send up and down the streets for necessaries; that is to say, for food or physic, to bakehouses, brew-houses, shops, &c.; and who going necessarily through the streets into shops, markets, and the like, it was impossible but that they should, one way or other, meet with distempered people, who conveyed the fatal breath into them, and they brought it home to the families to which they belonged. (2) It was a great mistake that such a great city as this had but one pest-house; for had there been, instead of one pest-house—viz., beyond Bunhill Fields, where, at most, they could receive, perhaps, two hundred or three hundred people—I say, had there, instead of that one, been several pest-houses, every one able to contain a thousand people, without lying two in a bed, or two beds in a room; and had every master of a family, as soon as any servant especially had been taken sick in his house, been obliged to send them to the next pest-house, if they were willing, as many were, and had the examiners done the like among the poor people when any had been stricken with the infection; I say, had this been done where the people were willing (not otherwise), and the houses not been shut, I am persuaded, and was all the while of that opinion, that not so many, by several thousands, had died; for it was observed, and I could give several instances within the compass of my own knowledge, where a servant had been taken sick, and the family had either time to send him out or retire from the house and leave the sick person, as I have said above, they had all been preserved; whereas when, upon one or more sickening in a family, the house has been shut up, the whole family have perished, and the bearers been obliged to go in to fetch out the dead bodies, not being able to bring them to the door, and at last none left to do it.

         (3) This put it out of question to me, that the calamity was spread by infection; that is to say, by some certain steams or fumes, which the physicians call effluvia, by the breath, or by the sweat, or by the stench of the sores of the sick persons, or some other way, perhaps, beyond even the reach of the physicians themselves, which effluvia affected the sound who came within certain distances of the sick, immediately penetrating the vital parts of the said sound persons, putting their blood into an immediate ferment, and agitating their spirits to that degree which it was found they were agitated; and so those newly infected persons communicated it in the same manner to others. And this I shall give some instances of, that cannot but convince those who seriously consider it; and I cannot but with some wonder find some people, now the contagion is over, talk of its being an immediate stroke from Heaven, without the agency of means, having commission to strike this and that particular person, and none other—which I look upon with contempt as the effect of manifest ignorance and enthusiasm; likewise the opinion of others, who talk of infection being carried on by the air only, by carrying with it vast numbers of insects and invisible creatures, who enter into the body with the breath, or even at the pores with the air, and there generate or emit most acute poisons, or poisonous ovae or eggs, which mingle themselves with the blood, and so infect the body: a discourse full of learned simplicity, and manifested to be so by universal experience; but I shall say more to this case in its order.

        I must here take further notice that nothing was more fatal to the inhabitants of this city than the supine negligence of the people themselves, who, during the long notice or warning they had of the visitation, made no provision for it by laying in store of provisions, or of other necessaries, by which they might have lived retired and within their own houses, as I have observed others did, and who were in a great measure preserved by that caution; nor were they, after they were a little hardened to it, so shy of conversing with one another, when actually infected, as they were at first: no, though they knew it.

        I acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless ones that had made so little provision that my servants were obliged to go out of doors to buy every trifle by penny and halfpenny, just as before it began, even till my experience showing me the folly, I began to be wiser so late that I had scarce time to store myself sufficient for our common subsistence for a month.

        I had in family only an ancient woman that managed the house, a maid-servant, two apprentices, and myself; and the plague beginning to increase about us, I had many sad thoughts about what course I should take, and how I should act. The many dismal objects which happened everywhere as I went about the streets, had filled my mind with a great deal of horror for fear of the distemper, which was indeed very horrible in itself, and in some more than in others. The swellings, which were generally in the neck or groin, when they grew hard and would not break, grew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture; and some, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at windows or shot themselves, or otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several dismal objects of that kind. Others, unable to contain themselves, vented their pain by incessant roarings, and such loud and lamentable cries were to be heard as we walked along the streets that would pierce the very heart to think of, especially when it was to be considered that the same dreadful scourge might be expected every moment to seize upon ourselves.

        I cannot say but that now I began to faint in my resolutions; my heart failed me very much, and sorely I repented of my rashness. When I had been out, and met with such terrible things as these I have talked of, I say I repented my rashness in venturing to abide in town. I wished often that I had not taken upon me to stay, but had gone away with my brother and his family.

        Terrified by those frightful objects, I would retire home sometimes and resolve to go out no more; and perhaps I would keep those resolutions for three or four days, which time I spent in the most serious thankfulness for my preservation and the preservation of my family, and the constant confession of my sins, giving myself up to God every day, and applying to Him with fasting, humiliation, and meditation. Such intervals as I had I employed in reading books and in writing down my memorandums of what occurred to me every day, and out of which afterwards I took most of this work, as it relates to my observations without doors. What I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for private use, and desire it may not be made public on any account whatever.

        I also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects, such as occurred to me at that time and were profitable to myself, but not fit for any other view, and therefore I say no more of that.

        I had a very good friend, a physician, whose name was Heath, whom I frequently visited during this dismal time, and to whose advice I was very much obliged for many things which he directed me to take, by way of preventing the infection when I went out, as he found I frequently did, and to hold in my mouth when I was in the streets. He also came very often to see me, and as he was a good Christian as well as a good physician, his agreeable conversation was a very great support to me in the worst of this terrible time.

        It was now the beginning of August, and the plague grew very violent and terrible in the place where I lived, and Dr Heath coming to visit me, and finding that I ventured so often out in the streets, earnestly persuaded me to lock myself up and my family, and not to suffer any of us to go out of doors; to keep all our windows fast, shutters and curtains close, and never to open them; but first, to make a very strong smoke in the room where the window or door was to be opened, with rozen and pitch, brimstone or gunpowder and the like; and we did this for some time; but as I had not laid in a store of provision for such a retreat, it was impossible that we could keep within doors entirely. However, I attempted, though it was so very late, to do something towards it; and first, as I had convenience both for brewing and baking, I went and bought two sacks of meal, and for several weeks, having an oven, we baked all our own bread; also I bought malt, and brewed as much beer as all the casks I had would hold, and which seemed enough to serve my house for five or six weeks; also I laid in a quantity of salt butter and Cheshire cheese; but I had no flesh-meat, and the plague raged so violently among the butchers and slaughter-houses on the other side of our street, where they are known to dwell in great numbers, that it was not advisable so much as to go over the street among them.

        And here I must observe again, that this necessity of going out of our houses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin of the whole city, for the people catched the distemper on these occasions one of another, and even the provisions themselves were often tainted; at least I have great reason to believe so; and therefore I cannot say with satisfaction what I know is repeated with great assurance, that the market-people and such as brought provisions to town were never infected. I am certain the butchers of Whitechappel, where the greatest part of the flesh-meat was killed, were dreadfully visited, and that at least to such a degree that few of their shops were kept open, and those that remained of them killed their meat at Mile End and that way, and brought it to market upon horses.

        However, the poor people could not lay up provisions, and there was a necessity that they must go to market to buy, and others to send servants or their children; and as this was a necessity which renewed itself daily, it brought abundance of unsound people to the markets, and a great many that went thither sound brought death home with them.

        It is true people used all possible precaution. When any one bought a joint of meat in the market they would not take it off the butcher's hand, but took it off the hooks themselves. On the other hand, the butcher would not touch the money, but have it put into a pot full of vinegar, which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried always small money to make up any odd sum, that they might take no change. They carried bottles of scents and perfumes in their hands, and all the means that could be used were used, but then the poor could not do even these things, and they went at all hazards.

        Innumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very account. Sometimes a man or woman dropped down dead in the very markets, for many people that had the plague upon them knew nothing of it till the inward gangrene had affected their vitals, and they died in a few moments. This caused that many died frequently in that manner in the streets suddenly, without any warning; others perhaps had time to go to the next bulk or stall, or to any door-porch, and just sit down and die, as I have said before.

        These objects were so frequent in the streets that when the plague came to be very raging on one side, there was scarce any passing by the streets but that several dead bodies would be lying here and there upon the ground. On the other hand, it is observable that though at first the people would stop as they went along and call to the neighbours to come out on such an occasion, yet afterward no notice was taken of them; but that if at any time we found a corpse lying, go across the way and not come near it; or, if in a narrow lane or passage, go back again and seek some other way to go on the business we were upon; and in those cases the corpse was always left till the officers had notice to come and take them away, or till night, when the bearers attending the dead-cart would take them up and carry them away. Nor did those undaunted creatures who performed these offices fail to search their pockets, and sometimes strip off their clothes if they were well dressed, as sometimes they were, and carry off what they could get.

        But to return to the markets. The butchers took that care that if any person died in the market they had the officers always at band to take them up upon hand-barrows and carry them to the next churchyard; and this was so frequent that such were not entered in the weekly bill, 'Found dead in the streets or fields', as is the case now, but they went into the general articles of the great distemper.

        But now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree that even the markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions or frequented with buyers compared to what they were before; and the Lord Mayor caused the country people who brought provisions to be stopped in the streets leading into the town, and to sit down there with their goods, where they sold what they brought, and went immediately away; and this encouraged the country people greatly-to do so, for they sold their provisions at the very entrances into the town, and even in the fields, as particularly in the fields beyond Whitechappel, in Spittlefields; also in St George's Fields in Southwark, in Bunhill Fields, and in a great field called Wood's Close, near Islington. Thither the Lord Mayor, aldermen, and magistrates sent their officers and servants to buy for their families, themselves keeping within doors as much as possible, and the like did many other people; and after this method was taken the country people came with great cheerfulness, and brought provisions of all sorts, and very seldom got any harm, which, I suppose, added also to that report of their being miraculously preserved.

        As for my little family, having thus, as I have said, laid in a store of bread, butter, cheese, and beer, I took my friend and physician's advice, and locked myself up, and my family, and resolved to suffer the hardship of living a few months without flesh-meat, rather than to purchase it at the hazard of our lives.

But though I confined my family, I could not prevail upon my unsatisfied curiosity to stay within entirely myself; and though I generally came frighted and terrified home, yet I could not restrain; only that indeed I did not do it so frequently as at first.

        I had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to go to my brother's house, which was in Coleman Street parish and which he had left to my care, and I went at first every day, but afterwards only once or twice a week.

        In these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as particularly of persons falling dead in the streets, terrible shrieks and screechings of women, who, in their agonies, would throw open their chamber windows and cry out in a dismal, surprising manner. It is impossible to describe the variety of postures in which the passions of the poor people would express themselves.

        Passing through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement violently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful screeches, and then cried, 'Oh! death, death, death!' in a most inimitable tone, and which struck me with horror and a chillness in my very blood. There was nobody to be seen in the whole street, neither did any other window open, for people had no curiosity now in any case, nor could anybody help one another, so I went on to pass into Bell Alley.

        Just in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a more terrible cry than that, though it was not so directed out at the window; but the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women and children run screaming about the rooms like distracted, when a garret-window opened and somebody from a window on the other side the alley called and asked, 'What is the matter?' upon which, from the first window, it was answered, 'Oh Lord, my old master has hanged himself!' The other asked again, 'Is he quite dead?' and the first answered, 'Ay, ay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!' This person was a merchant and a deputy alderman, and very rich. I care not to mention the name, though I knew his name too, but that would be an hardship to the family, which is now flourishing again.

        But this is but one; it is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of the distemper, or in the torment of their swellings, which was indeed intolerable, running out of their own government, raving and distracted, and oftentimes laying violent hands upon themselves, throwing themselves out at their windows, shooting themselves &c.; mothers murdering their own children in their lunacy, some dying of mere grief as a passion, some of mere fright and surprise without any infection at all, others frighted into idiotism and foolish distractions, some into despair and lunacy, others into melancholy madness.

        The pain of the swelling was in particular very violent, and to some intolerable; the physicians and surgeons may be said to have tortured many poor creatures even to death. The swellings in some grew hard, and they applied violent drawing-plaisters or poultices to break them, and if these did not do they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner. In some those swellings were made hard partly by the force of the distemper and partly by their being too violently drawn, and were so hard that no instrument could cut them, and then they burnt them with caustics, so that many died raving mad with the torment, and some in the very operation. In these distresses, some, for want of help to hold them down in their beds, or to look to them, laid hands upon themselves as above. Some broke out into the streets, perhaps naked, and would run directly down to the river if they were not stopped by the watchman or other officers, and plunge themselves into the water wherever they found it.

        It often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of those who were thus tormented, but of the two this was counted the most promising particular in the whole infection, for if these swellings could be brought to a head, and to break and run, or, as the surgeons call it, to digest, the patient generally recovered; whereas those who, like the gentlewoman's daughter, were struck with death at the beginning, and had the tokens come out upon them, often went about indifferent easy till a little before they died, and some till the moment they dropped down, as in apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. Such would be taken suddenly very sick, and would run to a bench or bulk, or any convenient place that offered itself, or to their own houses if possible, as I mentioned before, and there sit down, grow faint, and die. This kind of dying was much the same as it was with those who die of common mortifications, who die swooning, and, as it were, go away in a dream. Such as died thus had very little notice of their being infected at all till the gangrene was spread through their whole body; nor could physicians themselves know certainly how it was with them till they opened their breasts or other parts of their body and saw the tokens.

        We had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of nurses and watchmen who looked after the dying people; that is to say, hired nurses who attended infected people, using them barbarously, starving them, smothering them, or by other wicked means hastening their end, that is to say, murdering of them; and watchmen, being set to guard houses that were shut up when there has been but one person left, and perhaps that one lying sick, that they have broke in and murdered that body, and immediately thrown them out into the dead-cart! And so they have gone scarce cold to the grave.

        I cannot say but that some such murders were committed, and I think two were sent to prison for it, but died before they could be tried; and I have heard that three others, at several times, were excused for murders of that kind; but I must say I believe nothing of its being so common a crime as some have since been pleased to say, nor did it seem to be so rational where the people were brought so low as not to be able to help themselves, for such seldom recovered, and there was no temptation to commit a murder, at least none equal to the fact, where they were sure persons would die in so short a time, and could not live.

        That there were a great many robberies and wicked practices committed even in this dreadful time I do not deny. The power of avarice was so strong in some that they would run any hazard to steal and to plunder; and particularly in houses where all the families or inhabitants have been dead and carried out, they would break in at all hazards, and without regard to the danger of infection, take even the clothes off the dead bodies and the bed-clothes from others where they lay dead.

        This, I suppose, must be the case of a family in Houndsditch, where a man and his daughter, the rest of the family being, as I suppose, carried away before by the dead-cart, were found stark naked, one in one chamber and one in another, lying dead on the floor, and the clothes of the beds, from whence 'tis supposed they were rolled off by thieves, stolen and carried quite away.

        It is indeed to be observed that the women were in all this calamity the most rash, fearless, and desperate creatures, and as there were vast numbers that went about as nurses to tend those that were sick, they committed a great many petty thieveries in the houses where they were employed; and some of them were publicly whipped for it, when perhaps they ought rather to have been hanged for examples, for numbers of houses were robbed on these occasions, till at length the parish officers were sent to recommend nurses to the sick, and always took an account whom it was they sent, so as that they might call them to account if the house had been abused where they were placed.

        But these robberies extended chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen, and what rings or money they could come at when the person died who was under their care, but not to a general plunder of the houses; and I could give you an account of one of these nurses, who, several years after, being on her deathbed, confessed with the utmost horror the robberies she had committed at the time of her being a nurse, and by which she had enriched herself to a great degree. But as for murders, I do not find that there was ever any proof of the facts in the manner as it has been reported, except as above.

        They did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place that laid a wet cloth upon the face of a dying patient whom she tended, and so put an end to his life, who was just expiring before; and another that smothered a young woman she was looking to when she was in a fainting fit, and would have come to herself; some that killed them by giving them one thing, some another, and some starved them by giving them nothing at all. But these stories had two marks of suspicion that always attended them, which caused me always to slight them and to look on them as mere stories that people continually frighted one another with. First, that wherever it was that we heard it, they always placed the scene at the farther end of the town, opposite or most remote from where you were to hear it. If you heard it in Whitechappel, it had happened at St Giles's, or at Westminster, or Holborn, or that end of the town. If you heard of it at that end of the town, then it was done in Whitechappel, or the Minories, or about Cripplegate parish. If you heard of it in the city, why, then it happened in Southwark; and if you heard of it in Southwark, then it was done in the city, and the like.

        In the next place, of what part soever you heard the story, the particulars were always the same, especially that of laying a wet double cloth on a dying man's face, and that of smothering a young gentlewoman; so that it was apparent, at least to my judgement, that there was more of tale than of truth in those things.

        However, I cannot say but it had some effect upon the people, and particularly that, as I said before, they grew more cautious whom they took into their houses, and whom they trusted their lives with, and had them always recommended if they could; and where they could not find such, for they were not very plenty, they applied to the parish officers.

        But here again the misery of that time lay upon the poor who, being infected, had neither food or physic, neither physician or apothecary to assist them, or nurse to attend them. Many of those died calling for help, and even for sustenance, out at their windows in a most miserable and deplorable manner; but it must be added that whenever the cases of such persons or families were represented to my Lord Mayor they always were relieved.

        It is true, in some houses where the people were not very poor, yet where they had sent perhaps their wives and children away, and if they had any servants they had been dismissed;—I say it is true that to save the expenses, many such as these shut themselves in, and not having help, died alone.

        A neighbour and acquaintance of mine, having some money owing to him from a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent his apprentice, a youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavour to get the money. He came to the door, and finding it shut, knocked pretty hard; and, as he thought, heard somebody answer within, but was not sure, so he waited, and after some stay knocked again, and then a third time, when he heard somebody coming downstairs.

        At length the man of the house came to the door; he had on his breeches or drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of slipped-shoes, a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said, 'death in his face'.

        When he opened the door, says he, 'What do you disturb me thus for?' The boy, though a little surprised, replied, 'I come from such a one, and my master sent me for the money which he says you know of.' 'Very well, child,' returns the living ghost; 'call as you go by at Cripplegate Church, and bid them ring the bell'; and with these words shut the door again, and went up again, and died the same day; nay, perhaps the same hour. This the young man told me himself, and I have reason to believe it. This was while the plague was not come to a height. I think it was in June, towards the latter end of the month; it must be before the dead-carts came about, and while they used the ceremony of ringing the bell for the dead, which was over for certain, in that parish at least, before the month of July, for by the 25th of July there died 550 and upwards in a week, and then they could no more bury in form, rich or poor.

        I have mentioned above that notwithstanding this dreadful calamity, yet the numbers of thieves were abroad upon all occasions, where they had found any prey, and that these were generally women. It was one morning about eleven O'clock, I had walked out to my brother's house in Coleman Street parish, as I often did, to see that all was safe.

        My brother's house had a little court before it, and a brick wall and a gate in it, and within that several warehouses where his goods of several sorts lay. It happened that in one of these warehouses were several packs of women's high-crowned hats, which came out of the country and were, as I suppose, for exportation: whither, I know not.

        I was surprised that when I came near my brother's door, which was in a place they called Swan Alley, I met three or four women with high-crowned hats on their heads; and, as I remembered afterwards, one, if not more, had some hats likewise in their hands; but as I did not see them come out at my brother's door, and not knowing that my brother had any such goods in his warehouse, I did not offer to say anything to them, but went across the way to shun meeting them, as was usual to do at that time, for fear of the plague. But when I came nearer to the gate I met another woman with more hats come out of the gate. 'What business, mistress,' said I, 'have you had there?' 'There are more people there,' said she; 'I have had no more business there than they.' I was hasty to get to the gate then, and said no more to her, by which means she got away. But just as I came to the gate, I saw two more coming across the yard to come out with hats also on their heads and under their arms, at which I threw the gate to behind me, which having a spring lock fastened itself; and turning to the women, 'Forsooth,' said I, 'what are you doing here?' and seized upon the hats, and took them from them. One of them, who, I confess, did not look like a thief—'Indeed,' says she, 'we are wrong, but we were told they were goods that had no owner. Be pleased to take them again; and look yonder, there are more such customers as we.' She cried and looked pitifully, so I took the hats from her and opened the gate, and bade them be gone, for I pitied the women indeed; but when I looked towards the warehouse, as she directed, there were six or seven more, all women, fitting themselves with hats as unconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's shop buying for their money.

        I was surprised, not at the sight of so many thieves only, but at the circumstances I was in; being now to thrust myself in among so many people, who for some weeks had been so shy of myself that if I met anybody in the street I would cross the way from them.

        They were equally surprised, though on another account. They all told me they were neighbours, that they had heard anyone might take them, that they were nobody's goods, and the like. I talked big to them at first, went back to the gate and took out the key, so that they were all my prisoners, threatened to lock them all into the warehouse, and go and fetch my Lord Mayor's officers for them.

        They begged heartily, protested they found the gate open, and the warehouse door open; and that it had no doubt been broken open by some who expected to find goods of greater value: which indeed was reasonable to believe, because the lock was broke, and a padlock that hung to the door on the outside also loose, and an abundance of the hats carried away.

        At length I considered that this was not a time to be cruel and rigorous; and besides that, it would necessarily oblige me to go much about, to have several people come to me, and I go to several whose circumstances of health I knew nothing of; and that even at this time the plague was so high as that there died 4000 a week; so that in showing my resentment, or even in seeking justice for my brother's goods, I might lose my own life; so I contented myself with taking the names and places where some of them lived, who were really inhabitants in the neighbourhood, and threatening that my brother should call them to an account for it when he returned to his habitation.

        Then I talked a little upon another foot with them, and asked them how they could do such things as these in a time of such general calamity, and, as it were, in the face of God's most dreadful judgements, when the plague was at their very doors, and, it may be, in their very houses, and they did not know but that the dead-cart might stop at their doors in a few hours to carry them to their graves.

        I could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon them all that while, till it happened that there came two men of the neighbourhood, hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother, for they had been both dependents upon his family, and they came to my assistance. These being, as I said, neighbours, presently knew three of the women and told me who they were and where they lived; and it seems they had given me a true account of themselves before.

        This brings these two men to a further remembrance. The name of one was John Hayward, who was at that time undersexton of the parish of St Stephen, Coleman Street. By undersexton was understood at that time gravedigger and bearer of the dead. This man carried, or assisted to carry, all the dead to their graves which were buried in that large parish, and who were carried in form; and after that form of burying was stopped, went with the dead-cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies from the houses where they lay, and fetched many of them out of the chambers and houses; for the parish was, and is still, remarkable particularly, above all the parishes in London, for a great number of alleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts could come, and where they were obliged to go and fetch the bodies a very long way; which alleys now remain to witness it, such as White's Alley, Cross Key Court, Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and many more. Here they went with a kind of hand-barrow and laid the dead bodies on it, and carried them out to the carts; which work he performed and never had the distemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was sexton of the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time was a nurse to infected people, and tended many that died in the parish, being for her honesty recommended by the parish officers; yet she never was infected neither.

        He never used any preservative against the infection, other than holding garlic and rue in his mouth, and smoking tobacco. This I also had from his own mouth. And his wife's remedy was washing her head in vinegar and sprinkling her head-clothes so with vinegar as to keep them always moist, and if the smell of any of those she waited on was more than ordinary offensive, she snuffed vinegar up her nose and sprinkled vinegar upon her head-clothes, and held a handkerchief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.

        It must be confessed that though the plague was chiefly among the poor, yet were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it, and went about their employment with a sort of brutal courage; I must call it so, for it was founded neither on religion nor prudence; scarce did they use any caution, but ran into any business which they could get employment in, though it was the most hazardous. Such was that of tending the sick, watching houses shut up, carrying infected persons to the pest-house, and, which was still worse, carrying the dead away to their graves.

        It was under this John Hayward's care, and within his bounds, that the story of the piper, with which people have made themselves so merry, happened, and he assured me that it was true. It is said that it was a blind piper; but, as John told me, the fellow was not blind, but an ignorant, weak, poor man, and usually walked his rounds about ten o'clock at night and went piping along from door to door, and the people usually took him in at public-houses where they knew him, and would give him drink and victuals, and sometimes farthings; and he in return would pipe and sing and talk simply, which diverted the people; and thus he lived. It was but a very bad time for this diversion while things were as I have told, yet the poor fellow went about as usual, but was almost starved; and when anybody asked how he did he would answer, the dead cart had not taken him yet, but that they had promised to call for him next week.

        It happened one night that this poor fellow, whether somebody had given him too much drink or no—John Hayward said he had not drink in his house, but that they had given him a little more victuals than ordinary at a public-house in Coleman Street—and the poor fellow, having not usually had a bellyful for perhaps not a good while, was laid all along upon the top of a bulk or stall, and fast asleep, at a door in the street near London Wall, towards Cripplegate-, and that upon the same bulk or stall the people of some house, in the alley of which the house was a corner, hearing a bell which they always rang before the cart came, had laid a body really dead of the plague just by him, thinking, too, that this poor fellow had been a dead body, as the other was, and laid there by some of the neighbours.

        Accordingly, when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came along, finding two dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them up with the instrument they used and threw them into the cart, and, all this while the piper slept soundly.

        From hence they passed along and took in other dead bodies, till, as honest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in the cart; yet all this while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to the place where the bodies were to be thrown into the ground, which, as I do remember, was at Mount Mill; and as the cart usually stopped some time before they were ready to shoot out the melancholy load they had in it, as soon as the cart stopped the fellow awaked and struggled a little to get his head out from among the dead bodies, when, raising himself up in the cart, he called out, 'Hey! where am I?' This frighted the fellow that attended about the work; but after some pause John Hayward, recovering himself, said, 'Lord, bless us! There's somebody in the cart not quite dead!' So another called to him and said, 'Who are you?' The fellow answered, 'I am the poor piper. Where am I?' 'Where are you?' says Hayward. 'Why, you are in the dead-cart, and we are going to bury you.' 'But I an't dead though, am I?' says the piper, which made them laugh a little though, as John said, they were heartily frighted at first; so they helped the poor fellow down, and he went about his business.

        I know the story goes he set up his pipes in the cart and frighted the bearers and others so that they ran away; but John Hayward did not tell the story so, nor say anything of his piping at all; but that he was a poor piper, and that he was carried away as above I am fully satisfied of the truth of.

        It is to be noted here that the dead-carts in the city were not confined to particular parishes, but one cart went through several parishes, according as the number of dead presented; nor were they tied to carry the dead to their respective parishes, but many of the dead taken up in the city were carried to the burying-ground in the out-parts for want of room.

        I have already mentioned the surprise that this judgement was at first among the people. I must be allowed to give some of my observations on the more serious and religious part. Surely never city, at least of this bulk and magnitude, was taken in a condition so perfectly unprepared for such a dreadful visitation, whether I am to speak of the civil preparations or religious. They were, indeed, as if they had had no warning, no expectation, no apprehensions, and consequently the least provision imaginable was made for it in a public way. For example, the Lord Mayor and sheriffs had made no provision as magistrates for the regulations which were to be observed. They had gone into no measures for relief of the poor. The citizens had no public magazines or storehouses for corn or meal for the subsistence of the poor, which if they had provided themselves, as in such cases is done abroad, many miserable families who were now reduced to the utmost distress would have been relieved, and that in a better manner than now could be done.

        The stock of the city's money I can say but little to. The Chamber of London was said to be exceedingly rich, and it may be concluded that they were so, by the vast of money issued from thence in the rebuilding the public edifices after the fire of London, and in building new works, such as, for the first part, the Guildhall, Blackwell Hall, part of Leadenhall, half the Exchange, the Session House, the Compter, the prisons of Ludgate, Newgate, &c., several of the wharfs and stairs and landing-places on the river; all which were either burned down or damaged by the great fire of London, the next year after the plague; and of the second sort, the Monument, Fleet Ditch with its bridges, and the Hospital of Bethlem or Bedlam, &c. But possibly the managers of the city's credit at that time made more conscience of breaking in upon the orphan's money to show charity to the distressed citizens than the managers in the following years did to beautify the city and re-edify the buildings; though, in the first case, the losers would have thought their fortunes better bestowed, and the public faith of the city have been less subjected to scandal and reproach.

        It must be acknowledged that the absent citizens, who, though they were fled for safety into the country, were yet greatly interested in the welfare of those whom they left behind, forgot not to contribute liberally to the relief of the poor, and large sums were also collected among trading towns in the remotest parts of England; and, as I have heard also, the nobility and the gentry in all parts of England took the deplorable condition of the city into their consideration, and sent up large sums of money in charity to the Lord Mayor and magistrates for the relief of the poor. The king also, as I was told, ordered a thousand pounds a week to be distributed in four parts: one quarter to the city and liberty of Westminster; one quarter or part among the inhabitants of the Southwark side of the water; one quarter to the liberty and parts within of the city, exclusive of the city within the walls; and one-fourth part to the suburbs in the county of Middlesex, and the east and north parts of the city. But this latter I only speak of as a report.

        Certain it is, the greatest part of the poor or families who formerly lived by their labour, or by retail trade, lived now on charity; and had there not been prodigious sums of money given by charitable, well-minded Christians for the support of such, the city could never have subsisted. There were, no question, accounts kept of their charity, and of the just distribution of it by the magistrates. But as such multitudes of those very officers died through whose hands it was distributed, and also that, as I have been told, most of the accounts of those things were lost in the great fire which happened in the very next year, and which burnt even the chamberlain's office and many of their papers, so I could never come at the particular account, which I used great endeavours to have seen.

        It may, however, be a direction in case of the approach of a like visitation, which God keep the city from;—I say, it may be of use to observe that by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at that time in distributing weekly great sums of money for relief of the poor, a multitude of people who would otherwise have perished, were relieved, and their lives preserved. And here let me enter into a brief state of the case of the poor at that time, and what way apprehended from them, from whence may be judged hereafter what may be expected if the like distress should come upon the city.

        At the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope but that the whole city would be visited; when, as I have said, all that had friends or estates in the country retired with their families; and when, indeed, one would have thought the very city itself was running out of the gates, and that there would be nobody left behind; you may be sure from that hour all trade, except such as related to immediate subsistence, was, as it were, at a full stop.

        This is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real condition of the people, that I think I cannot be too particular in it, and therefore I descend to the several arrangements or classes of people who fell into immediate distress upon this occasion. For example:

        1. All master-workmen in manufactures, especially such as belonged to ornament and the less necessary parts of the people's dress, clothes, and furniture for houses, such as riband-weavers and other weavers, gold and silver lace makers, and gold and silver wire drawers, sempstresses, milliners, shoemakers, hatmakers, and glovemakers; also upholsterers, joiners, cabinet-makers, looking-glass makers, and innumerable trades which depend upon such as these;—I say, the master-workmen in such stopped their work, dismissed their journeymen and workmen, and all their dependents.

        2. As merchandising was at a full stop, for very few ships ventured to come up the river and none at all went out, so all the extraordinary officers of the customs, likewise the watermen, carmen, porters, and all the poor whose labour depended upon the merchants, were at once dismissed and put out of business.

        3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of houses were at a full stop, for the people were far from wanting to build houses when so many thousand houses were at once stripped of their inhabitants; so that this one article turned all the ordinary workmen of that kind out of business, such as bricklayers, masons, carpenters, joiners, plasterers, painters, glaziers, smiths, plumbers, and all the labourers depending on such.

        4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither coming in or going out as before, so the seamen were all out of employment, and many of them in the last and lowest degree of distress; and with the seamen were all the several tradesmen and workmen belonging to and depending upon the building and fitting out of ships, such as ship-carpenters, caulkers, ropemakers, dry coopers, sailmakers, anchorsmiths, and other smiths; blockmakers, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and the like. The masters of those perhaps might live upon their substance, but the traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all their workmen discharged. Add to these that the river was in a manner without boats, and all or most part of the watermen, lightermen, boat-builders, and lighter-builders in like manner idle and laid by.

        5. All families retrenched their living as much as possible, as well those that fled as those that stayed; so that an innumerable multitude of footmen, serving-men, shopkeepers, journeymen, merchants' bookkeepers, and such sort of people, and especially poor maid-servants, were turned off, and left friendless and helpless, without employment and without habitation, and this was really a dismal article.

        I might be more particular as to this part, but it may suffice to mention in general, all trades being stopped, employment ceased: the labour, and by that the bread, of the poor were cut off; and at first indeed the cries of the poor were most lamentable to hear, though by the distribution of charity their misery that way was greatly abated. Many indeed fled into the counties, but thousands of them having stayed in London till nothing but desperation sent them away, death overtook them on the road, and they served for no better than the messengers of death; indeed, others carrying the infection along with them, spread it very unhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom.

        Many of these were the miserable objects of despair which I have mentioned before, and were removed by the destruction which followed. These might be said to perish not by the infection itself but by the consequence of it; indeed, namely, by hunger and distress and the want of all things: being without lodging, without money, without friends, without means to get their bread, or without anyone to give it them; for many of them were without what we call legal settlements, and so could not claim of the parishes, and all the support they had was by application to the magistrates for relief, which relief was (to give the magistrates their due) carefully and cheerfully administered as they found it necessary, and those that stayed behind never felt the want and distress of that kind which they felt who went away in the manner above noted.

        Let any one who is acquainted with what multitudes of people get their daily bread in this city by their labour, whether artificers or mere workmen—I say, let any man consider what must be the miserable condition of this town if, on a sudden, they should be all turned out of employment, that labour should cease, and wages for work be no more.

        This was the case with us at that time; and had not the sums of money contributed in charity by well-disposed people of every kind, as well abroad as at home, been prodigiously great, it had not been in the power of the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to have kept the public peace. Nor were they without apprehensions, as it was, that desperation should push the people upon tumults, and cause them to rifle the houses of rich men and plunder the markets of provisions; in which case the country people, who brought provisions very freely and boldly to town, would have been terrified from coming any more, and the town would have sunk under an unavoidable famine.

        But the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen within the city, and of the justices of peace in the out-parts, was such, and they were supported with money from all parts so well, that the poor people were kept quiet, and their wants everywhere relieved, as far as was possible to be done.

        Two things besides this contributed to prevent the mob doing any mischief. One was, that really the rich themselves had not laid up stores of provisions in their houses as indeed they ought to have done, and which if they had been wise enough to have done, and locked themselves entirely up, as some few did, they had perhaps escaped the disease better. But as it appeared they had not, so the mob had no notion of finding stores of provisions there if they had broken in as it is plain they were sometimes very near doing, and which: if they had, they had finished the ruin of the whole city, for there were no regular troops to have withstood them, nor could the trained bands have been brought together to defend the city, no men being to be found to bear arms.

        But the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such magistrates as could be had (for some, even of the aldermen, were dead, and some absent) prevented this; and they did it by the most kind and gentle methods they could think of, as particularly by relieving the most desperate with money, and putting others into business, and particularly that employment of watching houses that were infected and shut up. And as the number of these were very great (for it was said there was at one time ten thousand houses shut up, and every house had two watchmen to guard it, viz., one by night and the other by day), this gave opportunity to employ a very great number of poor men at a time.

        The women and servants that were turned off from their places were likewise employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places, and this took off a very great number of them.

        And, which though a melancholy article in itself, yet was a deliverance in its kind: namely, the plague, which raged in a dreadful manner from the middle of August to the middle of October, carried off in that time thirty or forty thousand of these very people which, had they been left, would certainly have been an insufferable burden by their poverty; that is to say, the whole city could not have supported the expense of them, or have provided food for them; and they would in time have been even driven to the necessity of plundering either the city itself or the country adjacent, to have subsisted themselves, which would first or last have put the whole nation, as well as the city, into the utmost terror and confusion.

        It was observable, then, that this calamity of the people made them very humble; for now for about nine weeks together there died near a thousand a day, one day with another, even by the account of the weekly bills, which yet, I have reason to be assured, never gave a full account, by many thousands; the confusion being such, and the carts working in the dark when they carried the dead, that in some places no account at all was kept, but they worked on, the clerks and sextons not attending for weeks together, and not knowing what number they carried. This account is verified by the following bills of mortality:—

        So that the gross of the people were carried off in these two months; for, as the whole number which was brought in to die of the plague was but 68,590, here is 50,000 of them, within a trifle, in two months; I say 50,000, because, as there wants 295 in the number above, so there wants two days of two months in the account of time.

        Now when I say that the parish officers did not give in a full account, or were not to be depended upon for their account, let any one but consider how men could be exact in such a time of dreadful distress, and when many of them were taken sick themselves and perhaps died in the very time when their accounts were to be given in; I mean the parish clerks, besides inferior officers; for though these poor men ventured at all hazards, yet they were far from being exempt from the common calamity, especially if it be true that the parish of Stepney had, within the year, 116 sextons, gravediggers, and their assistants; that is to say, bearers, bellmen, and drivers of carts for carrying off the dead bodies.

        Indeed the work was not of a nature to allow them leisure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all huddled together in the dark into a pit; which pit or trench no man could come nigh but at the utmost peril. I observed often that in the parishes of Aldgate and Cripplegate, Whitechappel and Stepney, there were five, six, seven, and eight hundred in a week in the bills; whereas if we may believe the opinion of those that lived in the city all the time as well as I, there died sometimes 2000 a week in those parishes; and I saw it under the hand of one that made as strict an examination into that part as he could, that there really died an hundred thousand people of the plague in that one year whereas in the bills, the articles of the plague, it was but 68,590.

        If I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what I saw with my eyes and heard from other people that were eye-witnesses, I do verily believe the same, viz., that there died at least 100,000 of the plague only, besides other distempers and besides those which died in the fields and highways and secret Places out of the compass of the communication, as it was called, and who were not put down in the bills though they really belonged to the body of the inhabitants. It was known to us all that abundance of poor despairing creatures who had the distemper upon them, and were grown stupid or melancholy by their misery, as many were, wandered away into the fields and Woods, and into secret uncouth places almost anywhere, to creep into a bush or hedge and die.

        The inhabitants of the villages adjacent would, in pity, carry them food and set it at a distance, that they might fetch it, if they were able; and sometimes they were not able, and the next time they went they should find the poor wretches lie dead and the food untouched. The number of these miserable objects were many, and I know so many that perished thus, and so exactly where, that I believe I could go to the very place and dig their bones up still; for the country people would go and dig a hole at a distance from them, and then with long poles, and hooks at the end of them, drag the bodies into these pits, and then throw the earth in from as far as they could cast it, to cover them, taking notice how the wind blew, and so coming on that side which the seamen call to windward, that the scent of the bodies might blow from them; and thus great numbers went out of the world who were never known, or any account of them taken, as well within the bills of mortality as without.

        This, indeed, I had in the main only from the relation of others, for I seldom walked into the fields, except towards Bethnal Green and Hackney, or as hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a great many poor wanderers at a distance; but I could know little of their cases, for whether it were in the street or in the fields, if we had seen anybody coming, it was a general method to walk away; yet I believe the account is exactly true.

        As this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and fields, I cannot omit taking notice what a desolate place the city was at that time. The great street I lived in (which is known to be one of the broadest of all the streets of London, I mean of the suburbs as well as the liberties) all the side where the butchers lived, especially without the bars, was more like a green field than a paved street, and the people generally went in the middle with the horses and carts. It is true that the farthest end towards Whitechappel Church was not all paved, but even the part that was paved was full of grass also; but this need not seem strange, since the great streets within the city, such as Leadenhall Street, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill, and even the Exchange itself, had grass growing in them in several places; neither cart or coach were seen in the streets from morning to evening, except some country carts to bring roots and beans, or peas, hay, and straw, to the market, and those but very few compared to what was usual. As for coaches, they were scarce used but to carry sick people to the pest-house, and to other hospitals, and some few to carry physicians to such places as they thought fit to venture to visit; for really coaches were dangerous things, and people did not care to venture into them, because they did not know who might have been carried in them last, and sick, infected people were, as I have said, ordinarily carried in them to the pest-houses, and sometimes people expired in them as they went along.

        It is true, when the infection came to such a height as I have now mentioned, there were very few physicians which cared to stir abroad to sick houses, and very many of the most eminent of the faculty were dead, as well as the surgeons also; for now it was indeed a dismal time, and for about a month together, not taking any notice of the bills of mortality, I believe there did not die less than 1500 or 1700 a day, one day with another.

        One of the worst days we had in the whole time, as I thought, was in the beginning of September, when, indeed, good people began to think that God was resolved to make a full end of the people in this miserable city. This was at that time when the plague was fully come into the eastern parishes. The parish of Aldgate, if I may give my opinion, buried above a thousand a week for two weeks, though the bills did not say so many;—but it surrounded me at so dismal a rate that there was not a house in twenty uninfected in the Minories, in Houndsditch, and in those parts of Aldgate parish about the Butcher Row and the alleys over against me. I say, in those places death reigned in every corner. Whitechappel parish was in the same condition, and though much less than the parish I lived in, yet buried near 600 a week by the bills, and in my opinion near twice as many. Whole families, and indeed whole streets of families, were swept away together; insomuch that it was frequent for neighbours to call to the bellman to go to such-and-such houses and fetch out the people, for that they were all dead.

        And, indeed, the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was now grown so very odious and dangerous that it was complained of that the bearers did not take care to clear such houses where all the inhabitants were dead, but that sometimes the bodies lay several days unburied, till the neighbouring families were offended with the stench, and consequently infected; and this neglect of the officers was such that the churchwardens and constables were summoned to look after it, and even the justices of the Hamlets were obliged to venture their lives among them to quicken and encourage them, for innumerable of the bearers died of the distemper, infected by the bodies they were obliged to come so near. And had it not been that the number of poor people who wanted employment and wanted bread (as I have said before) was so great that necessity drove them to undertake anything and venture anything, they would never have found people to be employed. And then the bodies of the dead would have lain above ground, and have perished and rotted in a dreadful manner.

        But the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this, that they kept such good order for the burying of the dead, that as fast as any of these they employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or died, as was many times the case, they immediately supplied the places with others, which, by reason of the great number of poor that was left out of business, as above, was not hard to do. This occasioned, that notwithstanding the infinite number of people which died and were sick, almost all together, yet they were always cleared away and carried off every night, so that it was never to be said of London that the living were not able to bury the dead.

        As the desolation was greater during those terrible times, so the amazement of the people increased, and a thousand unaccountable things they would do in the violence of their fright, as others did the same in the agonies of their distemper, and this part was very affecting. Some went roaring and crying and wringing their hands along the street; some would go praying and lifting up their hands to heaven, calling upon God for mercy. I cannot say, indeed, whether this was not in their distraction, but, be it so, it was still an indication of a more serious mind, when they had the use of their senses, and was much better, even as it was, than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day, and especially in the evenings, were heard in some streets. I suppose the world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast. He, though not infected at all but in his head, went about denouncing of judgement upon the city in a frightful manner, sometimes quite naked, and with a pan of burning charcoal on his head. What he said, or pretended, indeed I could not learn.

        I will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not, or whether he did it in pure zeal for the poor people, who went every evening through the streets of Whitechappel, and, with his hands lifted up, repeated that part of the Liturgy of the Church continually, 'Spare us, good Lord; spare Thy people, whom Thou has redeemed with Thy most precious blood.' I say, I cannot speak positively of these things, because these were only the dismal objects which represented themselves to me as I looked through my chamber windows (for I seldom opened the casements), while I confined myself within doors during that most violent raging of the pestilence; when, indeed, as I have said, many began to think, and even to say, that there would none escape; and indeed I began to think so too, and therefore kept within doors for about a fortnight and never stirred out. But I could not hold it. Besides, there were some people who, notwithstanding the danger, did not omit publicly to attend the worship of God, even in the most dangerous times; and though it is true that a great many clergymen did shut up their churches, and fled, as other people did, for the safety of their lives, yet all did not do so. Some ventured to officiate and to keep up the assemblies of the people by constant prayers, and sometimes sermons or brief exhortations to repentance and reformation, and this as long as any would come to hear them. And Dissenters did the like also, and even in the very churches where the parish ministers were either dead or fled; nor was there any room for making difference at such a time as this was.

        It was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the miserable lamentations of poor dying creatures calling out for ministers to comfort them and pray with them, to counsel them and to direct them, calling out to God for pardon and mercy, and confessing aloud their past sins. It would make the stoutest heart bleed to hear how many warnings were then given by dying penitents to others not to put off and delay their repentance to the day of distress; that such a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance, was no time to call upon God. I wish I could repeat the very sound of those groans and of those exclamations that I heard from some poor dying creatures when in the height of their agonies and distress, and that I could make him that reads this hear, as I imagine I now hear them, for the sound seems still to ring in my ears.

        If I could but tell this part in such moving accents as should alarm the very soul of the reader, I should rejoice that I recorded those things, however short and imperfect.

        It pleased God that I was still spared, and very hearty and sound in health, but very impatient of being pent up within doors without air, as I had been for fourteen days or thereabouts; and I could not restrain myself, but I would go to carry a letter for my brother to the post-house. Then it was indeed that I observed a profound silence in the streets. When I came to the post-house, as I went to put in my letter I saw a man stand in one corner of the yard and talking to another at a window, and a third had opened a door belonging to the office. In the middle of the yard lay a small leather purse with two keys hanging at it, with money in it, but nobody would meddle with it. I asked how long it had lain there; the man at the window said it had lain almost an hour, but that they had not meddled with it, because they did not know but the person who dropped it might come back to look for it. I had no such need of money, nor was the sum so big that I had any inclination to meddle with it, or to get the money at the hazard it might be attended with; so I seemed to go away, when the man who had opened the door said he would take it up, but so that if the right owner came for it he should be sure to have it. So he went in and fetched a pail of water and set it down hard by the purse, then went again and fetch some gunpowder, and cast a good deal of powder upon the purse, and then made a train from that which he had thrown loose upon the purse. The train reached about two yards. After this he goes in a third time and fetches out a pair of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I suppose, on purpose; and first setting fire to the train of powder, that singed the purse and also smoked the air sufficiently. But he was not content with that, but he then takes up the purse with the tongs, holding it so long till the tongs burnt through the purse, and then he shook the money out into the pail of water, so he carried it in. The money, as I remember, was about thirteen shilling and some smooth groats and brass farthings.

        There might perhaps have been several poor people, as I have observed above, that would have been hardy enough to have ventured for the sake of the money; but you may easily see by what I have observed that the few people who were spared were very careful of themselves at that time when the distress was so exceeding great.

        Much about the same time I walked out into the fields towards Bow; for I had a great mind to see how things were managed in the river and among the ships; and as I had some concern in shipping, I had a notion that it had been one of the best ways of securing one's self from the infection to have retired into a ship; and musing how to satisfy my curiosity in that point, I turned away over the fields from Bow to Bromley, and down to Blackwall to the stairs which are there for landing or taking water.

        Here I saw a poor man walking on the bank, or sea-wall, as they call it, by himself. I walked a while also about, seeing the houses all shut up. At last I fell into some talk, at a distance, with this poor man; first I asked him how people did thereabouts. 'Alas, sir!' says he, 'almost desolate; all dead or sick. Here are very few families in this part, or in that village' (pointing at Poplar), 'where half of them are not dead already, and the rest sick.' Then he pointing to one house, 'There they are all dead', said he, 'and the house stands open; nobody dares go into it. A poor thief', says he, 'ventured in to steal something, but he paid dear for his theft, for he was carried to the churchyard too last night.' Then he pointed to several other houses. 'There', says he, 'they are all dead, the man and his wife, and five children. There', says he, 'they are shut up; you see a watchman at the door'; and so of other houses. 'Why,' says I, 'what do you here all alone?' 'Why,' says he, 'I am a poor, desolate man; it has pleased God I am not yet visited, though my family is, and one of my children dead.' 'How do you mean, then,' said I, 'that you are not visited?' 'Why,' says he, 'that's my house' (pointing to a very little, low-boarded house), 'and there my poor wife and two children live,' said he, 'if they may be said to live, for my wife and one of the children are visited, but I do not come at them.' And with that word I saw the tears run very plentifully down his face; and so they did down mine too, I assure you.

        'But,' said I, 'why do you not come at them? How can you abandon your own flesh and blood?' 'Oh, sir,' says he, 'the Lord forbid! I do not abandon them; I work for them as much as I am able; and, blessed be the Lord, I keep them from want'; and with that I observed he lifted up his eyes to heaven, with a countenance that presently told me I had happened on a man that was no hypocrite, but a serious, religious, good man, and his ejaculation was an expression of thankfulness that, in such a condition as he was in, he should be able to say his family did not want. 'Well,' says I, 'honest man, that is a great mercy as things go now with the poor. But how do you live, then, and how are you kept from the dreadful calamity that is now upon us all?' 'Why, sir,' says he, 'I am a waterman, and there's my boat,' says he, 'and the boat serves me for a house. I work in it in the day, and I sleep in it in the night; and what I get I lay down upon that stone,' says he, showing me a broad stone on the other side of the street, a good way from his house; 'and then,' says he, 'I halloo, and call to them till I make them hear; and they come and fetch it.'

        'Well, friend,' says I, 'but how can you get any money as a waterman? Does any body go by water these times?' 'Yes, sir,' says he, 'in the way I am employed there does. Do you see there,' says he, 'five ships lie at anchor' (pointing down the river a good way below the town), 'and do you see', says he, 'eight or ten ships lie at the chain there, and at anchor yonder?' (pointing above the town). 'All those ships have families on board, of their merchants and owners, and such-like, who have locked themselves up and live on board, close shut in, for fear of the infection; and I tend on them to fetch things for them, carry letters, and do what is absolutely necessary, that they may not be obliged to come on shore; and every night I fasten my boat on board one of the ship's boats, and there I sleep by myself, and, blessed be God, I am preserved hitherto.'

        'Well,' said I, 'friend, but will they let you come on board after you have been on shore here, when this is such a terrible place, and so infected as it is?'

        'Why, as to that,' said he, 'I very seldom go up the ship-side, but deliver what I bring to their boat, or lie by the side, and they hoist it on board. If I did, I think they are in no danger from me, for I never go into any house on shore, or touch anybody, no, not of my own family; but I fetch provisions for them.'

        'Nay,' says I, 'but that may be worse, for you must have those provisions of somebody or other; and since all this part of the town is so infected, it is dangerous so much as to speak with anybody, for the village', said I, 'is, as it were, the beginning of London, though it be at some distance from it.'

        'That is true,' added he; 'but you do not understand me right; I do not buy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat there, and sometimes I row down the river to Woolwich and buy there; then I go to single farm-houses on the Kentish side, where I am known, and buy fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships, as they direct me, sometimes one, sometimes the other. I seldom come on shore here, and I came now only to call on my wife and hear how my family do, and give them a little money, which I received last night.'

        'Poor man!' said I; 'and how much hast thou gotten for them?'

        'I have gotten four shillings,' said he, 'which is a great sum, as things go now with poor men; but they have given me a bag of bread too, and a salt fish and some flesh; so all helps out.' 'Well,' said I, 'and have you given it them yet?'

        'No,' said he; 'but I have called, and my wife has answered that she cannot come out yet, but in half-an-hour she hopes to come, and I am waiting for her. Poor woman!' says he, 'she is brought sadly down. She has a swelling, and it is broke, and I hope she will recover; but I fear the child will die, but it is the Lord—'

        Here he stopped, and wept very much.

        'Well, honest friend,' said I, 'thou hast a sure Comforter, if thou hast brought thyself to be resigned to the will of God; He is dealing with us all in judgement.'

        'Oh, sir!' says he, 'it is infinite mercy if any of us are spared, and who am I to repine!'

        'Sayest thou so?' said I, 'and how much less is my faith than thine?' And here my heart smote me, suggesting how much better this poor man's foundation was on which he stayed in the danger than mine; that he had nowhere to fly; that he had a family to bind him to attendance, which I had not; and mine was mere presumption, his a true dependence and a courage resting on God; and yet that he used all possible caution for his safety.

        I turned a little way from the man while these thoughts engaged me, for, indeed, I could no more refrain from tears than he.

        At length, after some further talk, the poor woman opened the door and called, 'Robert, Robert'. He answered, and bid her stay a few moments and he would come; so he ran down the common stairs to his boat and fetched up a sack, in which was the provisions he had brought from the ships; and when he returned he hallooed again. Then he went to the great stone which he showed me and emptied the sack, and laid all out, everything by themselves, and then retired; and his wife came with a little boy to fetch them away, and called and said such a captain had sent such a thing, and such a captain such a thing, and at the end adds, 'God has sent it all; give thanks to Him.' When the poor woman had taken up all, she was so weak she could not carry it at once in, though the weight was not much neither; so she left the biscuit, which was in a little bag, and left a little boy to watch it till she came again.

        'Well, but', says I to him, 'did you leave her the four shillings too, which you said was your week's pay?'

        'Yes, yes,' says he; 'you shall hear her own it.' So he calls again, 'Rachel, Rachel,' which it seems was her name, 'did you take up the money?' 'Yes,' said she. 'How much was it?' said he. 'Four shillings and a groat,' said she. 'Well, well,' says he, 'the Lord keep you all'; and so he turned to go away.

        As I could not refrain contributing tears to this man's story, so neither could I refrain my charity for his assistance. So I called him, 'Hark thee, friend,' said I, 'come hither, for I believe thou art in health, that I may venture thee'; so I pulled out my hand, which was in my pocket before, 'Here,' says I, 'go and call thy Rachel once more, and give her a little more comfort from me. God will never forsake a family that trust in Him as thou dost.' So I gave him four other shillings, and bid him go lay them on the stone and call his wife.

        I have not words to express the poor man's thankfulness, neither could he express it himself but by tears running down his face. He called his wife, and told her God had moved the heart of a stranger, upon hearing their condition, to give them all that money, and a great deal more such as that he said to her. The woman, too, made signs of the like thankfulness, as well to Heaven as to me, and joyfully picked it up; and I parted with no money all that year that I thought better bestowed.

        I then asked the poor man if the distemper had not reached to Greenwich. He said it had not till about a fortnight before; but that then he feared it had, but that it was only at that end of the town which lay south towards Deptford Bridge; that he went only to a butcher's shop and a grocer's, where he generally bought such things as they sent him for, but was very careful.

        I asked him then how it came to pass that those people who had so shut themselves up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores of all things necessary. He said some of them had—but, on the other hand, some did not come on board till they were frighted into it and till it was too dangerous for them to go to the proper people to lay in quantities of things, and that he waited on two ships, which he showed me, that had laid in little or nothing but biscuit bread and ship beer, and that he had bought everything else almost for them. I asked him if there was any more ships that had separated themselves as those had done. He told me yes, all the way up from the point, right against Greenwich, to within the shore of Limehouse and Redriff, all the ships that could have room rid two and two in the middle of the stream, and that some of them had several families on board. I asked him if the distemper had not reached them. He said he believed it had not, except two or three ships whose people had not been so watchful to keep the seamen from going on shore as others had been, and he said it was a very fine sight to see how the ships lay up the Pool.

        When he said he was going over to Greenwich as soon as the tide began to come in, I asked if he would let me go with him and bring me back, for that I had a great mind to see how the ships were ranged, as he had told me. He told me, if I would assure him on the word of a Christian and of an honest man that I had not the distemper, he would. I assured him that I had not; that it had pleased God to preserve me; that I lived in Whitechappel, but was too impatient of being so long within doors, and that I had ventured out so far for the refreshment of a little air, but that none in my house had so much as been touched with it.

        Well, sir,' says he, 'as your charity has been moved to pity me and my poor family, sure you cannot have so little pity left as to put yourself into my boat if you were not sound in health which would be nothing less than killing me and ruining my whole family.' The poor man troubled me so much when he spoke of his family with such a sensible concern and in such an affectionate manner, that I could not satisfy myself at first to go at all. I told him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than make him uneasy, though I was sure, and very thankful for it, that I had no more distemper upon me than the freshest man in the world. Well, he would not have me put it off neither, but to let me see how confident he was that I was just to him, now importuned me to go; so when the tide came up to his boat I went in, and he carried me to Greenwich. While he bought the things which he had in his charge to buy, I walked up to the top of the hill under which the town stands, and on the east side of the town, to get a prospect of the river. But it was a surprising sight to see the number of ships which lay in rows, two and two, and some places two or three such lines in the breadth of the river, and this not only up quite to the town, between the houses which we call Ratcliff and Redriff, which they name the Pool, but even down the whole river as far as the head of Long Reach, which is as far as the hills give us leave to see it.

        I cannot guess at the number of ships, but I think there must be several hundreds of sail; and I could not but applaud the contrivance: for ten thousand people and more who attended ship affairs were certainly sheltered here from the violence of the contagion, and lived very safe and very easy.

        I returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied with my day's journey, and particularly with the poor man; also I rejoiced to see that such little sanctuaries were provided for so many families in a time of such desolation. I observed also that, as the violence of the plague had increased, so the ships which had families on board removed and went farther off, till, as I was told, some went quite away to sea, and put into such harbours and safe roads on the north coast as they could best come at.

        But it was also true that all the people who thus left the land and lived on board the ships were not entirely safe from the infection, for many died and were thrown overboard into the river, some in coffins, and some, as I heard, without coffins, whose bodies were seen sometimes to drive up and down with the tide in the river.

        But I believe I may venture to say that in those ships which were thus infected it either happened where the people had recourse to them too late, and did not fly to the ship till they had stayed too long on shore and had the distemper upon them (though perhaps they might not perceive it) and so the distemper did not come to them on board the ships, but they really carried it with them; or it was in these ships where the poor waterman said they had not had time to furnish themselves with provisions, but were obliged to send often on shore to buy what they had occasion for, or suffered boats to come to them from the shore. And so the distemper was brought insensibly among them.

        And here I cannot but take notice that the strange temper of the people of London at that time contributed extremely to their own destruction. The plague began, as I have observed, at the other end of the town, namely, in Long Acre, Drury Lane, &c., and came on towards the city very gradually and slowly. It was felt at first in December, then again in February, then again in April, and always but a very little at a time; then it stopped till May, and even the last week in May there was but seventeen, and all at that end of the town; and all this while, even so long as till there died above 3000 a week, yet had the people in Redriff, and in Wapping and Ratcliff, on both sides of the river, and almost all Southwark side, a mighty fancy that they should not be visited, or at least that it would not be so violent among them. Some people fancied the smell of the pitch and tar, and such other things as oil and rosin and brimstone, which is so much used by all trades relating to shipping, would preserve them. Others argued it, because it was in its extreamest violence in Westminster and the parish of St Giles and St Andrew, &c., and began to abate again before it came among them—which was true indeed, in part. For example—

From the 8th to the 15th August—
- St Giles-in-the-Fields                           242

- Rotherhith                                             2
- Total this week                                  5319

        N.B.—That it was observed the numbers mentioned in Stepney parish at that time were generally all on that side where Stepney parish joined to Shoreditch, which we now call Spittlefields, where the parish of Stepney comes up to the very wall of Shoreditch Churchyard, and the plague at this time was abated at St Giles-in-the-Fields, and raged most violently in Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch parishes; but there was not ten people a week that died of it in all that part of Stepney parish which takes in Limehouse, Ratdiff Highway, and which are now the parishes of Shadwell and Wapping, even to St Katherine's by the Tower, till after the whole month of August was expired. But they paid for it afterwards, as I shall observe by-and-by.

        This, I say, made the people of Redriff and Wapping, Ratcliff and Limehouse, so secure, and flatter themselves so much with the plague's going off without reaching them, that they took no care either to fly into the country or shut themselves up. Nay, so far were they from stirring that they rather received their friends and relations from the city into their houses, and several from other places really took sanctuary in that part of the town as a Place of safety, and as a place which they thought God would pass over, and not visit as the rest was visited.

        And this was the reason that when it came upon—them they were more surprised, more unprovided, and more at a loss what to do than they were in other places; for when it came among them really and with violence, as it did indeed in September and October, there was then no stirring out into the country, nobody would suffer a stranger to come near them, no, nor near the towns where they dwelt; and, as I have been told, several that wandered into the country on Surrey side were found starved to death in the woods and commons, that country being more open and more woody than any other part so near London, especially about Norwood and the parishes of Camberwell, Dullege, and Lusum, where, it seems, nobody durst relieve the poor distressed people for fear of the infection.

        This notion having, as I said, prevailed with the people in that part of the town, was in part the occasion, as I said before, that they had recourse to ships for their retreat; and where they did this early and with prudence, furnishing themselves so with provisions that they had no need to go on shore for supplies or suffer boats to come on board to bring them,—I say, where they did so they had certainly the safest retreat of any people whatsoever; but the distress was such that people ran on board, in their fright, without bread to eat, and some into ships that had no men on board to remove them farther off, or to take the boat and go down the river to buy provisions where it might be done safely, and these often suffered and were infected on board as much as on shore.

        As the richer sort got into ships, so the lower rank got into hoys, smacks, lighters, and fishing-boats; and many, especially watermen, lay in their boats; but those made sad work of it, especially the latter, for, going about for provision, and perhaps to get their subsistence, the infection got in among them and made a fearful havoc; many of the watermen died alone in their wherries as they rid at their roads, as well as above bridge as below, and were not found sometimes till they were not in condition for anybody to touch or come near them.

        Indeed, the distress of the people at this seafaring end of the town was very deplorable, and deserved the greatest commiseration. But, alas, this was a time when every one's private safety lay so near them that they had no room to pity the distresses of others; for every one had death, as it were, at his door, and many even in their families, and knew not what to do or whither to fly.

        This, I say, took away all compassion; self-preservation, indeed, appeared here to be the first law. For the children ran away from their parents as they languished in the utmost distress. And in some places, though not so frequent as the other, parents did the like to their children; nay, some dreadful examples there were, and particularly two in one week, of distressed mothers, raving and distracted, killing their own children; one whereof was not far off from where I dwelt, the poor lunatic creature not living herself long enough to be sensible of the sin of what she had done, much less to be punished for it.

        It is not, indeed, to be wondered at: for the danger of immediate death to ourselves took away all bowels of love, all concern for one another. I speak in general, for there were many instances of immovable affection, pity, and duty in many, and some that came to my knowledge, that is to say, by hearsay; for I shall not take upon me to vouch the truth of the particulars.

        To introduce one, let me first mention that one of the most deplorable cases in all the present calamity was that of women with child, who, when they came to the hour of their sorrows, and their pains come upon them, could neither have help of one kind or another; neither midwife or neighbouring women to come near them. Most of the midwives were dead, especially of such as served the poor; and many, if not all the midwives of note, were fled into the country; so that it was next to impossible for a poor woman that could not pay an immoderate price to get any midwife to come to her—and if they did, those they could get were generally unskilful and ignorant creatures; and the consequence of this was that a most unusual and incredible number of women were reduced to the utmost distress. Some were delivered and spoiled by the rashness and ignorance of those who pretended to lay them. Children without number were, I might say, murdered by the same but a more justifiable ignorance: pretending they would save the mother, whatever became of the child; and many times both mother and child were lost in the same manner; and especially where the mother had the distemper, there nobody would come near them and both sometimes perished. Sometimes the mother has died of the plague, and the infant, it may be, half born, or born but not parted from the mother. Some died in the very pains of their travail, and not delivered at all; and so many were the cases of this kind that it is hard to judge of them.

        Something of it will appear in the unusual numbers which are put into the weekly bills (though I am far from allowing them to be able to give anything of a full account) under the articles of—

Child-bed.
Abortive and Still-born.
Christmas and Infants.

        Take the weeks in which the plague was most violent, and compare them with the weeks before the distemper began, even in the same year. For example:—

        To the disparity of these numbers it is to be considered and allowed for, that according to our usual opinion who were then upon the spot, there were not one-third of the people in the town during the months of August and September as were in the months of January and February. In a word, the usual number that used to die of these three articles, and, as I hear, did die of them the year before, was thus:—

1664. 1665.
Child-bed 189 Child-bed 625
Abortive and still-born 458 Abortive and still-born 617
- —— ——
- 647 12421664.                                                   1665.

-                                    647                                             1242

        This inequality, I say, is exceedingly augmented when the numbers of people are considered. I pretend not to make any exact calculation of the numbers of people which were at this time in the city, but I shall make a probable conjecture at that part by-and-by. What I have said now is to explain the misery of those poor creatures above; so that it might well be said, as in the Scripture, Woe be to those who are with child, and to those which give suck in that day. For, indeed, it was a woe to them in particular.

        I was not conversant in many particular families where these things happened, but the outcries of the miserable were heard afar off. As to those who were with child, we have seen some calculation made; 291 women dead in child-bed in nine weeks, out of one-third part of the number of whom there usually died in that time but eighty-four of the same disaster. Let the reader calculate the proportion.

        There is no room to doubt but the misery of those that gave suck was in proportion as great. Our bills of mortality could give but little light in this, yet some it did. There were several more than usual starved at nurse, but this was nothing. The misery was where they were, first, starved for want of a nurse, the mother dying and all the family and the infants found dead by them, merely for want; and, if I may speak my opinion, I do believe that many hundreds of poor helpless infants perished in this manner. Secondly, not starved, but poisoned by the nurse. Nay, even where the mother has been nurse, and having received the infection, has poisoned, that is, infected the infant with her milk even before they knew they were infected themselves; nay, and the infant has died in such a case before the mother. I cannot but remember to leave this admonition upon record, if ever such another dreadful visitation should happen in this city, that all women that are with child or that give suck should be gone, if they have any possible means, out of the place, because their misery, if infected, will so much exceed all other people's.

        I could tell here dismal stories of living infants being found sucking the breasts of their mothers, or nurses, after they have been dead of the plague. Of a mother in the parish where I lived, who, having a child that was not well, sent for an apothecary to view the child; and when he came, as the relation goes, was giving the child suck at her breast, and to all appearance was herself very well; but when the apothecary came close to her he saw the tokens upon that breast with which she was suckling the child. He was surprised enough, to be sure, but, not willing to fright the poor woman too much, he desired she would give the child into his hand; so he takes the child, and going to a cradle in the room, lays it in, and opening its cloths, found the tokens upon the child too, and both died before he could get home to send a preventive medicine to the father of the child, to whom he had told their condition. Whether the child infected the nurse-mother or the mother the child was not certain, but the last most likely. Likewise of a child brought home to the parents from a nurse that had died of the plague, yet the tender mother would not refuse to take in her child, and laid it in her bosom, by which she was infected; and died with the child in her arms dead also.

        It would make the hardest heart move at the instances that were frequently found of tender mothers tending and watching with their dear children, and even dying before them, and sometimes taking the distemper from them and dying, when the child for whom the affectionate heart had been sacrificed has got over it and escaped.

        The like of a tradesman in East Smithfield, whose wife was big with child of her first child, and fell in labour, having the plague upon her. He could neither get midwife to assist her or nurse to tend her, and two servants which he kept fled both from her. He ran from house to house like one distracted, but could get no help; the utmost he could get was, that a watchman, who attended at an infected house shut up, promised to send a nurse in the morning. The poor man, with his heart broke, went back, assisted his wife what he could, acted the part of the midwife, brought the child dead into the world, and his wife in about an hour died in his arms, where he held her dead body fast till the morning, when the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had promised; and coming up the stairs (for he had left the door open, or only latched), they found the man sitting with his dead wife in his arms, and so overwhelmed with grief that he died in a few hours after without any sign of the infection upon him, but merely sunk under the weight of his grief.

        I have heard also of some who, on the death of their relations, have grown stupid with the insupportable sorrow; and of one, in particular, who was so absolutely overcome with the pressure upon his spirits that by degrees his head sank into his body, so between his shoulders that the crown of his head was very little seen above the bone of his shoulders; and by degrees losing both voice and sense, his face, looking forward, lay against his collarbone and could not be kept up any otherwise, unless held up by the hands of other people; and the poor man never came to himself again, but languished near a year in that condition, and died. Nor was he ever once seen to lift up his eyes or to look upon any particular object.

        I cannot undertake to give any other than a summary of such passages as these, because it was not possible to come at the particulars, where sometimes the whole families where such things happened were carried off by the distemper. But there were innumerable cases of this kind which presented to the eye and the ear, even in passing along the streets, as I have hinted above. Nor is it easy to give any story of this or that family which there was not divers parallel stories to be met with of the same kind.

        But as I am now talking of the time when the plague raged at the easternmost part of the town—how for a long time the people of those parts had flattered themselves that they should escape, and how they were surprised when it came upon them as it did; for, indeed, it came upon them like an armed man when it did come;—I say, this brings me back to the three poor men who wandered from Wapping, not knowing whither to go or what to do, and whom I mentioned before; one a biscuit-baker, one a sailmaker, and the other a joiner, all of Wapping, or there-abouts.

        The sleepiness and security of that part, as I have observed, was such that they not only did not shift for themselves as others did, but they boasted of being safe, and of safety being with them; and many people fled out of the city, and out of the infected suburbs, to Wapping, Ratcliff, Limehouse, Poplar, and such Places, as to Places of security; and it is not at all unlikely that their doing this helped to bring the plague that way faster than it might otherwise have come. For though I am much for people flying away and emptying such a town as this upon the first appearance of a like visitation, and that all people who have any possible retreat should make use of it in time and be gone, yet I must say, when all that will fly are gone, those that are left and must stand it should stand stock-still where they are, and not shift from one end of the town or one part of the town to the other; for that is the bane and mischief of the whole, and they carry the plague from house to house in their very clothes.

        Wherefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats, but because as they were domestic animals, and are apt to run from house to house and from street to street, so they are capable of carrying the effluvia or infectious streams of bodies infected even in their furs and hair? And therefore it was that, in the beginning of the infection, an order was published by the Lord Mayor, and by the magistrates, according to the advice of the physicians, that all the dogs and cats should be immediately killed, and an officer was appointed for the execution.

        It is incredible, if their account is to be depended upon, what a prodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked of forty thousand dogs, and five times as many cats; few houses being without a cat, some having several, sometimes five or six in a house. All possible endeavours were used also to destroy the mice and rats, especially the latter, by laying ratsbane and other poisons for them, and a prodigious multitude of them were also destroyed.

        I often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of the people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them, and how it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as well public as private, that all the confusions that followed were brought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sank in that disaster, which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence concurring, have been avoided, and which, if posterity think fit, they may take a caution and warning from. But I shall come to this part again.

        I come back to my three men. Their story has a moral in every part of it, and their whole conduct, and that of some whom they joined with, is a pattern for all poor men to follow, or women either, if ever such a time comes again; and if there was no other end in recording it, I think this a very just one, whether my account be exactly according to fact or no.

        Two of them are said to be brothers, the one an old soldier, but now a biscuit-maker; the other a lame sailor, but now a sailmaker; the third a joiner. Says John the biscuit-maker one day to Thomas his brother, the sailmaker, 'Brother Tom, what will become of us? The plague grows hot in the city, and increases this way. What shall we do?'

        'Truly,' says Thomas, 'I am at a great loss what to do, for I find if it comes down into Wapping I shall be turned out of my lodging.' And thus they began to talk of it beforehand.

        John. Turned out of your lodging, Tom I If you are, I don't know who will take you in; for people are so afraid of one another now, there's no getting a lodging anywhere.

        Thomas. Why, the people where I lodge are good, civil people, and have kindness enough for me too; but they say I go abroad every day to my work, and it will be dangerous; and they talk of locking themselves up and letting nobody come near them.

        John. Why, they are in the right, to be sure, if they resolve to venture staying in town.

        Thomas. Nay, I might even resolve to stay within doors too, for, except a suit of sails that my master has in hand, and which I am just finishing, I am like to get no more work a great while. There's no trade stirs now. Workmen and servants are turned off everywhere, so that I might be glad to be locked up too; but I do not see they will be willing to consent to that, any more than to the other.

        John. Why, what will you do then, brother? And what shall I do? for I am almost as bad as you. The people where I lodge are all gone into the country but a maid, and she is to go next week, and to shut the house quite up, so that I shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you, and I am resolved to go away too, if I knew but where to go.

        Thomas. We were both distracted we did not go away at first; then we might have travelled anywhere. There's no stirring now; we shall be starved if we pretend to go out of town. They won't let us have victuals, no, not for our money, nor let us come into the towns, much less into their houses.

        John. And that which is almost as bad, I have but little money to help myself with neither.

        Thomas. As to that, we might make shift, I have a little, though not much; but I tell you there's no stirring on the road. I know a couple of poor honest men in our street have attempted to travel, and at Barnet, or Whetstone, or thereabouts, the people offered to fire at them if they pretended to go forward, so they are come back again quite discouraged.

        John. I would have ventured their fire if I had been there. If I had been denied food for my money they should have seen me take it before their faces, and if I had tendered money for it they could not have taken any course with me by law.

        Thomas. You talk your old soldier's language, as if you were in the Low Countries now, but this is a serious thing. The people have good reason to keep anybody off that they are not satisfied are sound, at such a time as this, and we must not plunder them.

        John. No, brother, you mistake the case, and mistake me too. I would plunder nobody; but for any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass through the town in the open highway, and deny me provisions for my money, is to say the town has a right to starve me to death, which cannot be true.

        Thomas. But they do not deny you liberty to go back again from whence you came, and therefore they do not starve you.

        John. But the next town behind me will, by the same rule, deny me leave to go back, and so they do starve me between them. Besides, there is no law to prohibit my travelling wherever I will on the road.

        Thomas. But there will be so much difficulty in disputing with them at every town on the road that it is not for poor men to do it or undertake it, at such a time as this is especially.

        John. Why, brother, our condition at this rate is worse than anybody else's, for we can neither go away nor stay here. I am of the same mind with the lepers of Samaria: 'If we stay here we are sure to die', I mean especially as you and I are stated, without a dwelling-house of our own, and without lodging in anybody else's. There is no lying in the street at such a time as this; we had as good go into the dead-cart at once. Therefore I say, if we stay here we are sure to die, and if we go away we can but die; I am resolved to be gone.

        Thomas. You will go away. Whither will you go, and what can you do? I would as willingly go away as you, if I knew whither. But we have no acquaintance, no friends. Here we were born, and here we must die.

        John. Look you, Tom, the whole kingdom is my native country as well as this town. You may as well say I must not go out of my house if it is on fire as that I must not go out of the town I was born in when it is infected with the plague. I was born in England, and have a right to live in it if I can.

        Thomas. But you know every vagrant person may by the laws of England be taken up, and passed back to their last legal settlement.

        John. But how shall they make me vagrant? I desire only to travel on, upon my lawful occasions.

        Thomas. What lawful occasions can we pretend to travel, or rather wander upon? They will not be put off with words.

        John. Is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion? And do they not all know that the fact is true? We cannot be said to dissemble.

        Thomas. But suppose they let us pass, whither shall we go?

        John. Anywhere, to save our lives; it is time enough to consider that when we are got out of this town. If I am once out of this dreadful place, I care not where I go.

        Thomas. We shall be driven to great extremities. I know not what to think of it.

        John. Well, Tom, consider of it a little.

        This was about the beginning of July; and though the plague was come forward in the west and north parts of the town, yet all Wapping, as I have observed before, and Redriff, and Ratdiff, and Limehouse, and Poplar, in short, Deptford and Greenwich, all both sides of the river from the Hermitage, and from over against it, quite down to Blackwall, was entirely free; there had not one person died of the plague in all Stepney parish, and not one on the south side of Whitechappel Road, no, not in any parish; and yet the weekly bill was that very week risen up to 1006.

        It was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again, and then the case was a little altered, and the' plague was exceedingly advanced and the number greatly increased; the bill was up at 2785, and prodigiously increasing, though still both sides of the river, as below, kept pretty well. But some began to die in Redriff, and about five or six in Ratdiff Highway, when the sailmaker came to his brother John express, and in some fright; for he was absolutely warned out of his lodging, and had only a week to provide himself. His brother John was in as bad a case, for he was quite out, and had only begged leave of his master, the biscuit-maker, to lodge in an outhouse belonging to his workhouse, where he only lay upon straw, with some biscuit-sacks, or bread-sacks, as they called them, laid upon it, and some of the same sacks to cover him.

        Here they resolved (seeing all employment being at an end, and no work or wages to be had), they would make the best of their way to get out of the reach of the dreadful infection, and, being as good husbands as they could, would endeavour to live upon what they had as long as it would last, and then work for more if they could get work anywhere, of any kind, let it be what it would.

        While they were considering to put this resolution in practice in the best manner they could, the third man, who was acquainted very well with the sailmaker, came to know of the design, and got leave to be one of the number; and thus they prepared to set out.

        It happened that they had not an equal share of money; but as the sailmaker, who had the best stock, was, besides his being lame, the most unfit to expect to get anything by working in the country, so he was content that what money they had should all go into one public stock, on condition that whatever any one of them could gain more than another, it should without any grudging be all added to the public stock.

        They resolved to load themselves with as little baggage as possible because they resolved at first to travel on foot, and to go a great way that they might, if possible, be effectually safe; and a great many consultations they had with themselves before they could agree about what way they should travel, which they were so far from adjusting that even to the morning they set out they were not resolved on it.

        At last the seaman put in a hint that determined it. 'First,' says he, 'the weather is very hot, and therefore I am for travelling north, that we may not have the sun upon our faces and beating on our breasts, which will heat and suffocate us; and I have been told', says he, 'that it is not good to overheat our blood at a time when, for aught we know, the infection may be in the very air. In the next place,' says he, 'I am for going the way that may be contrary to the wind, as it may blow when we set out, that we may not have the wind blow the air of the city on our backs as we go.' These two cautions were approved of, if it could be brought so to hit that the wind might not be in the south when they set out to go north.

        John the baker, who had been a soldier, then put in his opinion. 'First,' says he, 'we none of us expect to get any lodging on the road, and it will be a little too hard to lie just in the open air. Though it be warm weather, yet it may be wet and damp, and we have a double reason to take care of our healths at such a time as this; and therefore,' says he, 'you, brother Tom, that are a sailmaker, might easily make us a little tent, and I will undertake to set it up every night, and take it down, and a fig for all the inns in England; if we have a good tent over our heads we shall do well enough.'

        The joiner opposed this, and told them, let them leave that to him; he would undertake to build them a house every night with his hatchet and mallet, though he had no other tools, which should be fully to their satisfaction, and as good as a tent.

        The soldier and the joiner disputed that point some time, but at last the soldier carried it for a tent. The only objection against it was, that it must be carried with them, and that would increase their baggage too much, the weather being hot; but the sailmaker had a piece of good hap, fell in which made that easy, for his master whom he worked for, having a rope-walk as well as sailmaking trade, had a little, poor horse that he made no use of then; and being willing to assist the three honest men, he gave them the horse for the carrying their baggage; also for a small matter of three days' work that his man did for him before he went, he let him have an old top-gallant sail that was worn out, but was sufficient and more than enough to make a very good tent. The soldier showed how to shape it, and they soon by his direction made their tent, and fitted it with poles or staves for the purpose; and thus they were furnished for their journey, viz., three men, one tent, one horse, one gun—for the soldier would not go without arms, for now he said he was no more a biscuit-baker, but a trooper.

        The joiner had a small bag of tools such as might be useful if he should get any work abroad, as well for their subsistence as his own. What money they had they brought all into one public stock, and thus they began their journey. It seems that in the morning when they set out the wind blew, as the sailor said, by his pocket-compass, at N.W. by W. So they directed, or rather resolved to direct, their course N.W.

        But then a difficulty came in their way, that, as they set out from the hither end of Wapping, near the Hermitage, and that the plague was now very violent, especially on the north side of the city, as in Shoreditch and Cripplegate parish, they did not think it safe for them to go near those parts; so they went away east through Ratcliff Highway as far as Ratcliff Cross, and leaving Stepney Church still on their left hand, being afraid to come up from Ratcliff Cross to Mile End, because they must come just by the churchyard, and because the wind, that seemed to blow more from the west, blew directly from the side of the city where the plague was hottest. So, I say, leaving Stepney they fetched a long compass, and going to Poplar and Bromley, came into the great road just at Bow.

        Here the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would have questioned them, but they, crossing the road into a narrow way that turns out of the hither end of the town of Bow to Old Ford, avoided any inquiry there, and travelled to Old Ford. The constables everywhere were upon their guard not so much, It seems, to stop people passing by as to stop them from taking up their abode in their towns, and withal because of a report that was newly raised at that time: and that, indeed, was not very improbable, viz., that the poor people in London, being distressed and starved for want of work, and by that means for want of bread, were up in arms and had raised a tumult, and that they would come out to all the towns round to plunder for bread. This, I say, was only a rumour, and it was very well it was no more. But it was not so far off from being a reality as it has been thought, for in a few weeks more the poor people became so desperate by the calamity they suffered that they were with great difficulty kept from going out into the fields and towns, and tearing all in pieces wherever they came; and, as I have observed before, nothing hindered them but that the plague raged so violently and fell in upon them so furiously that they rather went to the grave by thousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands; for, in the parts about the parishes of St Sepulcher, Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, which were the places where the mob began to threaten, the distemper came on so furiously that there died in those few parishes even then, before the plague was come to its height, no less than 5361 people in the first three weeks in August; when at the same time the parts about Wapping, Radcliffe, and Rotherhith were, as before described, hardly touched, or but very lightly; so that in a word though, as I said before, the good management of the Lord Mayor and justices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the people from breaking out in rabbles and tumults, and in short from the poor plundering the rich,—I say, though they did much, the dead-carts did more: for as I have said that in five parishes only there died above 5000 in twenty days, so there might be probably three times that number sick all that time; for some recovered, and great numbers fell sick every day and died afterwards. Besides, I must still be allowed to say that if the bills of mortality said five thousand, I always believed it was near twice as many in reality, there being no room to believe that the account they gave was right, or that indeed they were among such confusions as I saw them in, in any condition to keep an exact account.

        But to return to my travellers. Here they were only examined, and as they seemed rather coming from the country than from the city, they found the people the easier with them; that they talked to them, let them come into a public-house where the constable and his warders were, and gave them drink and some victuals which greatly refreshed and encouraged them; and here it came into their heads to say, when they should be inquired of afterwards, not that they came from London, but that they came out of Essex.

        To forward this little fraud, they obtained so much favour of the constable at Old Ford as to give them a certificate of their passing from Essex through that village, and that they had not been at London; which, though false in the common acceptance of London in the county, yet was literally true, Wapping or Ratcliff being no part either of the city or liberty.

        This certificate directed to the next constable that was at Homerton, one of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney, was so serviceable to them that it procured them, not a free passage there only, but a full certificate of health from a justice of the peace, who upon the constable's application granted it without much difficulty; and thus they passed through the long divided town of Hackney (for it lay then in several separated hamlets), and travelled on till they came into the great north road on the top of Stamford Hill.

        By this time they began to be weary, and so in the back-road from Hackney, a little before it opened into the said great road, they resolved to set up their tent and encamp for the first night, which they did accordingly, with this addition, that finding a barn, or a building like a barn, and first searching as well as they could to be sure there was nobody in it, they set up their tent, with the head of it against the barn. This they did also because the wind blew that night very high, and they were but young at such a way of lodging, as well as at the managing their tent.

        Here they went to sleep; but the joiner, a grave and sober man, and not pleased with their lying at this loose rate the first night, could not sleep, and resolved, after trying to sleep to no purpose, that he would get out, and, taking the gun in his hand, stand sentinel and guard his companions. So with the gun in his hand, he walked to and again before the barn, for that stood in the field near the road, but within the hedge. He had not been long upon the scout but he heard a noise of people coming on, as if it had been a great number, and they came on, as he thought, directly towards the barn. He did not presently awake his companions; but in a few minutes more, their noise growing louder and louder, the biscuit-baker called to him and asked him what was the matter, and quickly started out too. The other, being the lame sailmaker and most weary, lay still in the tent.

        As they expected, so the people whom they had heard came on directly to the barn, when one of our travellers challenged, like soldiers upon the guard, with 'Who comes there?' The people did not answer immediately, but one of them speaking to another that was behind him, 'Alas I alas I we are all disappointed,' says he. 'Here are some people before us; the barn is taken up.'

        They all stopped upon that, as under some surprise, and it seems there was about thirteen of them in all, and some women among them. They consulted together what they should do, and by their discourse our travellers soon found they were poor, distressed people too, like themselves, seeking shelter and safety; and besides, our travellers had no need to be afraid of their coming up to disturb them, for as soon as they heard the words, 'Who comes there?' these could hear the women say, as if frighted, 'Do not go near them. How do you know but they may have the plague?' And when one of the men said, 'Let us but speak to them', the women said, 'No, don't by any means. We have escaped thus far by the goodness of God; do not let us run into danger now, we beseech you.'

        Our travellers found by this that they were a good, sober sort of people, and flying for their lives, as they were; and, as they were encouraged by it, so John said to the joiner, his comrade, 'Let us encourage them too as much as we can'; so he called to them, 'Hark ye, good people,' says the joiner, 'we find by your talk that you are flying from the same dreadful enemy as we are. Do not be afraid of us; we are only three poor men of us. If you are free from the distemper you shall not be hurt by us. We are not in the barn, but in a little tent here in the outside, and we will remove for you; we can set up our tent again immediately anywhere else'; and upon this a parley began between the joiner, whose name was Richard, and one of their men, who said his name was Ford.

        Ford. And do you assure us that you are all sound men?

        Richard. Nay, we are concerned to tell you of it, that you may not be uneasy or think yourselves in danger; but you see we do not desire you should put yourselves into any danger, and therefore I tell you that we have not made use of the barn, so we will remove from it, that you may be safe and we also.

        Ford. That is very kind and charitable; but if we have reason to be satisfied that you are sound and free from the visitation, why should we make you remove now you are settled in your lodging, and, it may be, are laid down to rest? We will go into the barn, if you please, to rest ourselves a while, and we need not disturb you.

        Richard. Well, but you are more than we are. I hope you will assure us that you are all of you sound too, for the danger is as great from you to us as from us to you.

        Ford. Blessed be God that some do escape, though it is but few; what may be our portion still we know not, but hitherto we are preserved.

        Richard. What part of the town do you come from? Was the plague come to the places where you lived?

        Ford. Ay, ay, in a most frightful and terrible manner, or else we had not fled away as we do; but we believe there will be very few left alive behind us.

        Richard. What part do you come from?

        Ford. We are most of us of Cripplegate parish, only two or three of Clerkenwell parish, but on the hither side.

        Richard. How then was it that you came away no sooner?

        Ford. We have been away some time, and kept together as well as we could at the hither end of Islington, where we got leave to lie in an old uninhabited house, and had some bedding and conveniences of our own that we brought with us; but the plague is come up into Islington too, and a house next door to our poor dwelling was infected and shut up; and we are come away in a fright.

        Richard. And what way are you going?

        Ford. As our lot shall cast us; we know not whither, but God will guide those that look up to Him.

        They parleyed no further at that time, but came all up to the barn, and with some difficulty got into it. There was nothing but hay in the barn, but it was almost full of that, and they accommodated themselves as well as they could, and went to rest; but our travellers observed that before they went to sleep an ancient man who it seems was father of one of the women, went to prayer with all the company, recommending themselves to the blessing and direction of Providence, before they went to sleep.

        It was soon day at that time of the year, and as Richard the joiner had kept guard the first part of the night, so John the soldier relieved him, and he had the post in the morning, and they began to be acquainted with one another. It seems when they left Islington they intended to have gone north, away to Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, and there they would not let them pass; so they crossed over the fields and hills to the eastward, and came out at the Boarded River, and so avoiding the towns, they left Hornsey on the left hand and Newington on the right hand, and came into the great road about Stamford Hill on that side, as the three travellers had done on the other side. And now they had thoughts of going over the river in the marshes, and make forwards to Epping Forest, where they hoped they should get leave to rest. It seems they were not poor, at least not so poor as to be in want; at least they had enough to subsist them moderately for two or three months, when, as they said, they were in hopes the cold weather would check the infection, or at least the violence of it would have spent itself, and would abate, if it were only for want of people left alive to be infected.

        This was much the fate of our three travellers, only that they seemed to be the better furnished for travelling, and had it in their view to go farther off; for as to the first, they did not propose to go farther than one day's journey, that so they might have intelligence every two or three days how things were at London.

        But here our travellers found themselves under an unexpected inconvenience: namely that of their horse, for by means of the horse to carry their baggage they were obliged to keep in the road, whereas the people of this other band went over the fields or roads, path or no path, way or no way, as they pleased; neither had they any occasion to pass through any town, or come near any town, other than to buy such things as they wanted for their necessary subsistence, and in that indeed they were put to much difficulty; of which in its place.

        But our three travellers were obliged to keep the road, or else they must commit spoil, and do the country a great deal of damage in breaking down fences and gates to go over enclosed fields, which they were loth to do if they could help it.

        Our three travellers, however, had a great mind to join themselves to this company and take their lot with them; and after some discourse they laid aside their first design which looked northward, and resolved to follow the other into Essex; so in the morning they took up their tent and loaded their horse, and away they travelled all together.

        They had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the river-side, the ferryman being afraid of them; but after some parley at a distance, the ferryman was content to bring his boat to a place distant from the usual ferry, and leave it there for them to take it; so putting themselves over, he directed them to leave the boat, and he, having another boat, said he would fetch it again, which it seems, however, he did not do for above eight days.

        Here, giving the ferryman money beforehand, they had a supply of victuals and drink, which he brought and left in the boat for them; but not without, as I said, having received the money beforehand. But now our travellers were at a great loss and difficulty how to get the horse over, the boat being small and not fit for it: and at last could not do it without unloading the baggage and making him swim over.

        From the river they travelled towards the forest, but when they came to Walthamstow the people of that town denied to admit them, as was the case everywhere. The constables and their watchmen kept them off at a distance and parleyed with them. They gave the same account of themselves as before, but these gave no credit to what they said, giving it for a reason that two or three companies had already come that way and made the like pretences, but that they had given several people the distemper in the towns where they had passed; and had been afterwards so hardly used by the country (though with justice, too, as they had deserved) that about Brentwood, or that way, several of them perished in the fields—whether of the plague or of mere want and distress they could not tell.

        This was a good reason indeed why the people of Walthamstow should be very cautious, and why they should resolve not to entertain anybody that they were not well satisfied of. But, as Richard the joiner and one of the other men who parleyed with them told them, it was no reason why they should block up the roads and refuse to let people pass through the town, and who asked nothing of them but to go through the street; that if their people were afraid of them, they might go into their houses and shut their doors; they would neither show them civility nor incivility, but go on about their business.

        The constables and attendants, not to be persuaded by reason, continued obstinate, and would hearken to nothing; so the two men that talked with them went back to their fellows to consult what was to be done. It was very discouraging in the whole, and they knew not what to do for a good while; but at last John the soldier and biscuit-maker, considering a while, 'Come,' says he, 'leave the rest of the parley to me.' He had not appeared yet, so he sets the joiner, Richard, to work to cut some poles out of the trees and shape them as like guns as he could, and in a little time he had five or six fair muskets, which at a distance would not be known; and about the part where the lock of a gun is he caused them to wrap cloth and rags such as they had, as soldiers do in wet weather to preserve the locks of their pieces from rust; the rest was discoloured with clay or mud, such as they could get; and all this while the rest of them sat under the trees by his direction, in two or three bodies, where they made fires at a good distance from one another.

        While this was doing he advanced himself and two or three with him, and set up their tent in the lane within sight of the barrier which the town's men had made, and set a sentinel just by it with the real gun, the only one they had, and who walked to and fro with the gun on his shoulder, so as that the people of the town might see them. Also, he tied the horse to a gate in the hedge just by, and got some dry sticks together and kindled a fire on the other side of the tent, so that the people of the town could see the fire and the smoke, but could not see what they were doing at it.

        After the country people had looked upon them very earnestly a great while, and, by all that they could see, could not but suppose that they were a great many in company, they began to be uneasy, not for their going away, but for staying where they were; and above all, perceiving they had horses and arms, for they had seen one horse and one gun at the tent, and they had seen others of them walk about the field on the inside of the hedge by the side of the lane with their muskets, as they took them to be, shouldered; I say, upon such a sight as this, you may be assured they were alarmed and terribly frighted, and it seems they went to a justice of the peace to know what they should do. What the justice advised them to I know not, but towards the evening they called from the barrier, as above, to the sentinel at the tent.

        'What do you want?' says John.*

        'Why, what do you intend to do?' says the constable. 'To do,' says John; 'what would you have us to do?' Constable. Why don't you be gone? What do you stay there for?

        John. Why do you stop us on the king's highway, and pretend to refuse us leave to go on our way?

        Constable. We are not bound to tell you our reason, though we did let you know it was because of the plague.

        John. We told you we were all sound and free from the plague, which we were not bound to have satisfied you of, and yet you pretend to stop us on the highway.

        Constable. We have a right to stop it up, and our own safety obliges us to it. Besides, this is not the king's highway; 'tis a way upon sufferance. You see here is a gate, and if we do let people pass here, we make them pay toll.

        John. We have a right to seek our own safety as well as you, and you may see we are flying for our lives: and 'tis very unchristian and unjust to stop us.

        Constable. You may go back from whence you came; we do not hinder you from that.

John. No; it is a stronger enemy than you that keeps us from doing that, or else we should not have come hither.

        Constable. Well, you may go any other way, then.

        John. No, no; I suppose you see we are able to send you going, and all the people of your parish, and come through your town when we will; but since you have stopped us here, we are content. You see we have encamped here, and here we will live. We hope you will furnish us with victuals.

                 *It seems John was in the tent, but hearing them call, he
                 steps out, and taking the gun upon his shoulder, talked to
                 them as if he had been the sentinel placed there upon the
                 guard by some officer that was his superior. [Footnote in
                 the original.]

        Constable. We furnish you? What mean you by that?

        John. Why, you would not have us starve, would you? If you stop us here, you must keep us.

        Constable. You will be ill kept at our maintenance.

        John. If you stint us, we shall make ourselves the better allowance.

        Constable. Why, you will not pretend to quarter upon us by force, will you?

        John. We have offered no violence to you yet. Why do you seem to oblige us to it? I am an old soldier, and cannot starve, and if you think that we shall be obliged to go back for want of provisions, you are mistaken.

        Constable. Since you threaten us, we shall take care to be strong enough for you. I have orders to raise the county upon you.

        John. It is you that threaten, not we. And since you are for mischief, you cannot blame us if we do not give you time for it; we shall begin our march in a few minutes.*

        Constable. What is it you demand of us?

        John. At first we desired nothing of you but leave to go through the town; we should have offered no injury to any of you, neither would you have had any injury or loss by us. We are not thieves, but poor people in distress, and flying from the dreadful plague in London, which devours thousands every week. We wonder how you could be so unmerciful!

        Constable. Self-preservation obliges us.

        John. What! To shut up your compassion in a case of such distress as this?

        Constable. Well, if you will pass over the fields on your left hand, and behind that part of the town, I will endeavour to have gates opened for you.

        John. Our horsemen ** cannot pass with our baggage that way; it does not lead into the road that we want to go, and why should you force us out of the road? Besides, you have kept us here all day without any provisions but such as we brought with us. I think you ought to send us some provisions for our relief.

                 * This frighted the constable and the people that were with
                 him, that they immediately changed their note.

                 ** They had but one horse among them.
                  [Footnotes in the original.]

        Constable. If you will go another way we will send you some provisions.

        John. That is the way to have all the towns in the county stop up the ways against us.

        Constable. If they all furnish you with food, what will you be the worse? I see you have tents; you want no lodging.

        John. Well, what quantity of provisions will you send us?

        Constable. How many are you?

        John. Nay, we do not ask enough for all our company; we are in three companies. If you will send us bread for twenty men and about six or seven women for three days, and show us the way over the field you speak of, we desire not to put your people into any fear for us; we will go out of our way to oblige you, though we are as free from infection as you are.*

        Constable. And will you assure us that your other people shall offer us no new disturbance?

        John. No, no you may depend on it.

        Constable. You must oblige yourself, too, that none of your people shall come a step nearer than where the provisions we send you shall be set down.

        John. I answer for it we will not.

        Accordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of bread and three or four large pieces of good beef, and opened some gates, through which they passed; but none of them had courage so much as to look out to see them go, and, as it was evening, if they had looked they could not have seen them as to know how few they were.

        This was John the soldier's management. But this gave such an alarm to the county, that had they really been two or three hundred the whole county would have been raised upon them, and they would have been sent to prison, or perhaps knocked on the head.

                * Here he called to one of his men, and bade him order
                 Captain Richard and his people to march the lower way on the
                 side of the marches, and meet them in the forest; which was
                 all a sham, for they had no Captain Richard, or any such
                 company. [Footnote in the original.]

        They were soon made sensible of this, for two days afterwards they found several parties of horsemen and footmen also about, in pursuit of three companies of men, armed, as they said, with muskets, who were broke out from London and had the plague upon them, and that were not only spreading the distemper among the people, but plundering the country.

        As they saw now the consequence of their case, they soon saw the danger they were in; so they resolved by the advice also of the old soldier to divide themselves again. John and his two comrades, with the horse, went away, as if towards Waltham; the other in two companies, but all a little asunder, and went towards Epping.

        The first night they encamped all in the forest, and not far off of one another, but not setting up the tent, lest that should discover them. On the other hand, Richard went to work with his axe and his hatchet, and cutting down branches of trees, he built three tents or hovels, in which they all encamped with as much convenience as they could expect.

        The provisions they had at Walthamstow served them very plentifully this night; and as for the next, they left it to Providence. They had fared so well with the old soldier's conduct that they now willingly made him their leader, and the first of his conduct appeared to be very good. He told them that they were now at a proper distance enough from London; that as they need not be immediately beholden to the country for relief, so they ought to be as careful the country did not infect them as that they did not infect the country; that what little money they had, they must be as frugal of as they could; that as he would not have them think of offering the country any violence, so they must endeavour to make the sense of their condition go as far with the country as it could. They all referred themselves to his direction, so they left their three houses standing, and the next day went away towards Epping. The captain also (for so they now called him), and his two fellow-travellers, laid aside their design of going to Waltham, and all went together.

        When they came near Epping they halted, choosing out a proper place in the open forest, not very near the highway, but not far out of it on the north side, under a little cluster of low pollard-trees. Here they pitched their little camp—which consisted of three large tents or huts made of poles which their carpenter, and such as were his assistants, cut down and fixed in the ground in a circle, binding all the small ends together at the top and thickening the sides with boughs of trees and bushes, so that they were completely close and warm. They had, besides this, a little tent where the women lay by themselves, and a hut to put the horse in.

        It happened that the next day, or next but one, was market-day at Epping, when Captain John and one of the other men went to market and bought some provisions; that is to say, bread, and some mutton and beef; and two of the women went separately, as if they had not belonged to the rest, and bought more. John took the horse to bring it home, and the sack which the carpenter carried his tools in, to put it in. The carpenter went to work and made them benches and stools to sit on, such as the wood he could get would afford, and a kind of table to dine on.

        They were taken no notice of for two or three days, but after that abundance of people ran out of the town to look at them, and all the country was alarmed about them. The people at first seemed afraid to come near them; and, on the other hand, they desired the people to keep off, for there was a rumour that the plague was at Waltham, and that it had been in Epping two or three days; so John called out to them not to come to them, 'for,' says he, 'we are all whole and sound people here, and we would not have you bring the plague among us, nor pretend we brought it among you.'

        After this the parish officers came up to them and parleyed with them at a distance, and desired to know who they were, and by what authority they pretended to fix their stand at that place. John answered very frankly, they were poor distressed people from London who, foreseeing the misery they should be reduced to if plague spread into the city, had fled out in time for their lives, and, having no acquaintance or relations to fly to, had first taken up at Islington; but, the plague being come into that town, were fled farther; and as they supposed that the people of Epping might have refused them coming into their town, they had pitched their tents thus in the open field and in the forest, being willing to bear all the hardships of such a disconsolate lodging rather than have any one think or be afraid that they should receive injury by them.

        At first the Epping people talked roughly to them, and told them they must remove; that this was no place for them; and that they pretended to be sound and well, but that they might be infected with the plague for aught they knew, and might infect the whole country, and they could not suffer them there.

        John argued very calmly with them a great while, and told them that London was the place by which they—that is, the townsmen of Epping and all the country round them—subsisted; to whom they sold the produce of their lands, and out of whom they made their rent of their farms; and to be so cruel to the inhabitants of London, or to any of those by whom they gained so much, was very hard, and they would be loth to have it remembered hereafter, and have it told how barbarous, how inhospitable, and how unkind they were to the people of London when they fled from the face of the most terrible enemy in the world; that it would be enough to make the name of an Epping man hateful through all the city, and to have the rabble stone them in the very streets whenever they came so much as to market; that they were not yet secure from being visited themselves, and that, as he heard, Waltham was already; that they would think it very hard that when any of them fled for fear before they were touched, they should be denied the liberty of lying so much as in the open fields.

        The Epping men told them again, that they, indeed, said they were sound and free from the infection, but that they had no assurance of it; and that it was reported that there had been a great rabble of people at Walthamstow, who made such pretences of being sound as they did, but that they threatened to plunder the town and force their way, whether the parish officers would or no; that there were near two hundred of them, and had arms and tents like Low Country soldiers; that they extorted provisions from the town, by threatening them with living upon them at free quarter, showing their arms, and talking in the language of soldiers; and that several of them being gone away toward Rumford and Brentwood, the country had been infected by them, and the plague spread into both those large towns, so that the people durst not go to market there as usual; that it was very likely they were some of that party; and if so, they deserved to be sent to the county jail, and be secured till they had made satisfaction for the damage they had done, and for the terror and fright they had put the country into.

        John answered that what other people had done was nothing to them; that they assured them they were all of one company; that they had never been more in number than they saw them at that time (which, by the way, was very true); that they came out in two separate companies, but joined by the way, their cases being the same; that they were ready to give what account of themselves anybody could desire of them, and to give in their names and places of abode, that so they might be called to an account for any disorder that they might be guilty of; that the townsmen might see they were content to live hardly, and only desired a little room to breathe in on the forest where it was wholesome; for where it was not they could not stay, and would decamp if they found it otherwise there.

        'But,' said the townsmen, 'we have a great charge of poor upon our hands already, and we must take care not to increase it; we suppose you can give us no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to the inhabitants, any more than you can of being dangerous to us as to the infection.'

        'Why, look you,' says John, 'as to being chargeable to you, we hope we shall not. If you will relieve us with provisions for our present necessity, we will be very thankful; as we all lived without charity when we were at home, so we will oblige ourselves fully to repay you, if God pleases to bring us back to our own families and houses in safety, and to restore health to the people of London.

        'As to our dying here: we assure you, if any of us die, we that survive will bury them, and put you to no expense, except it should be that we should all die; and then, indeed, the last man not being able to bury himself, would put you to that single expense which I am persuaded', says John, 'he would leave enough behind him to pay you for the expense of.

        'On the other hand,' says John, 'if you shut up all bowels of compassion, and not relieve us at all, we shall not extort anything by violence or steal from any one; but when what little we have is spent, if we perish for want, God's will be done.'

        John wrought so upon the townsmen, by talking thus rationally and smoothly to them, that they went away; and though they did not give any consent to their staying there, yet they did not molest them; and the poor people continued there three or four days longer without any disturbance. In this time they had got some remote acquaintance with a victualling-house at the outskirts of the town, to whom they called at a distance to bring some little things that they wanted, and which they caused to be set down at a distance, and always paid for very honestly.

        During this time the younger people of the town came frequently pretty near them, and would stand and look at them, and sometimes talk with them at some space between; and particularly it was observed that the first Sabbath-day the poor people kept retired, worshipped God together, and were heard to sing psalms.

        These things, and a quiet, inoffensive behaviour, began to get them the good opinion of the country, and people began to pity them and speak very well of them; the consequence of which was, that upon the occasion of a very wet, rainy night, a certain gentleman who lived in the neighbourhood sent them a little cart with twelve trusses or bundles of straw, as well for them to lodge upon as to cover and thatch their huts and to keep them dry. The minister of a parish not far off, not knowing of the other, sent them also about two bushels of wheat and half a bushel of white peas.

        They were very thankful, to be sure, for this relief, and particularly the straw was a—very great comfort to them; for though the ingenious carpenter had made frames for them to lie in like troughs, and filled them with leaves of trees, and such things as they could get, and had cut all their tent-cloth out to make them coverlids, yet they lay damp and hard and unwholesome till this straw came, which was to them like feather-beds, and, as John said, more welcome than feather-beds would have been at another time.

        This gentleman and the minister having thus begun, and given an example of charity to these wanderers, others quickly followed, and they received every day some benevolence or other from the people, but chiefly from the gentlemen who dwelt in the country round them. Some sent them chairs, stools, tables, and such household things as they gave notice they wanted; some sent them blankets, rugs, and coverlids, some earthenware, and some kitchen ware for ordering their food.

        Encouraged by this good usage, their carpenter in a few days built them a large shed or house with rafters, and a roof in form, and an upper floor, in which they lodged warm: for the weather began to be damp and cold in the beginning of September. But this house, being well thatched, and the sides and roof made very thick, kept out the cold well enough. He made, also, an earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it, and another of the company, with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a funnel to the chimney to carry out the smoke.

        Here they lived comfortably, though coarsely, till the beginning of September, when they had the bad news to hear, whether true or not, that the plague, which was very hot at Waltham Abbey on one side and at Rumford and Brentwood on the other side, was also coming to Epping, to Woodford, and to most of the towns upon the Forest, and which, as they said, was brought down among them chiefly by the higlers, and such people as went to and from London with provisions.

        If this was true, it was an evident contradiction to that report which was afterwards spread all over England, but which, as I have said, I cannot confirm of my own knowledge: namely, that the market-people carrying provisions to the city never got the infection or carried it back into the country; both which, I have been assured, has been false.

        It might be that they were preserved even beyond expectation, though not to a miracle, that abundance went and came and were not touched; and that was much for the encouragement of the poor people of London, who had been completely miserable if the people that brought provisions to the markets had not been many times wonderfully preserved, or at least more preserved than could be reasonably expected.

        But now these new inmates began to be disturbed more effectually, for the towns about them were really infected, and they began to be afraid to trust one another so much as to go abroad for such things as they wanted, and this pinched them very hard, for now they had little or nothing but what the charitable gentlemen of the country supplied them with. But, for their encouragement, it happened that other gentlemen in the country who had not sent them anything before, began to hear of them and supply them, and one sent them a large pig—that is to say, a porker—another two sheep, and another sent them a calf. In short, they had meat enough, and sometimes had cheese and milk, and all such things. They were chiefly put to it for bread, for when the gentlemen sent them corn they had nowhere to bake it or to grind it. This made them eat the first two bushel of wheat that was sent them in parched corn, as the Israelites of old did, without grinding or making bread of it.

        At last they found means to carry their corn to a windmill near Woodford, where they had it ground,         and afterwards the biscuit-maker made a hearth so hollow and dry that he could bake biscuit-cakes tolerably well; and thus they came into a condition to live without any assistance or supplies from the towns; and it was well they did, for the country was soon after fully infected, and about 120 were said to have died of the distemper in the villages near them, which was a terrible thing to them.

        On this they called a new council, and now the towns had no need to be afraid they should settle near them; but, on the contrary, several families of the poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted their houses and built huts in the forest after the same manner as they had done. But it was observed that several of these poor people that had so removed had the sickness even in their huts or booths; the reason of which was plain, namely, not because they removed into the air, but, (1) because they did not remove time enough; that is to say, not till, by openly conversing with the other people their neighbours, they had the distemper upon them, or (as may be said) among them, and so carried it about them whither they went. Or (2) because they were not careful enough, after they were safely removed out of the towns, not to come in again and mingle with the diseased people.

        But be it which of these it will, when our travellers began to perceive that the plague was not only in the towns, but even in the tents and huts on the forest near them, they began then not only to be afraid, but to think of decamping and removing; for had they stayed they would have been in manifest danger of their lives.

        It is not to be wondered that they were greatly afflicted at being obliged to quit the place where they had been so kindly received, and where they had been treated with so much humanity and charity; but necessity and the hazard of life, which they came out so far to preserve, prevailed with them, and they saw no remedy. John, however, thought of a remedy for their present misfortune: namely, that he would first acquaint that gentleman who was their principal benefactor with the distress they were in, and to crave his assistance and advice.

        The good, charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the Place for fear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by the violence of the distemper; but whither they should go, that he found very hard to direct them to. At last John asked of him whether he, being a justice of the peace, would give them certificates of health to other justices whom they might come before; that so whatever might be their lot, they might not be repulsed now they had been also so long from London. This his worship immediately granted, and gave them proper letters of health, and from thence they were at liberty to travel whither they pleased.

        Accordingly they had a full certificate of health, intimating that they had resided in a village in the county of Essex so long that, being examined and scrutinised sufficiently, and having been retired from all conversation for above forty days, without any appearance of sickness, they were therefore certainly concluded to be sound men, and might be safely entertained anywhere, having at last removed rather for fear of the plague which was come into such a town, rather than for having any signal of infection upon them, or upon any belonging to them.

        With this certificate they removed, though with great reluctance; and John inclining not to go far from home, they moved towards the marshes on the side of Waltham. But here they found a man who, it seems, kept a weir or stop upon the river, made to raise the water for the barges which go up and down the river, and he terrified them with dismal stories of the sickness having been spread into all the towns on the river and near the river, on the side of Middlesex and Hertfordshire; that is to say, into Waltham, Waltham Cross, Enfield, and Ware, and all the towns on the road, that they were afraid to go that way; though it seems the man imposed upon them, for that the thing was not really true.

        However, it terrified them, and they resolved to move across the forest towards Rumford and Brentwood; but they heard that there were numbers of people fled out of London that way, who lay up and down in the forest called Henalt Forest, reaching near Rumford, and who, having no subsistence or habitation, not only lived oddly and suffered great extremities in the woods and fields for want of relief, but were said to be made so desperate by those extremities as that they offered many violences to the county, robbed and plundered, and killed cattle, and the like; that others, building huts and hovels by the roadside, begged, and that with an importunity next door to demanding relief; so that the county was very uneasy, and had been obliged to take some of them up.

        This in the first place intimated to them, that they would be sure to find the charity and kindness of the county, which they had found here where they were before, hardened and shut up against them; and that, on the other hand, they would be questioned wherever they came, and would be in danger of violence from others in like cases as themselves.

        Upon all these considerations John, their captain, in all their names, went back to their good friend and benefactor, who had relieved them before, and laying their case truly before him, humbly asked his advice; and he as kindly advised them to take up their old quarters again, or if not, to remove but a little farther out of the road, and directed them to a proper place for them; and as they really wanted some house rather than huts to shelter them at that time of the year, it growing on towards Michaelmas, they found an old decayed house which had been formerly some cottage or little habitation but was so out of repair as scarce habitable; and by the consent of a farmer to whose farm it belonged, they got leave to make what use of it they could.

        The ingenious joiner, and all the rest, by his directions went to work with it, and in a very few days made it capable to shelter them all in case of bad weather; and in which there was an old chimney and old oven, though both lying in ruins; yet they made them both fit for use, and, raising additions, sheds, and leantos on every side, they soon made the house capable to hold them all.

        They chiefly wanted boards to make window-shutters, floors, doors, and several other things; but as the gentlemen above favoured them, and the country was by that means made easy with them, and above all, that they were known to be all sound and in good health, everybody helped them with what they could spare.

        Here they encamped for good and all, and resolved to remove no more. They saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was everywhere at anybody that came from London, and that they should have no admittance anywhere but with the utmost difficulty; at least no friendly reception and assistance as they had received here.

        Now, although they received great assistance and encouragement from the country gentlemen and from the people round about them, yet they were put to great straits: for the weather grew cold and wet in October and November, and they had not been used to so much hardship; so that they got colds in their limbs, and distempers, but never had the infection; and thus about December they came home to the city again.

        I give this story thus at large, principally to give an account what became of the great numbers of people which immediately appeared in the city as soon as the sickness abated; for, as I have said, great numbers of those that were able and had retreats in the country fled to those retreats. So, when it was increased to such a frightful extremity as I have related, the middling people who had not friends fled to all parts of the country where they could get shelter, as well those that had money to relieve themselves as those that had not. Those that had money always fled farthest, because they were able to subsist themselves; but those who were empty suffered, as I have said, great hardships, and were often driven by necessity to relieve their wants at the expense of the country. By that means the country was made very uneasy at them, and sometimes took them up; though even then they scarce knew what to do with them, and were always very backward to punish them, but often, too, they forced them from place to place till they were obliged to come back again to London.

        I have, since my knowing this story of John and his brother, inquired and found that there were a great many of the poor disconsolate people, as above, fled into the country every way; and some of them got little sheds and barns and outhouses to live in, where they could obtain so much kindness of the country, and especially where they had any the least satisfactory account to give of themselves, and particularly that they did not come out of London too late. But others, and that in great numbers, built themselves little huts and retreats in the fields and woods, and lived like hermits in holes and caves, or any place they could find, and where, we may be sure, they suffered great extremities, such that many of them were obliged to come back again whatever the danger was; and so those little huts were often found empty, and the country people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in them of the plague, and would not go near them for fear—no, not in a great while; nor is it unlikely but that some of the unhappy wanderers might die so all alone, even sometimes for want of help, as particularly in one tent or hut was found a man dead, and on the gate of a field just by was cut with his knife in uneven letters the following words, by which it may be supposed the other man escaped, or that, one dying first, the other buried him as well as he could:—

                 O mIsErY!
                 We BoTH ShaLL DyE,
                 WoE, WoE.

        I have given an account already of what I found to have been the case down the river among the seafaring men; how the ships lay in the offing, as it's called, in rows or lines astern of one another, quite down from the Pool as far as I could see. I have been told that they lay in the same manner quite down the river as low as Gravesend, and some far beyond: even everywhere or in every place where they could ride with safety as to wind and weather; nor did I ever hear that the plague reached to any of the people on board those ships—except such as lay up in the Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although the people went frequently on shore to the country towns and villages and farmers' houses, to buy fresh provisions, fowls, pigs, calves, and the like for their supply.

        Likewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge found means to convey themselves away up the river as far as they could go, and that they had, many of them, their whole families in their boats, covered with tilts and bales, as they call them, and furnished with straw within for their lodging, and that they lay thus all along by the shore in the marshes, some of them setting up little tents with their sails, and so lying under them on shore in the day, and going into their boats at night; and in this manner, as I have heard, the river-sides were lined with boats and people as long as they had anything to subsist on, or could get anything of the country; and indeed the country people, as well Gentlemen as others, on these and all other occasions, were very forward to relieve them—but they were by no means willing to receive them into their towns and houses, and for that we cannot blame them.

        There was one unhappy citizen within my knowledge who had been visited in a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his children were dead, and himself and two servants only left, with an elderly woman, a near relation, who had nursed those that were dead as well as she could. This disconsolate man goes to a village near the town, though not within the bills of mortality, and finding an empty house there, inquires out the owner, and took the house. After a few days he got a cart and loaded it with goods, and carries them down to the house; the people of the village opposed his driving the cart along; but with some arguings and some force, the men that drove the cart along got through the street up to the door of the house. There the constable resisted them again, and would not let them be brought in. The man caused the goods to be unloaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart away; upon which they carried the man before a justice of peace; that is to say, they commanded him to go, which he did. The justice ordered him to cause the cart to fetch away the goods again, which he refused to do; upon which the justice ordered the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them back, and make them reload the goods and carry them away, or to set them in the stocks till they came for further orders; and if they could not find them, nor the man would not consent to take them away, they should cause them to be drawn with hooks from the house-door and burned in the street. The poor distressed man upon this fetched the goods again, but with grievous cries and lamentations at the hardship of his case. But there was no remedy; self-preservation obliged the people to those severities which they would not otherwise have been concerned in. Whether this poor man lived or died I cannot tell, but it was reported that he had the plague upon him at that time; and perhaps the people might report that to justify their usage of him; but it was not unlikely that either he or his goods, or both, were dangerous, when his whole family had been dead of the distempers so little a while before.

        I know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were much blamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the contagion in their distress, and many very severe things were done, as may be seen from what has been said; but I cannot but say also that, where there was room for charity and assistance to the people, without apparent danger to themselves, they were willing enough to help and relieve them. But as every town were indeed judges in their own case, so the poor people who ran abroad in their extremities were often ill-used and driven back again into the town; and this caused infinite exclamations and outcries against the country towns, and made the clamour very popular.

        And yet, more or less, (with) all the caution, there was not a town of any note within ten (or, I believe, twenty) miles of the city but what was more or less infected and had some died among them. I have heard the accounts of several, such as they were reckoned up, as follows:—

        Another thing might render the country more strict with respect to the citizens, and especially with respect to the poor, and this was what I hinted at before: namely, that there was a seeming propensity or a wicked inclination in those that were infected to infect others.

        There have been great debates among our physicians as to the reason of this. Some will have it to be in the nature of the disease, and that it impresses every one that is seized upon by it with a kind of a rage, and a hatred against their own kind—as if there was a malignity not only in the distemper to communicate itself, but in the very nature of man, prompting him with evil will or an evil eye, that, as they say in the case of a mad dog, who though the gentlest creature before of any of his kind, yet then will fly upon and bite any one that comes next him, and those as soon as any who had been most observed by him before.

        Others placed it to the account of the corruption of human nature, who cannot bear to see itself more miserable than others of its own species, and has a kind of involuntary wish that all men were as unhappy or in as bad a condition as itself.

        Others say it was only a kind of desperation, not knowing or regarding what they did, and consequently unconcerned at the danger or safety not only of anybody near them, but even of themselves also. And indeed, when men are once come to a condition to abandon themselves, and be unconcerned for the safety or at the danger of themselves, it cannot be so much wondered that they should be careless of the safety of other people.

        But I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn, and answer it or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the fact. On the contrary, I say that the thing is not really so, but that it was a general complaint raised by the people inhabiting the outlying villages against the citizens to justify, or at least excuse, those hardships and severities so much talked of, and in which complaints both sides may be said to have injured one another; that is to say, the citizens pressing to be received and harboured in time of distress, and with the plague upon them, complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people in being refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and families; and the inhabitants, finding themselves so imposed upon, and the citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether they would or no, complain that when they were infected they were not only regardless of others, but even willing to infect them; neither of which were really true—that is to say, in the colours they were described in.

        It is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms which were given to the country of the resolution of the people of London to come out by force, not only for relief, but to plunder and rob; that they ran about the streets with the distemper upon them without any control; and that no care was taken to shut up houses, and confine the sick people from infecting others; whereas, to do the Londoners justice, they never practised such things, except in such particular cases as I have mentioned above, and such like. On the other hand, everything was managed with so much care, and such excellent order was observed in the whole city and suburbs by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen and by the justices of the peace, church-wardens, &c., in the outparts, that London may be a pattern to all the cities in the world for the good government and the excellent order that was everywhere kept, even in the time of the most violent infection, and when the people were in the utmost consternation and distress. But of this I shall speak by itself.

        One thing, it is to be observed, was owing principally to the prudence of the magistrates, and ought to be mentioned to their honour: viz., the moderation which they used in the great and difficult work of shutting up of houses. It is true, as I have mentioned, that the shutting up of houses was a great subject of discontent, and I may say indeed the only subject of discontent among the people at that time; for the confining the sound in the same house with the sick was counted very terrible, and the complaints of people so confined were very grievous. They were heard into the very streets, and they were sometimes such that called for resentment, though oftener for compassion. They had no way to converse with any of their friends but out at their windows, where they would make such piteous lamentations as often moved the hearts of those they talked with, and of others who, passing by, heard their story; and as those complaints oftentimes reproached the severity, and sometimes the insolence, of the watchmen placed at their doors, those watchmen would answer saucily enough, and perhaps be apt to affront the people who were in the street talking to the said families; for which, or for their ill-treatment of the families, I think seven or eight of them in several places were killed; I know not whether I should say murdered or not, because I cannot enter into the particular cases. It is true the watchmen were on their duty, and acting in the post where they were placed by a lawful authority; and killing any public legal officer in the execution of his office is always, in the language of the law, called murder. But as they were not authorised by the magistrates' instructions, or by the power they acted under, to be injurious or abusive either to the people who were under their observation or to any that concerned themselves for them; so when they did so, they might be said to act themselves, not their office; to act as private persons, not as persons employed; and consequently, if they brought mischief upon themselves by such an undue behaviour, that mischief was upon their own heads; and indeed they had so much the hearty curses of the people, whether they deserved it or not, that whatever befell them nobody pitied them, and everybody was apt to say they deserved it, whatever it was. Nor do I remember that anybody was ever punished, at least to any considerable degree, for whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded their houses.

        What variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of houses thus shut up, by which the watchmen were deceived or overpowered, and that the people got away, I have taken notice of already, and shall say no more to that. But I say the magistrates did moderate and ease families upon many occasions in this case, and particularly in that of taking away, or suffering to be removed, the sick persons out of such houses when they were willing to be removed either to a pest-house or other Places; and sometimes giving the well persons in the family so shut up, leave to remove upon information given that they were well, and that they would confine themselves in such houses where they went so long as should be required of them. The concern, also, of the magistrates for the supplying such poor families as were infected—I say, supplying them with necessaries, as well physic as food—was very great, and in which they did not content themselves with giving the necessary orders to the officers appointed, but the aldermen in person, and on horseback, frequently rode to such houses and caused the people to be asked at their windows whether they were duly attended or not; also, whether they wanted anything that was necessary, and if the officers had constantly carried their messages and fetched them such things as they wanted or not. And if they answered in the affirmative, all was well; but if they complained that they were ill supplied, and that the officer did not do his duty, or did not treat them civilly, they (the officers) were generally removed, and others placed in their stead.

        It is true such complaint might be unjust, and if the officer had such arguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he was right, and that the people had injured him, he was continued and they reproved. But this part could not well bear a particular inquiry, for the parties could very ill be well heard and answered in the street from the windows, as was the case then. The magistrates, therefore, generally chose to favour the people and remove the man, as what seemed to be the least wrong and of the least ill consequence; seeing if the watchman was injured, yet they could easily make him amends by giving him another post of the like nature; but if the family was injured, there was no satisfaction could be made to them, the damage perhaps being irreparable, as it concerned their lives.

        A great variety of these cases frequently happened between the watchmen and the poor people shut up, besides those I formerly mentioned about escaping. Sometimes the watchmen were absent, sometimes drunk, sometimes asleep when the people wanted them, and such never failed to be punished severely, as indeed they deserved.

        But after all that was or could be done in these cases, the shutting up of houses, so as to confine those that were well with those that were sick, had very great inconveniences in it, and some that were very tragical, and which merited to have been considered if there had been room for it. But it was authorised by a law, it had the public good in view as the end chiefly aimed at, and all the private injuries that were done by the putting it in execution must be put to the account of the public benefit.

        It is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it contributed anything to the stop of the infection; and indeed I cannot say it did, for nothing could run with greater fury and rage than the infection did when it was in its chief violence, though the houses infected were shut up as exactly and as effectually as it was possible. Certain it is that if all the infected persons were effectually shut in, no sound person could have been infected by them, because they could not have come near them. But the case was this (and I shall only touch it here): namely, that the infection was propagated insensibly, and by such persons as were not visibly infected, who neither knew whom they infected or who they were infected by.

        A house in Whitechappel was shut up for the sake of one infected maid, who had only spots, not the tokens come out upon her, and recovered; yet these people obtained no liberty to stir, neither for air or exercise, forty days. Want of breath, fear, anger, vexation, and all the other gifts attending such an injurious treatment cast the mistress of the family into a fever, and visitors came into the house and said it was the plague, though the physicians declared it was not. However, the family were obliged to begin their quarantine anew on the report of the visitors or examiner, though their former quarantine wanted but a few days of being finished. This oppressed them so with anger and grief, and, as before, straitened them also so much as to room, and for want of breathing and free air, that most of the family fell sick, one of one distemper, one of another, chiefly scorbutic ailments; only one, a violent colic; till, after several prolongings of their confinement, some or other of those that came in with the visitors to inspect the persons that were ill, in hopes of releasing them, brought the distemper with them and infected the whole house; and all or most of them died, not of the plague as really upon them before, but of the plague that those people brought them, who should have been careful to have protected them from it. And this was a thing which frequently happened, and was indeed one of the worst consequences of shutting houses up.

        I had about this time a little hardship put upon me, which I was at first greatly afflicted at, and very much disturbed about though, as it proved, it did not expose me to any disaster; and this was being appointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one of the examiners of the houses in the precinct where I lived. We had a large parish, and had no less than eighteen examiners, as the order called us; the people called us visitors. I endeavoured with all my might to be excused from such an employment, and used many arguments with the alderman's deputy to be excused; particularly I alleged that I was against shutting up houses at all, and that it would be very hard to oblige me to be an instrument in that which was against my judgement, and which I did verily believe would not answer the end it was intended for; but all the abatement I could get was only, that whereas the officer was appointed by my Lord Mayor to continue two months, I should be obliged to hold it but three weeks, on condition nevertheless that I could then get some other sufficient housekeeper to serve the rest of the time for me—which was, in short, but a very small favour, it being very difficult to get any man to accept of such an employment, that was fit to be entrusted with it.

        It is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, which I am sensible was of moment, namely, it confined the distempered people, who would otherwise have been both very troublesome and very dangerous in their running about streets with the distemper upon them—which, when they were delirious, they would have done in a most frightful manner, and as indeed they began to do at first very much, till they were thus restrained; nay, so very open they were that the poor would go about and beg at people's doors, and say they had the plague upon them, and beg rags for their sores, or both, or anything that delirious nature happened to think of.

        A poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citizen's wife, was (if the story be true) murdered by one of these creatures in Aldersgate Street, or that way. He was going along the street, raving mad to be sure, and singing; the people only said he was drunk, but he himself said he had the plague upon him, which it seems was true; and meeting this gentlewoman, he would kiss her. She was terribly frighted, as he was only a rude fellow, and she ran from him, but the street being very thin of people, there was nobody near enough to help her. When she saw he would overtake her, she turned and gave him a thrust so forcibly, he being but weak, and pushed him down backward. But very unhappily, she being so near, he caught hold of her and pulled her down also, and getting up first, mastered her and kissed her; and which was worst of all, when he had done, told her he had the plague, and why should not she have it as well as he? She was frighted enough before, being also young with child; but when she heard him say he had the plague, she screamed out and fell down into a swoon, or in a fit, which, though she recovered a little, yet killed her in a very few days; and I never heard whether she had the plague or no.

        Another infected person came and knocked at the door of a citizen's house where they knew him very well; the servant let him in, and being told the master of the house was above, he ran up and came into the room to them as the whole family was at supper. They began to rise up, a little surprised, not knowing what the matter was; but he bid them sit still, he only came to take his leave of them. They asked him, 'Why, Mr—, where are you going?' 'Going,' says he; 'I have got the sickness, and shall die tomorrow night.' 'Tis easy to believe, though not to describe, the consternation they were all in. The women and the man's daughters, which were but little girls, were frighted almost to death and got up, one running out at one door and one at another, some downstairs and some upstairs, and getting together as well as they could, locked themselves into their chambers and screamed out at the window for help, as if they had been frighted out of their wits. The master, more composed than they, though both frighted and provoked, was going to lay hands on him and throw him downstairs, being in a passion; but then, considering a little the condition of the man and the danger of touching him, horror seized his mind, and he stood still like one astonished. The poor distempered man all this while, being as well diseased in his brain as in his body, stood still like one amazed. At length he turns round: 'Ay!' says he, with all the seeming calmness imaginable, 'is it so with you all? Are you all disturbed at me? Why, then I'll e'en go home and die there.' And so he goes immediately downstairs. The servant that had let him in goes down after him with a candle, but was afraid to go past him and open the door, so he stood on the stairs to see what he would do. The man went and opened the door, and went out and flung the door after him. It was some while before the family recovered the fright, but as no ill consequence attended, they have had occasion since to speak of it (You may be sure) with great satisfaction. Though the man was gone, it was some time—nay, as I heard, some days before they recovered themselves of the hurry they were in; nor did they go up and down the house with any assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes and perfumes in all the rooms, and made a great many smokes of pitch, of gunpowder, and of sulphur, all separately shifted, and washed their clothes, and the like. As to the poor man, whether he lived or died I don't remember.

        It is most certain that, if by the shutting up of houses the sick had not been confined, multitudes who in the height of their fever were delirious and distracted would have been continually running up and down the streets; and even as it was a very great number did so, and offered all sorts of violence to those they met, even just as a mad dog runs on and bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but that, should one of those infected, diseased creatures have bitten any man or woman while the frenzy of the distemper was upon them, they, I mean the person so wounded, would as certainly have been incurably infected as one that was sick before, and had the tokens upon him.

        I heard of one infected creature who, running out of his bed in his shirt in the anguish and agony of his swellings, of which he had three upon him, got his shoes on and went to put on his coat; but the nurse resisting, and snatching the coat from him, he threw her down, ran over her, ran downstairs and into the street, directly to the Thames in his shirt; the nurse running after him, and calling to the watch to stop him; but the watchman, frighted at the man, and afraid to touch him, let him go on; upon which he ran down to the Stillyard stairs, threw away his shirt, and plunged into the Thames, and, being a good swimmer, swam quite over the river; and the tide being coming in, as they call it (that is, running westward) he reached the land not till he came about the Falcon stairs, where landing, and finding no people there, it being in the night, he ran about the streets there, naked as he was, for a good while, when, it being by that time high water, he takes the river again, and swam back to the Stillyard, landed, ran up the streets again to his own house, knocking at the door, went up the stairs and into his bed again; and that this terrible experiment cured him of the plague, that is to say, that the violent motion of his arms and legs stretched the parts where the swellings he had upon him were, that is to say, under his arms and his groin, and caused them to ripen and break; and that the cold of the water abated the fever in his blood.

        I have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some of the other, as a fact within my own knowledge, so as that I can vouch the truth of them, and especially that of the man being cured by the extravagant adventure, which I confess I do not think very possible; but it may serve to confirm the many desperate things which the distressed people falling into deliriums, and what we call light-headedness, were frequently run upon at that time, and how infinitely more such there would have been if such people had not been confined by the shutting up of houses; and this I take to be the best, if not the only good thing which was performed by that severe method.

        On the other hand, the complaints and the murmurings were very bitter against the thing itself. It would pierce the hearts of all that came by to hear the piteous cries of those infected people, who, being thus out of their understandings by the violence of their pain or the heat of their blood, were either shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and chairs, to prevent their doing themselves hurt—and who would make a dreadful outcry at their being confined, and at their being not permitted to die at large, as they called it, and as they would have done before.

        This running of distempered people about the streets was very dismal, and the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but as it was generally in the night and always sudden when such attempts were made, the officers could not be at hand to prevent it; and even when any got out in the day, the officers appointed did not care to meddle with them, because, as they were all grievously infected, to be sure, when they were come to that height, so they were more than ordinarily infectious, and it was one of the most dangerous things that could be to touch them. On the other hand, they generally ran on, not knowing what they did, till they dropped down stark dead, or till they had exhausted their spirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps half-an-hour or an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear, they were sure to come to themselves entirely in that half-hour or hour, and then to make most grievous and piercing cries and lamentations in the deep, afflicting sense of the condition they were in. This was much of it before the order for shutting up of houses was strictly put in execution, for at first the watchmen were not so vigorous and severe as they were afterward in the keeping the people in; that is to say, before they were (I mean some of them) severely punished for their neglect, failing in their duty, and letting people who were under their care slip away, or conniving at their going abroad, whether sick or well. But after they saw the officers appointed to examine into their conduct were resolved to have them do their duty or be punished for the omission, they were more exact, and the people were strictly restrained; which was a thing they took so ill and bore so impatiently that their discontents can hardly be described. But there was an absolute necessity for it, that must be confessed, unless some other measures had been timely entered upon, and it was too late for that.

        Had not this particular (of the sick being restrained as above) been our case at that time, London would have been the most dreadful place that ever was in the world; there would, for aught I know, have as many people died in the streets as died in their houses; for when the distemper was at its height it generally made them raving and delirious, and when they were so they would never be persuaded to keep in their beds but by force; and many who were not tied threw themselves out of windows when they found they could not get leave to go out of their doors.

        It was for want of people conversing one with another, in this time of calamity, that it was impossible any particular person could come at the knowledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in different families; and particularly I believe it was never known to this day how many people in their deliriums drowned themselves in the Thames, and in the river which runs from the marshes by Hackney, which we generally called Ware River, or Hackney River. As to those which were set down in the weekly bill, they were indeed few; nor could it be known of any of those whether they drowned themselves by accident or not. But I believe I might reckon up more who within the compass of my knowledge or observation really drowned themselves in that year, than are put down in the bill of all put together: for many of the bodies were never found who yet were known to be lost; and the like in other methods of self-destruction. There was also one man in or about Whitecross Street burned himself to death in his bed; some said it was done by himself, others that it was by the treachery of the nurse that attended him; but that he had the plague upon him was agreed by all.

        It was a merciful disposition of Providence also, and which I have many times thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable ones at least, happened in the city during that year, which, if it had been otherwise, would have been very dreadful; and either the people must have let them alone unquenched, or have come together in great crowds and throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not concerned at the houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or at the persons or the people they came among. But so it was, that excepting that in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little eruptions of fires, which were presently extinguished, there was no disaster of that kind happened in the whole year. They told us a story of a house in a place called Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the end of Old Street, into St John Street, that a family was infected there in so terrible a manner that every one of the house died. The last person lay dead on the floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all along to die just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its place, being of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the joists they lay on, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had not taken hold of the dead body (though she had little more than her shift on) and had gone out of itself, not burning the rest of the house, though it was a slight timber house. How true this might be I do not determine, but the city being to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very little of that calamity.

        Indeed, considering the deliriums which the agony threw people into, and how I have mentioned in their madness, when they were alone, they did many desperate things, it was very strange there were no more disasters of that kind.

        It has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say that I ever knew how to give a direct answer to it, how it came to pass that so many infected people appeared abroad in the streets at the same time that the houses which were infected were so vigilantly searched, and all of them shut up and guarded as they were.

        I confess I know not what answer to give to this, unless it be this: that in so great and populous a city as this is it was impossible to discover every house that was infected as soon as it was so, or to shut up all the houses that were infected; so that people had the liberty of going about the streets, even where they Pleased, unless they were known to belong to such-and-such infected houses.

        It is true that, as several physicians told my Lord Mayor, the fury of the contagion was such at some particular times, and people sickened so fast and died so soon, that it was impossible, and indeed to no purpose, to go about to inquire who was sick and who was well, or to shut them up with such exactness as the thing required, almost every house in a whole street being infected, and in many places every person in some of the houses; and that which was still worse, by the time that the houses were known to be infected, most of the persons infected would be stone dead, and the rest run away for fear of being shut up; so that it was to very small purpose to call them infected houses and shut them up, the infection having ravaged and taken its leave of the house before it was really known that the family was any way touched.

        This might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person that as it was not in the power of the magistrates or of any human methods of policy, to prevent the spreading the infection, so that this way of shutting up of houses was perfectly insufficient for that end. Indeed it seemed to have no manner of public good in it, equal or proportionable to the grievous burden that it was to the particular families that were so shut up; and, as far as I was employed by the public in directing that severity, I frequently found occasion to see that it was incapable of answering the end. For example, as I was desired, as a visitor or examiner, to inquire into the particulars of several families which were infected, we scarce came to any house where the plague had visibly appeared in the family but that some of the family were fled and gone. The magistrates would resent this, and charge the examiners with being remiss in their examination or inspection. But by that means houses were long infected before it was known. Now, as I was in this dangerous office but half the appointed time, which was two months, it was long enough to inform myself that we were no way capable of coming at the knowledge of the true state of any family but by inquiring at the door or of the neighbours. As for going into every house to search, that was a part no authority would offer to impose on the inhabitants, or any citizen would undertake: for it would have been exposing us to certain infection and death, and to the ruin of our own families as well as of ourselves; nor would any citizen of probity, and that could be depended upon, have stayed in the town if they had been made liable to such a severity.

        Seeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no method but that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family, and on that we could not justly depend, it was not possible but that the uncertainty of this matter would remain as above.

        It is true masters of families were bound by the order to give notice to the examiner of the place wherein he lived, within two hours after he should discover it, of any person being sick in his house (that is to say, having signs of the infection)—but they found so many ways to evade this and excuse their negligence that they seldom gave that notice till they had taken measures to have every one escape out of the house who had a mind to escape, whether they were sick or sound; and while this was so, it is easy to see that the shutting up of houses was no way to be depended upon as a sufficient method for putting a stop to the infection because, as I have said elsewhere, many of those that so went out of those infected houses had the plague really upon them, though they might really think themselves sound. And some of these were the people that walked the streets till they fell down dead, not that they were suddenly struck with the distemper as with a bullet that killed with the stroke, but that they really had the infection in their blood long before; only, that as it preyed secretly on the vitals, it appeared not till it seized the heart with a mortal power, and the patient died in a moment, as with a sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit.

        I know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that those people that so died in the streets were seized but that moment they fell, as if they had been touched by a stroke from heaven as men are killed by a flash of lightning—but they found reason to alter their opinion afterward; for upon examining the bodies of such after they were dead, they always either had tokens upon them or other evident proofs of the distemper having been longer upon them than they had otherwise expected.

        This often was the reason that, as I have said, we that were examiners were not able to come at the knowledge of the infection being entered into a house till it was too late to shut it up, and sometimes not till the people that were left were all dead. In Petticoat Lane two houses together were infected, and several people sick; but the distemper was so well concealed, the examiner, who was my neighbour, got no knowledge of it till notice was sent him that the people were all dead, and that the carts should call there to fetch them away. The two heads of the families concerted their measures, and so ordered their matters as that when the examiner was in the neighbourhood they appeared generally at a time, and answered, that is, lied, for one another, or got some of the neighbourhood to say they were all in health—and perhaps knew no better—till, death making it impossible to keep it any longer as a secret, the dead-carts were called in the night to both the houses, and so it became public. But when the examiner ordered the constable to shut up the houses there was nobody left in them but three people, two in one house and one in the other, just dying, and a nurse in each house who acknowledged that they had buried five before, that the houses had been infected nine or ten days, and that for all the rest of the two families, which were many, they were gone, some sick, some well, or whether sick or well could not be known.

        In like manner, at another house in the same lane, a man having his family infected but very unwilling to be shut up, when he could conceal it no longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he set the great red cross upon his door with the words, 'Lord have mercy upon us', and so deluded the examiner, who supposed it had been done by the constable by order of the other examiner, for there were two examiners to every district or precinct. By this means he had free egress and regress into his house again and out of it, as he pleased, notwithstanding it was infected, till at length his stratagem was found out; and then he, with the sound part of his servants and family, made off and escaped, so they were not shut up at all.

        These things made it very hard, if not impossible, as I have said, to prevent the spreading of an infection by the shutting up of houses—unless the people would think the shutting of their houses no grievance, and be so willing to have it done as that they would give notice duly and faithfully to the magistrates of their being infected as soon as it was known by themselves; but as that cannot be expected from them, and the examiners cannot be supposed, as above, to go into their houses to visit and search, all the good of shutting up houses will be defeated, and few houses will be shut up in time, except those of the poor, who cannot conceal it, and of some people who will be discovered by the terror and consternation which the things put them into.

        I got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon as I could get another admitted, whom I had obtained for a little money to accept of it; and so, instead of serving the two months, which was directed, I was not above three weeks in it; and a great while too, considering it was in the month of August, at which time the distemper began to rage with great violence at our end of the town.
In the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my opinion among my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in their houses; in which we saw most evidently the severities that were used, though grievous in themselves, had also this particular objection against them: namely, that they did not answer the end, as I have said, but that the distempered people went day by day about the streets; and it was our united opinion that a method to have removed the sound from the sick, in case of a particular house being visited, would have been much more reasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody with the sick persons but such as should on such occasion request to stay and declare themselves content to be shut up with them.

        Our scheme for removing those that were sound from those that were sick was only in such houses as were infected, and confining the sick was no confinement; those that could not stir would not complain while they were in their senses and while they had the power of judging. Indeed, when they came to be delirious and light-headed, then they would cry out of the cruelty of being confined; but for the removal of those that were well, we thought it highly reasonable and just, for their own sakes, they should be removed from the sick, and that for other people's safety they should keep retired for a while, to see that they were sound, and might not infect others; and we thought twenty or thirty days enough for this.

        Now, certainly, if houses had been provided on purpose for those that were sound to perform this demi-quarantine in, they would have much less reason to think themselves injured in such a restraint than in being confined with infected people in the houses where they lived.

        It is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals became so many that people could not toll the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black for one another, as they did before; no, nor so much as make coffins for those that died; so after a while the fury of the infection appeared to be so increased that, in short, they shut up no houses at all. It seemed enough that all the remedies of that kind had been used till they were found fruitless, and that the plague spread itself with an irresistible fury; so that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself, and burned with such violence that the citizens, in despair, gave over their endeavours to extinguish it, so in the plague it came at last to such violence that the people sat still looking at one another, and seemed quite abandoned to despair; whole streets seemed to be desolated, and not to be shut up only, but to be emptied of their inhabitants; doors were left open, windows stood shattering with the wind in empty houses for want of people to shut them. In a word, people began to give up themselves to their fears and to think that all regulations and methods were in vain, and that there was nothing to be hoped for but an universal desolation; and it was even in the height of this general despair that it Pleased God to stay His hand, and to slacken the fury of the contagion in such a manner as was even surprising, like its beginning, and demonstrated it to be His own particular hand, and that above, if not without the agency of means, as I shall take notice of in its proper place.

        But I must still speak of the plague as in its height, raging even to desolation, and the people under the most dreadful consternation, even, as I have said, to despair. It is hardly credible to what excess the passions of men carried them in this extremity of the distemper, and this part, I think, was as moving as the rest. What could affect a man in his full power of reflection, and what could make deeper impressions on the soul, than to see a man almost naked, and got out of his house, or perhaps out of his bed, into the street, come out of Harrow Alley, a populous conjunction or collection of alleys, courts, and passages in the Butcher Row in Whitechappel,—I say, what could be more affecting than to see this poor man come out into the open street, run dancing and singing and making a thousand antic gestures, with five or six women and children running after him, crying and calling upon him for the Lord's sake to come back, and entreating the help of others to bring him back, but all in vain, nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come near him?

        This was a most grievous and afflicting thing to me, who saw it all from my own windows; for all this while the poor afflicted man was, as I observed it, even then in the utmost agony of pain, having (as they said) two swellings upon him which could not be brought to break or to suppurate; but, by laying strong caustics on them, the surgeons had, it seems, hopes to break them—which caustics were then upon him, burning his flesh as with a hot iron. I cannot say what became of this poor man, but I think he continued roving about in that manner till he fell down and died.

        No wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful. The usual concourse of people in the streets, and which used to be supplied from our end of the town, was abated. The Exchange was not kept shut, indeed, but it was no more frequented. The fires were lost; they had been almost extinguished for some days by a very smart and hasty rain. But that was not all; some of the physicians insisted that they were not only no benefit, but injurious to the health of people. This they made a loud clamour about, and complained to the Lord Mayor about it. On the other hand, others of the same faculty, and eminent too, opposed them, and gave their reasons why the fires were, and must be, useful to assuage the violence of the distemper. I cannot give a full account of their arguments on both sides; only this I remember, that they cavilled very much with one another. Some were for fires, but that they must be made of wood and not coal, and of particular sorts of wood too, such as fir in particular, or cedar, because of the strong effluvia of turpentine; others were for coal and not wood, because of the sulphur and bitumen; and others were for neither one or other. Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor ordered no more fires, and especially on this account, namely, that the plague was so fierce that they saw evidently it defied all means, and rather seemed to increase than decrease upon any application to check and abate it; and yet this amazement of the magistrates proceeded rather from want of being able to apply any means successfully than from any unwillingness either to expose themselves or undertake the care and weight of business; for, to do them justice, they neither spared their pains nor their persons. But nothing answered; the infection raged, and the people were now frighted and terrified to the last degree: so that, as I may say, they gave themselves up, and, as I mentioned above, abandoned themselves to their despair.

        But let me observe here that, when I say the people abandoned themselves to despair, I do not mean to what men call a religious despair, or a despair of their eternal state, but I mean a despair of their being able to escape the infection or to outlive the plague which they saw was so raging and so irresistible in its force that indeed few people that were touched with it in its height, about August and September, escaped; and, which is very particular, contrary to its ordinary operation in June and July, and the beginning of August, when, as I have observed, many were infected, and continued so many days, and then went off after having had the poison in their blood a long time; but now, on the contrary, most of the people who were taken during the two last weeks in August and in the three first weeks in September, generally died in two or three days at furthest, and many the very same day they were taken; whether the dog-days, or, as our astrologers pretended to express themselves, the influence of the dog-star, had that malignant effect, or all those who had the seeds of infection before in them brought it up to a maturity at that time altogether, I know not; but this was the time when it was reported that above 3000 people died in one night; and they that would have us believe they more critically observed it pretend to say that they all died within the space of two hours, viz., between the hours of one and three in the morning.

        As to the suddenness of people's dying at this time, more than before, there were innumerable instances of it, and I could name several in my neighbourhood. One family without the Bars, and not far from me, were all seemingly well on the Monday, being ten in family. That evening one maid and one apprentice were taken ill and died the next morning—when the other apprentice and two children were touched, whereof one died the same evening, and the other two on Wednesday. In a word, by Saturday at noon the master, mistress, four children, and four servants were all gone, and the house left entirely empty, except an ancient woman who came in to take charge of the goods for the master of the family's brother, who lived not far off, and who had not been sick.

        Many houses were then left desolate, all the people being carried away dead, and especially in an alley farther on the same side beyond the Bars, going in at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there were several houses together which, they said, had not one person left alive in them; and some that died last in several of those houses were left a little too long before they were fetched out to be buried; the reason of which was not, as some have written very untruly, that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead, but that the mortality was so great in the yard or alley that there was nobody left to give notice to the buriers or sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried. It was said, how true I know not, that some of those bodies were so much corrupted and so rotten that it was with difficulty they were carried; and as the carts could not come any nearer than to the Alley Gate in the High Street, it was so much the more difficult to bring them along; but I am not certain how many bodies were then left. I am sure that ordinarily it was not so.

        As I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition to despair of life and abandon themselves, so this very thing had a strange effect among us for three or four weeks; that is, it made them bold and venturous: they were no more shy of one another, or restrained within doors, but went anywhere and everywhere, and began to converse. One would say to another, 'I do not ask you how you are, or say how I am; it is certain we shall all go; so 'tis no matter who is all sick or who is sound'; and so they ran desperately into any place or any company.

        As it brought the people into public company, so it was surprising how it brought them to crowd into the churches. They inquired no more into whom they sat near to or far from, what offensive smells they met with, or what condition the people seemed to be in; but, looking upon themselves all as so many dead corpses, they came to the churches without the least caution, and crowded together as if their lives were of no consequence compared to the work which they came about there. Indeed, the zeal which they showed in coming, and the earnestness and affection they showed in their attention to what they heard, made it manifest what a value people would all put upon the worship of God if they thought every day they attended at the church that it would be their last.

        Nor was it without other strange effects, for it took away, all manner of prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they found in the pulpit when they came to the churches. It cannot be doubted but that many of the ministers of the parish churches were cut off, among others, in so common and dreadful a calamity; and others had not courage enough to stand it, but removed into the country as they found means for escape. As then some parish churches were quite vacant and forsaken, the people made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had been a few years before deprived of their livings by virtue of the Act of Parliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the churches; nor did the church ministers in that case make any difficulty of accepting their assistance; so that many of those whom they called silenced ministers had their mouths opened on this occasion and preached publicly to the people.

        Here we may observe and I hope it will not be amiss to take notice of it that a near view of death would soon reconcile men of good principles one to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy situation in life and our putting these things far from us that our breaches are fomented, ill blood continued, prejudices, breach of charity and of Christian union, so much kept and so far carried on among us as it is. Another plague year would reconcile all these differences; a close conversing with death, or with diseases that threaten death, would scum off the gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us, and bring us to see with differing eyes than those which we looked on things with before. As the people who had been used to join with the Church were reconciled at this time with the admitting the Dissenters to preach to them, so the Dissenters, who with an uncommon prejudice had broken off from the communion of the Church of England, were now content to come to their parish churches and to conform to the worship which they did not approve of before; but as the terror of the infection abated, those things all returned again to their less desirable channel and to the course they were in before.

        I mention this but historically. I have no mind to enter into arguments to move either or both sides to a more charitable compliance one with another. I do not see that it is probable such a discourse would be either suitable or successful; the breaches seem rather to widen, and tend to a widening further, than to closing, and who am I that I should think myself able to influence either one side or other? But this I may repeat again, that 'tis evident death will reconcile us all; on the other side the grave we shall be all brethren again. In heaven, whither I hope we may come from all parties and persuasions, we shall find neither prejudice or scruple; there we shall be of one principle and of one opinion. Why we cannot be content to go hand in hand to the Place where we shall join heart and hand without the least hesitation, and with the most complete harmony and affection—I say, why we cannot do so here I can say nothing to, neither shall I say anything more of it but that it remains to be lamented.

        I could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful time, and go on to describe the objects that appeared among us every day, the dreadful extravagancies which the distraction of sick people drove them into; how the streets began now to be fuller of frightful objects, and families to be made even a terror to themselves. But after I have told you, as I have above, that one man, being tied in his bed, and finding no other way to deliver himself, set the bed on fire with his candle, which unhappily stood within his reach, and burnt himself in his bed; and how another, by the insufferable torment he bore, danced and sung naked in the streets, not knowing one ecstasy from another; I say, after I have mentioned these things, what can be added more? What can be said to represent the misery of these times more lively to the reader, or to give him a more perfect idea of a complicated distress?

        I must acknowledge that this time was terrible, that I was sometimes at the end of all my resolutions, and that I had not the courage that I had at the beginning. As the extremity brought other people abroad, it drove me home, and except having made my voyage down to Blackwall and Greenwich, as I have related, which was an excursion, I kept afterwards very much within doors, as I had for about a fortnight before. I have said already that I repented several times that I had ventured to stay in town, and had not gone away with my brother and his family, but it was too late for that now; and after I had retreated and stayed within doors a good while before my impatience led me abroad, then they called me, as I have said, to an ugly and dangerous office which brought me out again; but as that was expired while the height of the distemper lasted, I retired again, and continued close ten or twelve days more, during which many dismal spectacles represented themselves in my view out of my own windows and in our own street—as that particularly from Harrow Alley, of the poor outrageous creature which danced and sung in his agony; and many others there were. Scarce a day or night passed over but some dismal thing or other happened at the end of that Harrow Alley, which was a place full of poor people, most of them belonging to the butchers or to employments depending upon the butchery.

        Sometimes heaps and throngs of people would burst out of the alley, most of them women, making a dreadful clamour, mixed or compounded of screeches, cryings, and calling one another, that we could not conceive what to make of it. Almost all the dead part of the night the dead-cart stood at the end of that alley, for if it went in it could not well turn again, and could go in but a little way. There, I say, it stood to receive dead bodies, and as the churchyard was but a little way off, if it went away full it would soon be back again. It is impossible to describe the most horrible cries and noise the poor people would make at their bringing the dead bodies of their children and friends out of the cart, and by the number one would have thought there had been none left behind, or that there were people enough for a small city living in those places. Several times they cried 'Murder', sometimes 'Fire'; but it was easy to perceive it was all distraction, and the complaints of distressed and distempered people.

        I believe it was everywhere thus as that time, for the plague raged for six or seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed, and came even to such a height that, in the extremity, they began to break into that excellent order of which I have spoken so much in behalf of the magistrates; namely, that no dead bodies were seen in the street or burials in the daytime: for there was a necessity in this extremity to bear with its being otherwise for a little while.

        One thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I thought it was extraordinary, at least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine justice: viz., that all the predictors, astrologers, fortune-tellers, and what they called cunning-men, conjurers, and the like: calculators of nativities and dreamers of dream, and such people, were gone and vanished; not one of them was to be found. I am verily persuaded that a great number of them fell in the heat of the calamity, having ventured to stay upon the prospect of getting great estates; and indeed their gain was but too great for a time, through the madness and folly of the people. But now they were silent; many of them went to their long home, not able to foretell their own fate or to calculate their own nativities. Some have been critical enough to say that every one of them died. I dare not affirm that; but this I must own, that I never heard of one of them that ever appeared after the calamity was over.

        But to return to my particular observations during this dreadful part of the visitation. I am now come, as I have said, to the month of September, which was the most dreadful of its kind, I believe, that ever London saw; for, by all the accounts which I have seen of the preceding visitations which have been in London, nothing has been like it, the number in the weekly bill amounting to almost 40,000 from the 22nd of August to the 26th of September, being but five weeks. The particulars of the bills are as follows, viz.:—

From August the     22nd     to the     29th                     7496
""             ""                 29th         ""         5th September    8252
"" September the         5th         ""         12th                    7690
""             ""                 12th         ""         19th                    8297
""             ""                 19th         ""         26th                    6460
-                                                                                     ——-
-                                                                                     38,195

        This was a prodigious number of itself, but if I should add the reasons which I have to believe that this account was deficient, and how deficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple to believe that there died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks, one week with another, and a proportion for several weeks both before and after. The confusion among the people, especially within the city, at that time, was inexpressible. The terror was so great at last that the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them; nay, several of them died, although they had the distemper before and were recovered, and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying the bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them in; and this confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered themselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of death was past. One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of the drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he died in the street; and the horses going on overthrew the cart, and left the bodies, some thrown out here, some there, in a dismal manner. Another cart was, it seems, found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead, or having been gone and abandoned it, and the horses running too near it, the cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was suggested that the driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him, by reason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I suppose, could not be certain.

        In our parish of Aldgate the dead-carts were several times, as I have heard, found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead bodies, but neither bellman or driver or any one else with it; neither in these or many other cases did they know what bodies they had in their cart, for sometimes they were let down with ropes out of balconies and out of windows, and sometimes the bearers brought them to the cart, sometimes other people; nor, as the men themselves said, did they trouble themselves to keep any account of the numbers.

        The vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost trial—and, it must be confessed, can never be enough acknowledged on this occasion also; whatever expense or trouble they were at, two things were never neglected in the city or suburbs either:—

         (1) Provisions were always to be had in full plenty, and the price not much raised neither, hardly worth speaking.

         (2) No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered; and if one walked from one end of the city to another, no funeral or sign of it was to be seen in the daytime, except a little, as I have said above, in the three first weeks in September.

        This last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some accounts which others have published since that shall be seen, wherein they say that the dead lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly false; at least, if it had been anywhere so, it must have been in houses where the living were gone from the dead (having found means, as I have observed, to escape) and where no notice was given to the officers. All which amounts to nothing at all in the case in hand; for this I am positive in, having myself been employed a little in the direction of that part in the parish in which I lived, and where as great a desolation was made in proportion to the number of inhabitants as was anywhere; I say, I am sure that there were no dead bodies remained unburied; that is to say, none that the proper officers knew of; none for want of people to carry them off, and buriers to put them into the ground and cover them; and this is sufficient to the argument; for what might lie in houses and holes, as in Moses and Aaron Alley, is nothing; for it is most certain they were buried as soon as they were found. As to the first article (namely, of provisions, the scarcity or dearness), though I have mentioned it before and shall speak of it again, yet I must observe here:—

         (1) The price of bread in particular was not much raised; for in the beginning of the year, viz., in the first week in March, the penny wheaten loaf was ten ounces and a half; and in the height of the contagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a half, and never dearer, no, not all that season. And about the beginning of November it was sold ten ounces and a half again; the like of which, I believe, was never heard of in any city, under so dreadful a visitation, before.

         (2) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) any want of bakers or ovens kept open to supply the people with the bread; but this was indeed alleged by some families, viz., that their maidservants, going to the bakehouses with their dough to be baked, which was then the custom, sometimes came home with the sickness (that is to say the plague) upon them.

        In all this dreadful visitation there were, as I have said before, but two pest-houses made use of, viz., one in the fields beyond Old Street and one in Westminster; neither was there any compulsion used in carrying people thither. Indeed there was no need of compulsion in the case, for there were thousands of poor distressed people who, having no help or conveniences or supplies but of charity, would have been very glad to have been carried thither and been taken care of; which, indeed, was the only thing that I think was wanting in the whole public management of the city, seeing nobody was here allowed to be brought to the pest-house but where money was given, or security for money, either at their introducing or upon their being cured and sent out—for very many were sent out again whole; and very good physicians were appointed to those places, so that many people did very well there, of which I shall make mention again. The principal sort of people sent thither were, as I have said, servants who got the distemper by going on errands to fetch necessaries to the families where they lived, and who in that case, if they came home sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the house; and they were so well looked after there in all the time of the visitation that there was but 156 buried in all at the London pest-house, and 159 at that of Westminster.

        By having more pest-houses I am far from meaning a forcing all people into such places. Had the shutting up of houses been omitted and the sick hurried out of their dwellings to pest-houses, as some proposed, it seems, at that time as well as since, it would certainly have been much worse than it was. The very removing the sick would have been a spreading of the infection, and rather because that removing could not effectually clear the house where the sick person was of the distemper; and the rest of the family, being then left at liberty, would certainly spread it among others.

        The methods also in private families, which would have been universally used to have concealed the distemper and to have concealed the persons being sick, would have been such that the distemper would sometimes have seized a whole family before any visitors or examiners could have known of it. On the other hand, the prodigious numbers which would have been sick at a time would have exceeded all the capacity of public pest-houses to receive them, or of public officers to discover and remove them.

        This was well considered in those days, and I have heard them talk of it often. The magistrates had enough to do to bring people to submit to having their houses shut up, and many ways they deceived the watchmen and got out, as I have observed. But that difficulty made it apparent that they would have found it impracticable to have gone the other way to work, for they could never have forced the sick people out of their beds and out of their dwellings. It must not have been my Lord Mayor's officers, but an army of officers, that must have attempted it; and the people, on the other hand, would have been enraged and desperate, and would have killed those that should have offered to have meddled with them or with their children and relations, whatever had befallen them for it; so that they would have made the people, who, as it was, were in the most terrible distraction imaginable, I say, they would have made them stark mad; whereas the magistrates found it proper on several accounts to treat them with lenity and compassion, and not with violence and terror, such as dragging the sick out of their houses or obliging them to remove themselves, would have been.

        This leads me again to mention the time when the plague first began; that is to say, when it became certain that it would spread over the whole town, when, as I have said, the better sort of people first took the alarm and began to hurry themselves out of town. It was true, as I observed in its place, that the throng was so great, and the coaches, horses, waggons, and carts were so many, driving and dragging the people away, that it looked as if all the city was running away; and had any regulations been published that had been terrifying at that time, especially such as would pretend to dispose of the people otherwise than they would dispose of themselves, it would have put both the city and suburbs into the utmost confusion.

        But the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged, made very good bye-laws for the regulating the citizens, keeping good order in the streets, and making everything as eligible as possible to all sorts of people.

In the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, the Court of Aldermen, and a certain number of the Common Council men, or their deputies, came to a resolution and published it, viz., that they would not quit the city themselves, but that they would be always at hand for the preserving good order in every place and for the doing justice on all occasions; as also for the distributing the public charity to the poor; and, in a word, for the doing the duty and discharging the trust reposed in them by the citizens to the utmost of their power.

        In pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, &c., held councils every day, more or less, for making such dispositions as they found needful for preserving the civil peace; and though they used the people with all possible gentleness and clemency, yet all manner of presumptuous rogues such as thieves, housebreakers, plunderers of the dead or of the sick, were duly punished, and several declarations were continually published by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen against such.

        Also all constables and churchwardens were enjoined to stay in the city upon severe penalties, or to depute such able and sufficient housekeepers as the deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the precinct should approve, and for whom they should give security; and also security in case of mortality that they would forthwith constitute other constables in their stead.

        These things re-established the minds of the people very much, especially in the first of their fright, when they talked of making so universal a flight that the city would have been in danger of being entirely deserted of its inhabitants except the poor, and the country of being plundered and laid waste by the multitude. Nor were the magistrates deficient in performing their part as boldly as they promised it; for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs were continually in the streets and at places of the greatest danger, and though they did not care for having too great a resort of people crowding about them, yet in emergent cases they never denied the people access to them, and heard with patience all their grievances and complaints. My Lord Mayor had a low gallery built on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little removed from the crowd when any complaint came to be heard, that he might appear with as much safety as possible.

        Likewise the proper officers, called my Lord Mayor's officers, constantly attended in their turns, as they were in waiting; and if any of them were sick or infected, as some of them were, others were instantly employed to fill up and officiate in their places till it was known whether the other should live or die.

        In like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several stations and wards, where they were placed by office, and the sheriff's officers or sergeants were appointed to receive orders from the respective aldermen in their turn, so that justice was executed in all cases without interruption. In the next place, it was one of their particular cares to see the orders for the freedom of the markets observed, and in this part either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the sheriffs were every market-day on horseback to see their orders executed and to see that the country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in their coming to the markets and going back again, and that no nuisances or frightful objects should be seen in the streets to terrify them or make them unwilling to come. Also the bakers were taken under particular order, and the Master of the Bakers' Company was, with his court of assistants, directed to see the order of my Lord Mayor for their regulation put in execution, and the due assize of bread (which was weekly appointed by my Lord Mayor) observed; and all the bakers were obliged to keep their oven going constantly, on pain of losing the privileges of a freeman of the city of London.

        By this means bread was always to be had in plenty, and as cheap as usual, as I said above; and provisions were never wanting in the markets, even to such a degree that I often wondered at it, and reproached myself with being so timorous and cautious in stirring abroad, when the country people came freely and boldly to market, as if there had been no manner of infection in the city, or danger of catching it.

        It was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said magistrates that the streets were kept constantly clear and free from all manner of frightful objects, dead bodies, or any such things as were indecent or unpleasant—unless where anybody fell down suddenly or died in the streets, as I have said above; and these were generally covered with some cloth or blanket, or removed into the next churchyard till night. All the needful works that carried terror with them, that were both dismal and dangerous, were done in the night; if any diseased bodies were removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes burnt, it was done in the night; and all the bodies which were thrown into the great pits in the several churchyards or burying-grounds, as has been observed, were so removed in the night, and everything was covered and closed before day. So that in the daytime there was not the least signal of the calamity to be seen or heard of, except what was to be observed from the emptiness of the streets, and sometimes from the passionate outcries and lamentations of the people, out at their windows, and from the numbers of houses and shops shut up.

        Nor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so much in the city as in the out-parts, except just at one particular time when, as I have mentioned, the plague came east and spread over all the city. It was indeed a merciful disposition of God, that as the plague began at one end of the town first (as has been observed at large) so it proceeded progressively to other parts, and did not come on this way, or eastward, till it had spent its fury in the West part of the town; and so, as it came on one way, it abated another. For example, it began at St Giles's and the Westminster end of the town, and it was in its height in all that part by about the middle of July, viz., in St Giles-in-the-Fields, St Andrew's, Holborn, St Clement Danes, St Martin-in-the-Fields, and in Westminster. The latter end of July it decreased in those parishes; and coming east, it increased prodigiously in Cripplegate, St Sepulcher's, St James's, Clarkenwell, and St Bride's and Aldersgate. While it was in all these parishes, the city and all the parishes of the Southwark side of the water and all Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Wapping, and Ratcliff, were very little touched; so that people went about their business unconcerned, carried on their trades, kept open their shops, and conversed freely with one another in all the city, the east and north-east suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as if the plague had not been among us.

        Even when the north and north-west suburbs were fully infected, viz., Cripplegate, Clarkenwell, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, yet still all the rest were tolerably well. For example from 25th July to 1st August the bill stood thus of all diseases:—

St Giles, Cripplegate                                             554
St Sepulchers                                                       250
Clarkenwell                                                           103
Bishopsgate                                                         116
Shoreditch                                                           110
Stepney parish                                                      127
Aldgate                                                                  92
Whitechappel                                                        104
All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls         228
All the parishes in Southwark                                 205
-                                                                           ——-
-                                                                        Total 1889
        So that, in short, there died more that week in the two parishes of Cripplegate and St Sepulcher by forty-eight than in all the city, all the east suburbs, and all the Southwark parishes put together. This caused the reputation of the city's health to continue all over England—and especially in the counties and markets adjacent, from whence our supply of provisions chiefly came even much longer than that health itself continued; for when the people came into the streets from the country by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and Smithfield, they would see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops shut, and the few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the streets. But when they came within the city, there things looked better, and the markets and shops were open, and the people walking about the streets as usual, though not quite so many; and this continued till the latter end of August and the beginning of September.

        But then the case altered quite; the distemper abated in the west and north-west parishes, and the weight of the infection lay on the city and the eastern suburbs, and the Southwark side, and this in a frightful manner. Then, indeed, the city began to look dismal, shops to be shut, and the streets desolate. In the High Street, indeed, necessity made people stir abroad on many occasions; and there would be in the middle of the day a pretty many people, but in the mornings and evenings scarce any to be seen, even there, no, not in Cornhill and Cheapside.

        These observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the weekly bills of mortality for those weeks, an abstract of which, as they respect the parishes which. I have mentioned and as they make the calculations I speak of very evident, take as follows.

        The weekly bill, which makes out this decrease of the burials in the west and north side of the city, stands thus—
From the 12th of September to the 19th—
-St Giles, Cripplegate                                                       456
-St Giles-in-the-Fields                                                       140
-Clarkenwell                                                                       77
-St Sepulcher                                                                    214
-St Leonard, Shoreditch                                                   183
-Stepney parish                                                                716
-Aldgate                                                                            623
-Whitechappel                                                                  532
-All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls                  1493
-In the eight parishes on Southwark side                         1636
-                                                                                      ——-
-     Total                                                                          6060

        Here is a strange change of things indeed, and a sad change it was; and had it held for two months more than it did, very few people would have been left alive. But then such, I say, was the merciful disposition of God that, when it was thus, the west and north part which had been so dreadfully visited at first, grew, as you see, much better; and as the people disappeared here, they began to look abroad again there; and the next week or two altered it still more; that is, more to the encouragement of the other part of the town. For example:—

From the 19th of September to the 26th—
-St Giles, Cripplegate                                                       277
-St Giles-in-the-Fields                                                       119
-Clarkenwell                                                                       76
-St Sepulcher                                                                    193
-St Leonard, Shoreditch                                                   146
-Stepney parish                                                                616
-Aldgate                                                                            496
-Whitechappel                                                                  346
-All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls                  1268
-In the eight parishes on Southwark side                         1390
-                                                                                      ——-
-     Total                                                                          4927

From the 26th of September to the 3rd of October—
-St Giles, Cripplegate                                                       196
-St Giles-in-the-Fields                                                       95
-Clarkenwell                                                                       48
-St Sepulcher                                                                    137
-St Leonard, Shoreditch                                                   128
-Stepney parish                                                                674
-Aldgate                                                                            372
-Whitechappel                                                                  328
-All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls                  1149
-In the eight parishes on Southwark side                         1201
-                                                                                      ——-
-     Total                                                                          4382

        And now the misery of the city and of the said east and south parts was complete indeed; for, as you see, the weight of the distemper lay upon those parts, that is to say, the city, the eight parishes over the river, with the parishes of Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney; and this was the time that the bills came up to such a monstrous height as that I mentioned before, and that eight or nine, and, as I believe, ten or twelve thousand a week, died; for it is my settled opinion that they never could come at any just account of the numbers, for the reasons which I have given already.

        Nay, one of the most eminent physicians, who has since published in Latin an account of those times, and of his observations says that in one week there died twelve thousand people, and that particularly there died four thousand in one night; though I do not         remember that there ever was any such particular night so remarkably fatal as that such a number died in it. However, all this confirms what I have said above of the uncertainty of the bills of mortality, &c., of which I shall say more hereafter.

        And here let me take leave to enter again, though it may seem a repetition of circumstances, into a description of the miserable condition of the city itself, and of those parts where I lived at this particular time. The city and those other parts, notwithstanding the great numbers of people that were gone into the country, was vastly full of people; and perhaps the fuller because people had for a long time a strong belief that the plague would not come into the city, nor into Southwark, no, nor into Wapping or Ratcliff at all; nay, such was the assurance of the people on that head that many removed from the suburbs on the west and north sides, into those eastern and south sides as for safety; and, as I verily believe, carried the plague amongst them there perhaps sooner than they would otherwise have had it.

        Here also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of posterity, concerning the manner of people's infecting one another; namely, that it was not the sick people only from whom the plague was immediately received by others that were sound, but the well. To explain myself: by the sick people I mean those who were known to be sick, had taken their beds, had been under cure, or had swellings and tumours upon them, and the like; these everybody could beware of; they were either in their beds or in such condition as could not be concealed.

        By the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it really upon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the consequences of it in their countenances: nay, even were not sensible of it themselves, as many were not for several days. These breathed death in every place, and upon everybody who came near them; nay, their very clothes retained the infection, their hands would infect the things they touched, especially if they were warm and sweaty, and they were generally apt to sweat too.

        Now it was impossible to know these people, nor did they sometimes, as I have said, know themselves to be infected. These were the people that so often dropped down and fainted in the streets; for oftentimes they would go about the streets to the last, till on a sudden they would sweat, grow faint, sit down at a door and die. It is true, finding themselves thus, they would struggle hard to get home to their own doors, or at other times would be just able to go into their houses and die instantly; other times they would go about till they had the very tokens come out upon them, and yet not know it, and would die in an hour or two after they came home, but be well as long as they were abroad. These were the dangerous people; these were the people of whom the well people ought to have been afraid; but then, on the other side, it was impossible to know them.

        And this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to prevent the spreading of the plague by the utmost human vigilance: viz., that it is impossible to know the infected people from the sound, or that the infected people should perfectly know themselves. I knew a man who conversed freely in London all the season of the plague in 1665, and kept about him an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he thought himself in any danger, and he had such a rule to know or have warning of the danger by as indeed I never met with before or since. How far it may be depended on I know not. He had a wound in his leg, and whenever he came among any people that were not sound, and the infection began to affect him, he said he could know it by that signal, viz., that his wound in his leg would smart, and look pale and white; so as soon as ever he felt it smart it was time for him to withdraw, or to take care of himself, taking his drink, which he always carried about him for that purpose. Now it seems he found his wound would smart many times when he was in company with such who thought themselves to be sound, and who appeared so to one another; but he would presently rise up and say publicly, 'Friends, here is somebody in the room that has the plague', and so would immediately break up the company. This was indeed a faithful monitor to all people that the plague is not to be avoided by those that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it when they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when they know not that they have it themselves; and in this case shutting up the well or removing the sick will not do it, unless they can go back and shut up all those that the sick had conversed with, even before they knew themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back, or where to stop; for none knows when or where or how they may have received the infection, or from whom.

        This I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of the air being corrupted and infected, and that they need not be cautious of whom they converse with, for that the contagion was in the air. I have seen them in strange agitations and surprises on this account. 'I have never come near any infected body', says the disturbed person; 'I have conversed with none but sound, healthy people, and yet I have gotten the distemper!' 'I am sure I am struck from Heaven', says another, and he falls to the serious part. Again, the first goes on exclaiming, 'I have come near no infection or any infected person; I am sure it is the air. We draw in death when we breathe, and therefore 'tis the hand of God; there is no withstanding it.' And this at last made many people, being hardened to the danger, grow less concerned at it; and less cautious towards the latter end of the time, and when it was come to its height, than they were at first. Then, with a kind of a Turkish predestinarianism, they would say, if it pleased God to strike them, it was all one whether they went abroad or stayed at home; they could not escape it, and therefore they went boldly about, even into infected houses and infected company; visited sick people; and, in short, lay in the beds with their wives or relations when they were infected. And what was the consequence, but the same that is the consequence in Turkey, and in those countries where they do those things—namely, that they were infected too, and died by hundreds and thousands?

        I would be far from lessening the awe of the judgements of God and the reverence to His providence which ought always to be on our minds on such occasions as these. Doubtless the visitation itself is a stroke from Heaven upon a city, or country, or nation where it falls; a messenger of His vengeance, and a loud call to that nation or country or city to humiliation and repentance, according to that of the prophet Jeremiah (xviii. 7, 8): 'At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.' Now to prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the minds of men on such occasions, and not to lessen them, it is that I have left those minutes upon record.

        I say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of those things upon the immediate hand of God, and the appointment and direction of His providence; nay, on the contrary, there were many wonderful deliverances of persons from infection, and deliverances of persons when infected, which intimate singular and remarkable providence in the particular instances to which they refer; and I esteem my own deliverance to be one next to miraculous, and do record it with thankfulness.

        But when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising from natural causes, we must consider it as it was really propagated by natural means; nor is it at all the less a judgement for its being under the conduct of human causes and effects; for, as the Divine Power has formed the whole scheme of nature and maintains nature in its course, so the same Power thinks fit to let His own actings with men, whether of mercy or judgement, to go on in the ordinary course of natural causes; and He is pleased to act by those natural causes as the ordinary means, excepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a power to act in a supernatural way when He sees occasion. Now 'tis evident that in the case of an infection there is no apparent extraordinary occasion for supernatural operation, but the ordinary course of things appears sufficiently armed, and made capable of all the effects that Heaven usually directs by a contagion. Among these causes and effects, this of the secret conveyance of infection, imperceptible and unavoidable, is more than sufficient to execute the fierceness of Divine vengeance, without putting it upon supernaturals and miracle.

        The acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such, and the infection was received so imperceptibly, that the most exact caution could not secure us while in the place. But I must be allowed to believe—and I have so many examples fresh in my memory to convince me of it, that I think none can resist their evidence—I say, I must be allowed to believe that no one in this whole nation ever received the sickness or infection but who received it in the ordinary way of infection from somebody, or the clothes or touch or stench of somebody that was infected before.

        The manner of its coming first to London proves this also, viz., by goods brought over from Holland, and brought thither from the Levant; the first breaking of it out in a house in Long Acre where those goods were carried and first opened; its spreading from that house to other houses by the visible unwary conversing with those who were sick; and the infecting the parish officers who were employed about the persons dead, and the like. These are known authorities for this great foundation point—that it went on and proceeded from person to person and from house to house, and no otherwise. In the first house that was infected there died four persons. A neighbour, hearing the mistress of the first house was sick, went to visit her, and went home and gave the distemper to her family, and died, and all her household. A minister, called to pray with the first sick person in the second house, was said to sicken immediately and die with several more in his house. Then the physicians began to consider, for they did not at first dream of a general contagion. But the physicians being sent to inspect the bodies, they assured the people that it was neither more or less than the plague, with all its terrifying particulars, and that it threatened an universal infection, so many people having already conversed with the sick or distempered, and having, as might be supposed, received infection from them, that it would be impossible to put a stop to it.

        Here the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation afterwards, namely, that the danger was spreading insensibly, for the sick could infect none but those that came within reach of the sick person; but that one man who may have really received the infection and knows it not, but goes abroad and about as a sound person, may give the plague to a thousand people, and they to greater numbers in proportion, and neither the person giving the infection or the persons receiving it know anything of it, and perhaps not feel the effects of it for several days after.

        For example, many persons in the time of this visitation never perceived that they were infected till they found to their unspeakable surprise, the tokens come out upon them; after which they seldom lived six hours; for those spots they called the tokens were really gangrene spots, or mortified flesh in small knobs as broad as a little silver penny, and hard as a piece of callus or horn; so that, when the disease was come up to that length, there was nothing could follow but certain death; and yet, as I said, they knew nothing of their being infected, nor found themselves so much as out of order, till those mortal marks were upon them. But everybody must allow that they were infected in a high degree before, and must have been so some time, and consequently their breath, their sweat, their very clothes, were contagious for many days before. This occasioned a vast variety of cases which physicians would have much more opportunity to remember than I; but some came within the compass of my observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.

        A certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched till the month of September, when the weight of the distemper lay more in the city than it had done before, was mighty cheerful, and something too bold (as I think it was) in his talk of how secure he was, how cautious he had been, and how he had never come near any sick body. Says another citizen, a neighbour of his, to him one day, 'Do not be too confident, Mr—; it is hard to say who is sick and who is well, for we see men alive and well to outward appearance one hour, and dead the next.' 'That is true', says the first man, for he was not a man presumptuously secure, but had escaped a long while—and men, as I said above, especially in the city began to be over-easy upon that score. 'That is true,' says he; 'I do not think myself secure, but I hope I have not been in company with any person that there has been any danger in.' 'No?' says his neighbour. 'Was not you at the Bull Head Tavern in Gracechurch Street with Mr—the night before last?' 'Yes,' says the first, 'I was; but there was nobody there that we had any reason to think dangerous.' Upon which his neighbour said no more, being unwilling to surprise him; but this made him more inquisitive, and as his neighbour appeared backward, he was the more impatient, and in a kind of warmth says he aloud, 'Why, he is not dead, is he?' Upon which his neighbour still was silent, but cast up his eyes and said something to himself; at which the first citizen turned pale, and said no more but this, 'Then I am a dead man too', and went home immediately and sent for a neighbouring apothecary to give him something preventive, for he had not yet found himself ill; but the apothecary, opening his breast, fetched a sigh, and said no more but this, 'Look up to God'; and the man died in a few hours.

        Now let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for the regulations of magistrates, either by shutting up the sick or removing them, to stop an infection which spreads itself from man to man even while they are perfectly well and insensible of its approach, and may be so for many days.

        It may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men might have the seeds of the contagion in them before it discovered itself in this fatal manner, and how long they might go about seemingly whole, and yet be contagious to all those that came near them. I believe the most experienced physicians cannot answer this question directly any more than I can; and something an ordinary observer may take notice of, which may pass their observations. The opinion of physicians abroad seems to be that it may lie dormant in the spirits or in the blood-vessels a very considerable time. Why else do they exact a quarantine of those who came into their harbours and ports from suspected places? Forty days is, one would think, too long for nature to struggle with such an enemy as this, and not conquer it or yield to it. But I could not think, by my own observation, that they can be infected so as to be contagious to others above fifteen or sixteen days at furthest; and on that score it was, that when a house was shut up in the city and any one had died of the plague, but nobody appeared to be ill in the family for sixteen or eighteen days after, they were not so strict but that they would connive at their going privately abroad; nor would people be much afraid of them afterward, but rather think they were fortified the better, having not been vulnerable when the enemy was in their own house; but we sometimes found it had lain much longer concealed.

        Upon the foot of all these observations I must say that though Providence seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise, yet it is my opinion, and I must leave it as a prescription, viz., that the best physic against the plague is to run away from it. I know people encourage themselves by saying God is able to keep us in the midst of danger, and able to overtake us when we think ourselves out of danger; and this kept thousands in the town whose carcases went into the great pits by cartloads, and who, if they had fled from the danger, had, I believe, been safe from the disaster; at least 'tis probable they had been safe.

        And were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people on any future occasion of this or the like nature, I am persuaded it would put them upon quite different measures for managing the people from those that they took in 1665, or than any that have been taken abroad that I have heard of. In a word, they would consider of separating the people into smaller bodies, and removing them in time farther from one another—and not let such a contagion as this, which is indeed chiefly dangerous to collected bodies of people, find a million of people in a body together, as was very near the case before, and would certainly be the case if it should ever appear again.

        The plague, like a great fire, if a few houses only are contiguous where it happens, can only burn a few houses; or if it begins in a single, or, as we call it, a lone house, can only burn that lone house where it begins. But if it begins in a close-built town or city and gets a head, there its fury increases: it rages over the whole place, and consumes all it can reach.

        I could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government of this city, if ever they should be under the apprehensions of such another enemy (God forbid they should), might ease themselves of the greatest part of the dangerous people that belong to them; I mean such as the begging, starving, labouring poor, and among them chiefly those who, in case of a siege, are called the useless mouths; who being then prudently and to their own advantage disposed of, and the wealthy inhabitants disposing of themselves and of their servants and children, the city and its adjacent parts would be so effectually evacuated that there would not be above a tenth part of its people left together for the disease to take hold upon. But suppose them to be a fifth part, and that two hundred and fifty thousand people were left: and if it did seize upon them, they would, by their living so much at large, be much better prepared to defend themselves against the infection, and be less liable to the effects of it than if the same number of people lived close together in one smaller city such as Dublin or Amsterdam or the like.

        It is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled away at this last plague, but then of them, many fled too late, and not only died in their flight, but carried the distemper with them into the countries where they went and infected those whom they went among for safety; which confounded the thing, and made that be a propagation of the distemper which was the best means to prevent it; and this too is an evidence of it, and brings me back to what I only hinted at before, but must speak more fully to here, namely, that men went about apparently well many days after they had the taint of the disease in their vitals, and after their spirits were so seized as that they could never escape it, and that all the while they did so they were dangerous to others; I say, this proves that so it was; for such people infected the very towns they went through, as well as the families they went among; and it was by that means that almost all the great towns in England had the distemper among them, more or less, and always they would tell you such a Londoner or such a Londoner brought it down.

        It must not be omitted that when I speak of those people who were really thus dangerous, I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of their own conditions; for if they really knew their circumstances to be such as indeed they were, they must have been a kind of wilful murtherers if they would have gone abroad among healthy people—and it would have verified indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above, and which I thought seemed untrue: viz., that the infected people were utterly careless as to giving the infection to others, and rather forward to do it than not; and I believe it was partly from this very thing that they raised that suggestion, which I hope was not really true in fact.

        I confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general, but I could name several people within the knowledge of some of their neighbours and families yet living who showed the contrary to an extreme. One man, a master of a family in my neighbourhood, having had the distemper, he thought he had it given him by a poor workman whom he employed, and whom he went to his house to see, or went for some work that he wanted to have finished; and he had some apprehensions even while he was at the poor workman's door, but did not discover it fully; but the next day it discovered itself, and he was taken very in, upon which he immediately caused himself to be carried into an outbuilding which he had in his yard, and where there was a chamber over a workhouse (the man being a brazier). Here he lay, and here he died, and would be tended by none of his neighbours, but by a nurse from abroad; and would not suffer his wife, nor children, nor servants to come up into the room, lest they should be infected—but sent them his blessing and prayers for them by the nurse, who spoke it to them at a distance, and all this for fear of giving them the distemper; and without which he knew, as they were kept up, they could not have it.

        And here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all distempers do, operated in a different manner on differing constitutions; some were immediately overwhelmed with it, and it came to violent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, pains in the back, and so up to ravings and ragings with those pains; others with swellings and tumours in the neck or groin, or armpits, which till they could be broke put them into insufferable agonies and torment; while others, as I have observed, were silently infected, the fever preying upon their spirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell into swooning, and faintings, and death without pain. I am not physician enough to enter into the particular reasons and manner of these differing effects of one and the same distemper, and of its differing operation in several bodies; nor is it my business here to record the observations which I really made, because the doctors themselves have done that part much more effectually than I can do, and because my opinion may in some things differ from theirs. I am only relating what I know, or have heard, or believe of the particular cases, and what fell within the compass of my view, and the different nature of the infection as it appeared in the particular cases which I have related; but this may be added too: that though the former sort of those cases, namely, those openly visited, were the worst for themselves as to pain—I mean those that had such fevers, vomitings, headaches, pains, and swellings, because they died in such a dreadful manner—yet the latter had the worst state of the disease; for in the former they frequently recovered, especially if the swellings broke; but the latter was inevitable death; no cure, no help, could be possible, nothing could follow but death. And it was worse also to others, because, as above, it secretly and unperceived by others or by themselves, communicated death to those they conversed with, the penetrating poison insinuating itself into their blood in a manner which it is impossible to describe, or indeed conceive.

        This infecting and being infected without so much as its being known to either person is evident from two sorts of cases which frequently happened at that time; and there is hardly anybody living who was in London during the infection but must have known several of the cases of both sorts.

         (1) Fathers and mothers have gone about as if they had been well, and have believed themselves to be so, till they have insensibly infected and been the destruction of their whole families, which they would have been far from doing if they had the least apprehensions of their being unsound and dangerous themselves. A family, whose story I have heard, was thus infected by the father; and the distemper began to appear upon some of them even before he found it upon himself. But searching more narrowly, it appeared he had been affected some time; and as soon as he found that his family had been poisoned by himself he went distracted, and would have laid violent hands upon himself, but was kept from that by those who looked to him, and in a few days died.

         (2) The other particular is, that many people having been well to the best of their own judgement, or by the best observation which they could make of themselves for several days, and only finding a decay of appetite, or a light sickness upon their stomachs; nay, some whose appetite has been strong, and even craving, and only a light pain in their heads, have sent for physicians to know what ailed them, and have been found, to their great surprise, at the brink of death: the tokens upon them, or the plague grown up to an incurable height.

        It was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last mentioned above had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week or a fortnight before that; how he had ruined those that he would have hazarded his life to save, and had been breathing death upon them, even perhaps in his tender kissing and embracings of his own children. Yet thus certainly it was, and often has been, and I could give many particular cases where it has been so. If then the blow is thus insensibly striking—if the arrow flies thus unseen, and cannot be discovered—to what purpose are all the schemes for shutting up or removing the sick people? Those schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear to be sick, or to be infected; whereas there are among them at the same time thousands of people who seem to be well, but are all that while carrying death with them into all companies which they come into.

        This frequently puzzled our physicians, and especially the apothecaries and surgeons, who knew not how to discover the sick from the sound; they all allowed that it was really so, that many people had the plague in their very blood, and preying upon their spirits, and were in themselves but walking putrefied carcases whose breath was infectious and their sweat poison, and yet were as well to look on as other people, and even knew it not themselves; I say, they all allowed that it was really true in fact, but they knew not how to propose a discovery.

        My friend Dr Heath was of opinion that it might be known by the smell of their breath; but then, as he said, who durst smell to that breath for his information? since, to know it, he must draw the stench of the plague up into his own brain, in order to distinguish the smell! I have heard it was the opinion of others that it might be distinguished by the party's breathing upon a piece of glass, where, the breath condensing, there might living creatures be seen by a microscope, of strange, monstrous, and frightful shapes, such as dragons, snakes, serpents, and devils, horrible to behold. But this I very much question the truth of, and we had no microscopes at that time, as I remember, to make the experiment with.

        It was the opinion also of another learned man, that the breath of such a person would poison and instantly kill a bird; not only a small bird, but even a cock or hen, and that, if it did not immediately kill the latter, it would cause them to be roupy, as they call it; particularly that if they had laid any eggs at any time, they would be all rotten. But those are opinions which I never found supported by any experiments, or heard of others that had seen it; so I leave them as I find them; only with this remark, namely, that I think the probabilities are very strong for them.

        Some have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon warm water, and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it, or upon several other things, especially such as are of a glutinous substance and are apt to receive a scum and support it.

        But from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was such that it was impossible to discover it at all, or to prevent its spreading from one to another by any human skill.

        Here was indeed one difficulty which I could never thoroughly get over to this time, and which there is but one way of answering that I know of, and it is this, viz., the first person that died of the plague was on December 20, or thereabouts, 1664, and in or about long Acre; whence the first person had the infection was generally said to be from a parcel of silks imported from Holland, and first opened in that house.

        But after this we heard no more of any person dying of the plague, or of the distemper being in that place, till the 9th of February, which was about seven weeks after, and then one more was buried out of the same house. Then it was hushed, and we were perfectly easy as to the public for a great while; for there were no more entered in the weekly bill to be dead of the plague till the 22nd of April, when there was two more buried, not out of the same house, but out of the same street; and, as near as I can remember, it was out of the next house to the first. This was nine weeks asunder, and after this we had no more till a fortnight, and then it broke out in several streets and spread every way. Now the question seems to lie thus: Where lay the seeds of the infection all this while? How came it to stop so long, and not stop any longer? Either the distemper did not come immediately by contagion from body to body, or, if it did, then a body may be capable to continue infected without the disease discovering itself many days, nay, weeks together; even not a quarantine of days only, but soixantine; not only forty days, but sixty days or longer.

        It is true there was, as I observed at first, and is well known to many yet living, a very cold winter and a long frost which continued three months; and this, the doctors say, might check the infection; but then the learned must allow me to say that if, according to their notion, the disease was (as I may say) only frozen up, it would like a frozen river have returned to its usual force and current when it thawed—whereas the principal recess of this infection, which was from February to April, was after the frost was broken and the weather mild and warm.

        But there is another way of solving all this difficulty, which I think my own remembrance of the thing will supply; and that is, the fact is not granted—namely, that there died none in those long intervals, viz., from the 20th of December to the 9th of February, and from thence to the 22nd of April. The weekly bills are the only evidence on the other side, and those bills were not of credit enough, at least with me, to support an hypothesis or determine a question of such importance as this; for it was our received opinion at that time, and I believe upon very good grounds, that the fraud lay in the parish officers, searchers, and persons appointed to give account of the dead, and what diseases they died of; and as people were very loth at first to have the neighbours believe their houses were infected, so they gave money to procure, or otherwise procured, the dead persons to be returned as dying of other distempers; and this I know was practised afterwards in many places, I believe I might say in all places where the distemper came, as will be seen by the vast increase of the numbers placed in the weekly bills under other articles of diseases during the time of the infection. For example, in the months of July and August, when the plague was coming on to its highest pitch, it was very ordinary to have from a thousand to twelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen hundred a week of other distempers. Not that the numbers of those distempers were really increased to such a degree, but the great number of families and houses where really the infection was, obtained the favour to have their dead be returned of other distempers, to prevent the shutting up their houses. For example:—

        Now it was not doubted but the greatest part of these, or a great part of them, were dead of the plague, but the officers were prevailed with to return them as above, and the numbers of some particular articles of distempers discovered is as follows:—

-         Aug.       Aug.       Aug.       Aug.       Aug.       Sept.      Sept.      Sept.

-       663       743         699        780         727         602          580       481

        There were several other articles which bore a proportion to these, and which, it is easy to perceive, were increased on the same account, as aged, consumptions, vomitings, imposthumes, gripes, and the like, many of which were not doubted to be infected people; but as it was of the utmost consequence to families not to be known to be infected, if it was possible to avoid it, so they took all the measures they could to have it not believed, and if any died in their houses, to get them returned to the examiners, and by the searchers, as having died of other distempers.

        This, I say, will account for the long interval which, as I have said, was between the dying of the first persons that were returned in the bill to be dead of the plague and the time when the distemper spread openly and could not be concealed.

        Besides, the weekly bills themselves at that time evidently discover the truth; for, while there was no mention of the plague, and no increase after it had been mentioned, yet it was apparent that there was an increase of those distempers which bordered nearest upon it; for example, there were eight, twelve, seventeen of the spotted fever in a week, when there were none, or but very few, of the plague; whereas before, one, three, or four were the ordinary weekly numbers of that distemper. Likewise, as I observed before, the burials increased weekly in that particular parish and the parishes adjacent more than in any other parish, although there were none set down of the plague; all which tells us, that the infection was handed on, and the succession of the distemper really preserved, though it seemed to us at that time to be ceased, and to come again in a manner surprising.

        It might be, also, that the infection might remain in other parts of the same parcel of goods which at first it came in, and which might not be perhaps opened, or at least not fully, or in the clothes of the first infected person; for I cannot think that anybody could be seized with the contagion in a fatal and mortal degree for nine weeks together, and support his state of health so well as even not to discover it to themselves; yet if it were so, the argument is the stronger in favour of what I am saying: namely, that the infection is retained in bodies apparently well, and conveyed from them to those they converse with, while it is known to neither the one nor the other.

        Great were the confusions at that time upon this very account, and when people began to be convinced that the infection was received in this surprising manner from persons apparently well, they began to be exceeding shy and jealous of every one that came near them. Once, on a public day, whether a Sabbath-day or not I do not remember, in Aldgate Church, in a pew full of people, on a sudden one fancied she smelt an ill smell. Immediately she fancies the plague was in the pew, whispers her notion or suspicion to the next, then rises and goes out of the pew. It immediately took with the next, and so to them all; and every one of them, and of the two or three adjoining pews, got up and went out of the church, nobody knowing what it was offended them, or from whom.

        This immediately filled everybody's mouths with one preparation or other, such as the old woman directed, and some perhaps as physicians directed, in order to prevent infection by the breath of others; insomuch that if we came to go into a church when it was anything full of people, there would be such a mixture of smells at the entrance that it was much more strong, though perhaps not so wholesome, than if you were going into an apothecary's or druggist's shop. In a word, the whole church was like a smelling-bottle; in one corner it was all perfumes; in another, aromatics, balsamics, and variety of drugs and herbs; in another, salts and spirits, as every one was furnished for their own preservation. Yet I observed that after people were possessed, as I have said, with the belief, or rather assurance, of the infection being thus carried on by persons apparently in health, the churches and meeting-houses were much thinner of people than at other times before that they used to be. For this is to be said of the people of London, that during the whole time of the pestilence the churches or meetings were never wholly shut up, nor did the people decline coming out to the public worship of God, except only in some parishes when the violence of the distemper was more particularly in that parish at that time, and even then no longer than it continued to be so.

        Indeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the people went to the public service of God, even at that time when they were afraid to stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion; this, I mean, before the time of desperation, which I have mentioned already. This was a proof of the exceeding populousness of the city at the time of the infection, notwithstanding the great numbers that were gone into the country at the first alarm, and that fled out into the forests and woods when they were further terrified with the extraordinary increase of it. For when we came to see the crowds and throngs of people which appeared on the Sabbath-days at the churches, and especially in those parts of the town where the plague was abated, or where it was not yet come to its height, it was amazing. But of this I shall speak again presently. I return in the meantime to the article of infecting one another at first, before people came to right notions of the infection, and of infecting one another. People were only shy of those that were really sick, a man with a cap upon his head, or with clothes round his neck, which was the case of those that had swellings there. Such was indeed frightful; but when we saw a gentleman dressed, with his band on and his gloves in his hand, his hat upon his head, and his hair combed, of such we had not the least apprehensions, and people conversed a great while freely, especially with their neighbours and such as they knew. But when the physicians assured us that the danger was as well from the sound (that is, the seemingly sound) as the sick, and that those people who thought themselves entirely free were oftentimes the most fatal, and that it came to be generally understood that people were sensible of it, and of the reason of it; then, I say, they began to be jealous of everybody, and a vast number of people locked themselves up, so as not to come abroad into any company at all, nor suffer any that had been abroad in promiscuous company to come into their houses, or near them—at least not so near them as to be within the reach of their breath or of any smell from them; and when they were obliged to converse at a distance with strangers, they would always have preservatives in their mouths and about their clothes to repel and keep off the infection.

        It must be acknowledged that when people began to use these cautions they were less exposed to danger, and the infection did not break into such houses so furiously as it did into others before; and thousands of families were preserved (speaking with due reserve to the direction of Divine Providence) by that means.

        But it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the poor. They went on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers, full of outcries and lamentations when taken, but madly careless of themselves, foolhardy and obstinate, while they were well. Where they could get employment they pushed into any kind of business, the most dangerous and the most liable to infection; and if they were spoken to, their answer would be, 'I must trust to God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for, and there is an end of me', and the like. Or thus, 'Why, what must I do? I can't starve. I had as good have the plague as perish for want. I have no work; what could I do? I must do this or beg.' Suppose it was burying the dead, or attending the sick, or watching infected houses, which were all terrible hazards; but their tale was generally the same. It is true, necessity was a very justifiable, warrantable plea, and nothing could be better; but their way of talk was much the same where the necessities were not the same. This adventurous conduct of the poor was that which brought the plague among them in a most furious manner; and this, joined to the distress of their circumstances when taken, was the reason why they died so by heaps; for I cannot say I could observe one jot of better husbandry among them, I mean the labouring poor, while they were all well and getting money than there was before, but as lavish, as extravagant, and as thoughtless for tomorrow as ever; so that when they came to be taken sick they were immediately in the utmost distress, as well for want as for sickness, as well for lack of food as lack of health.

        This misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eyewitness of, and sometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious people daily gave to such, sending them relief and supplies both of food, physic, and other help, as they found they wanted; and indeed it is a debt of justice due to the temper of the people of that day to take notice here, that not only great sums, very great sums of money were charitably sent to the Lord Mayor and aldermen for the assistance and support of the poor distempered people, but abundance of private people daily distributed large sums of money for their relief, and sent people about to inquire into the condition of particular distressed and visited families, and relieved them; nay, some pious ladies were so transported with zeal in so good a work, and so confident in the protection of Providence in discharge of the great duty of charity, that they went about in person distributing alms to the poor, and even visiting poor families, though sick and infected, in their very houses, appointing nurses to attend those that wanted attending, and ordering apothecaries and surgeons, the first to supply them with drugs or plasters, and such things as they wanted; and the last to lance and dress the swellings and tumours, where such were wanting; giving their blessing to the poor in substantial relief to them, as well as hearty prayers for them.

        I will not undertake to say, as some do, that none of those charitable people were suffered to fall under the calamity itself; but this I may say, that I never knew any one of them that miscarried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in case of the like distress; and doubtless, if they that give to the poor lend to the Lord, and He will repay them, those that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and assist the poor in such a misery as this, may hope to be protected in the work.

        Nor was this charity so extraordinary eminent only in a few, but (for I cannot lightly quit this point) the charity of the rich, as well in the city and suburbs as from the country, was so great that, in a word, a prodigious number of people who must otherwise inevitably have perished for want as well as sickness were supported and subsisted by it; and though I could never, nor I believe any one else, come to a full knowledge of what was so contributed, yet I do believe that, as I heard one say that was a critical observer of that part, there was not only many thousand pounds contributed, but many hundred thousand pounds, to the relief of the poor of this distressed, afflicted city; nay, one man affirmed to me that he could reckon up above one hundred thousand pounds a week, which was distributed by the churchwardens at the several parish vestries by the Lord Mayor and aldermen in the several wards and precincts, and by the particular direction of the court and of the justices respectively in the parts where they resided, over and above the private charity distributed by pious bands in the manner I speak of; and this continued for many weeks together.

        I confess this is a very great sum; but if it be true that there was distributed in the parish of Cripplegate only, 17,800 in one week to the relief of the poor, as I heard reported, and which I really believe was true, the other may not be improbable.

        It was doubtless to be reckoned among the many signal good providences which attended this great city, and of which there were many other worth recording,—I say, this was a very remarkable one, that it pleased God thus to move the hearts of the people in all parts of the kingdom so cheerfully to contribute to the relief and support of the poor at London, the good consequences of which were felt many ways, and particularly in preserving the lives and recovering the health of so many thousands, and keeping so many thousands of families from perishing and starving.

        And now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in this time of calamity, I cannot but mention again, though I have spoken several times of it already on other accounts, I mean that of the progression of the distemper; how it began at one end of the town, and proceeded gradually and slowly from one part to another, and like a dark cloud that passes over our heads, which, as it thickens and overcasts the air at one end, dears up at the other end; so, while the plague went on raging from west to east, as it went forwards east, it abated in the west, by which means those parts of the town which were not seized, or who were left, and where it had spent its fury, were (as it were) spared to help and assist the other; whereas, had the distemper spread itself over the whole city and suburbs, at once, raging in all places alike, as it has done since in some places abroad, the whole body of the people must have been overwhelmed, and there would have died twenty thousand a day, as they say there did at Naples; nor would the people have been able to have helped or assisted one another.

        For it must be observed that where the plague was in its full force, there indeed the people were very miserable, and the consternation was inexpressible. But a little before it reached even to that place, or presently after it was gone, they were quite another sort of people; and I cannot but acknowledge that there was too much of that common temper of mankind to be found among us all at that time, namely, to forget the deliverance when the danger is past. But I shall come to speak of that part again.

        It must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of trade during the time of this common calamity, and this with respect to foreign trade, as also to our home trade.

        As to foreign trade, there needs little to be said. The trading nations of Europe were all afraid of us; no port of France, or Holland, or Spain, or Italy would admit our ships or correspond with us; indeed we stood on ill terms with the Dutch, and were in a furious war with them, but though in a bad condition to fight abroad, who had such dreadful enemies to struggle with at home.

        Our merchants were accordingly at a full stop; their ships could go nowhere—that is to say, to no place abroad; their manufactures and merchandise—that is to say, of our growth—would not be touched abroad. They were as much afraid of our goods as they were of our people; and indeed they had reason: for our woollen manufactures are as retentive of infection as human bodies, and if packed up by persons infected, would receive the infection and be as dangerous to touch as a man would be that was infected; and therefore, when any English vessel arrived in foreign countries, if they did take the goods on shore, they always caused the bales to be opened and aired in places appointed for that purpose. But from London they would not suffer them to come into port, much less to unlade their goods, upon any terms whatever, and this strictness was especially used with them in Spain and Italy. In Turkey and the islands of the Arches indeed, as they are called, as well those belonging to the Turks as to the Venetians, they were not so very rigid. In the first there was no obstruction at all; and four ships which were then in the river loading for Italy—that is, for Leghorn and Naples—being denied product, as they call it, went on to Turkey, and were freely admitted to unlade their cargo without any difficulty; only that when they arrived there, some of their cargo was not fit for sale in that country; and other parts of it being consigned to merchants at Leghorn, the captains of the ships had no right nor any orders to dispose of the goods; so that great inconveniences followed to the merchants. But this was nothing but what the necessity of affairs required, and the merchants at Leghorn and Naples having notice given them, sent again from thence to take care of the effects which were particularly consigned to those ports, and to bring back in other ships such as were improper for the markets at Smyrna and Scanderoon.

        The inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater, for they would by no means suffer our ships, especially those from London, to come into any of their ports, much less to unlade. There was a report that one of our ships having by stealth delivered her cargo, among which was some bales of English cloth, cotton, kerseys, and such-like goods, the Spaniards caused all the goods to be burned, and punished the men with death who were concerned in carrying them on shore. This, I believe, was in part true, though I do not affirm it; but it is not at all unlikely, seeing the danger was really very great, the infection being so violent in London.

        I heard likewise that the plague was carried into those countries by some of our ships, and particularly to the port of Faro in the kingdom of Algarve, belonging to the King of Portugal, and that several persons died of it there; but it was not confirmed.

        On the other hand, though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so shy of us, it is most certain that the plague (as has been said) keeping at first much at that end of the town next Westminster, the merchandising part of the town (such as the city and the water-side) was perfectly sound till at least the beginning of July, and the ships in the river till the beginning of August; for to the 1st of July there had died but seven within the whole city, and but sixty within the liberties, but one in all the parishes of Stepney, Aldgate, and Whitechappel, and but two in the eight parishes of Southwark. But it was the same thing abroad, for the bad news was gone over the whole world that the city of London was infected with the plague, and there was no inquiring there how the infection proceeded, or at which part of the town it was begun or was reached to.

        Besides, after it began to spread it increased so fast, and the bills grew so high all on a sudden, that it was to no purpose to lessen the report of it, or endeavour to make the people abroad think it better than it was; the account which the weekly bills gave in was sufficient; and that there died two thousand to three or four thousand a week was sufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the world; and the following time, being so dreadful also in the very city itself, put the whole world, I say, upon their guard against it.

        You may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost nothing in the carriage. The plague was itself very terrible, and the distress of the people very great, as you may observe of what I have said. But the rumour was infinitely greater, and it must not be wondered that our friends abroad (as my brother's correspondents in particular were told there, namely, in Portugal and Italy, where he chiefly traded) [said] that in London there died twenty thousand in a week; that the dead bodies lay unburied by heaps; that the living were not sufficient to bury the dead or the sound to look after the sick; that all the kingdom was infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady such as was never heard of in those parts of the world; and they could hardly believe us when we gave them an account how things really were, and how there was not above one-tenth part of the people dead; that there was 500,000, left that lived all the time in the town; that now the people began to walk the streets again, and those who were fled to return, there was no miss of the usual throng of people in the streets, except as every family might miss their relations and neighbours, and the like. I say they could not believe these things; and if inquiry were now to be made in Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they would tell you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years ago, in which, as above, there died twenty thousand in a week, &c., just as we have had it reported in London that there was a plague in the city of Naples in the year 1656, in which there died 20,000 people in a day, of which I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false.

        But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade, as well as unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long time after the plague was quite over before our trade could recover itself in those parts of the world; and the Flemings and Dutch (but especially the last) made very great advantages of it, having all the market to themselves, and even buying our manufactures in several parts of England where the plague was not, and carrying them to Holland and Flanders, and from thence transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if they had been of their own making.

        But they were detected sometimes and punished: that is to say, their goods confiscated and ships also; for if it was true that our manufactures as well as our people were infected, and that it was dangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them, then those people ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not only of carrying the contagion into their own country, but also of infecting the nations to whom they traded with those goods; which, considering how many lives might be lost in consequence of such an action, must be a trade that no men of conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in.

        I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of that kind, by those people. But I doubt I need not make any such proviso in the case of our own country; for either by our people of London, or by the commerce which made their conversing with all sorts of people in every country and of every considerable town necessary, I say, by this means the plague was first or last spread all over the kingdom, as well in London as in all the cities and great towns, especially in the trading manufacturing towns and seaports; so that, first or last, all the considerable places in England were visited more or less, and the kingdom of Ireland in some places, but not so universally. How it fared with the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire.

        It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in London, the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great trade, especially to the adjacent countries and to our own plantations. For example, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, and Hun, on that side of England, exported to Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the adjacent countries for several months after the trade with London was, as it were, entirely shut up; likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter, with the port of Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to the Canaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly to Ireland; but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in London to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all or most of those cities and towns were infected first or last; and then trade was, as it were, under a general embargo or at a full stop—as I shall observe further when I speak of our home trade.

        One thing, however, must be observed: that as to ships coming in from abroad (as many, you may be sure, did) some who were out in all parts of the world a considerable while before, and some who when they went out knew nothing of an infection, or at least of one so terrible—these came up the river boldly, and delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to do, except just in the two months of August and September, when the weight of the infection lying, as I may say, all below Bridge, nobody durst appear in business for a while. But as this continued but for a few weeks, the homeward-bound ships, especially such whose cargoes were not liable to spoil, came to an anchor for a time short of the Pool,* or fresh-water part of the river, even as low as the river Medway, where several of them ran in; and others lay at the Nore, and in the Hope below Gravesend. So that by the latter end of October there was a very great fleet of homeward-bound ships to come up, such as the like had not been known for many years.

* That part of the river where the ships lie up when they
come home is called the Pool, and takes in all the river on
both sides of the water, from the Tower to Cuckold's Point
and Limehouse. [Footnote in the original.]

        Two particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the while of the infection, and that with little or no interruption, very much to the advantage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the city: and those were the coasting trade for corn and the Newcastle trade for coals.

        The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from the port of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which great quantities of corn were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The other part of this corn-trade was from Lynn, in Norfolk, from Wells and Burnham, and from Yarmouth, all in the same county; and the third branch was from the river Medway, and from Milton, Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and all the other little places and ports round the coast of Kent and Essex.

        There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with corn, butter, and cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of trade, and without interruption came up to that market known still by the name of Bear Key, where they supplied the city plentifully with corn when land-carriage began to fail, and when the people began to be sick of coming from many places in the country.

        This also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the Lord Mayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from danger when they came up, causing their corn to be bought off at any time they wanted a market (which, however, was very seldom), and causing the corn-factors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with corn, that they had very little occasion to come out of their ships or vessels, the money being always carried on board to them and put into a pail of vinegar before it was carried.

        The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, without which the city would have been greatly distressed; for not in the streets only, but in private houses and families, great quantities of coals were then burnt, even all the summer long and when the weather was hottest, which was done by the advice of the physicians. Some indeed opposed it, and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a means to propagate the temper, which was a fermentation and heat already in the blood; that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all contagious distempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion was nourished and gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it were, propagated in heat.

        Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate infection—as sultry, hot weather fills the air with vermin and nourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures which breed in our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies, by the very stench of which infection may be propagated; also that heat in the air, or heat of weather, as we ordinarily call it, makes bodies relax and faint, exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and makes us more apt to receive infection, or any evil influence, be it from noxious pestilential vapours or any other thing in the air; but that the heat of fire, and especially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a quite different operation; the heat being not of the same kind, but quick and fierce, tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate all those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled and stagnated than separated and burnt up. Besides, it was alleged that the sulphurous and nitrous particles that are often found to be in the coal, with that bituminous substance which burns, are all assisting to clear and purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to breathe in after the noxious particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up.

        The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must confess, I think with good reason; and the experience of the citizens confirmed it, many houses which had constant fires kept in the rooms having never been infected at all; and I must join my experience to it, for I found the keeping good fires kept our rooms sweet and wholesome, and I do verily believe made our whole family so, more than would otherwise have been.

        But I return to the coals as a trade. It was with no little difficulty that this trade was kept open, and particularly because, as we were in an open war with I the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first took a great many of our collier-ships, which made the rest cautious, and made them to stay to come in fleets together. But after some time the capers were either afraid to take them, or their masters, the States, were afraid they should, and forbade them, lest the plague should be among them, which made them fare the better.

        For the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were ordered by my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a certain number at a time, and ordered lighters and other vessels such as the woodmongers (that is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers) furnished, to go down and take out the coals as low as Deptford and Greenwich, and some farther down.

        Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places where the ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and other places, in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale; but were then fetched away after the ships which brought them were gone, so that the seamen had no communication with the river-men, nor so much as came near one another.

        Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper getting among the colliery: that is to say among the ships, by which a great many seamen died of it; and that which was still worse was, that they carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and other places on the coast—where, especially at Newcastle and at Sunderland, it carried off a great number of people.

The making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual quantity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming up, whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do not remember, but the price of coals was exceeding dear, even as high as 4 a chalder; but it soon abated when the ships came in, and as afterwards they had a freer passage, the price was very reasonable all the rest of that year.

        The public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have calculated it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200 chalders of coals a week, if they had continued, which was indeed a very great quantity; but as it was thought necessary, nothing was spared. However, as some of the physicians cried them down, they were not kept alight above four or five days. The fires were ordered thus:—

        One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhith, and one at the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of Bridewell; one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and Gracechurch; one at the north and one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange; one at Guild Hall, and one at Blackwell Hall gate; one at the Lord Mayor's door in St Helen's, one at the west entrance into St Paul's, and one at the entrance into Bow Church. I do not remember whether there was any at the city gates, but one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by St Magnus Church.

        I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and said that there died the more people because of those fires; but I am persuaded those that say so offer no evidence to prove it, neither can I believe it on any account whatever.

        It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in England during this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates to the manufactures and the trade in the city. At the first breaking out of the infection there was, as it is easy to suppose, a very great fright among the people, and consequently a general stop of trade, except in provisions and necessaries of life; and even in those things, as there was a vast number of people fled and a very great number always sick, besides the number which died, so there could not be above two-thirds, if above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the city as used to be.

        It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit, but not of hay or grass—by which means bread was cheap, by reason of the plenty of corn. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of grass; but butter and cheese were dear for the same reason, and hay in the market just beyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at 4 pound per load. But that affected not the poor. There was a most excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, and they were the cheaper because of the want of people; but this made the poor eat them to excess, and this brought them into fluxes, griping of the guts, surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them into the plague.

        But to come to matters of trade. First, foreign exportation being stopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult, a general stop of all those manufactures followed of course which were usually brought for exportation; and though sometimes merchants abroad were importunate for goods, yet little was sent, the passages being so generally stopped that the English ships would not be admitted, as is said already, into their port.

        This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most parts of England, except in some out-ports; and even that was soon stopped, for they all had the plague in their turn. But though this was felt all over England, yet, what was still worse, all intercourse of trade for home consumption of manufactures, especially those which usually circulated through the Londoner's hands, was stopped at once, the trade of the city being stopped.

        All kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics, were, as I have said before, out of employ; and this occasioned the putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and workmen of all sorts, seeing nothing was done relating to such trades but what might be said to be absolutely necessary.

        This caused the multitude of single people in London to be unprovided for, as also families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads of those families; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery; and I must confess it is for the honour of the city of London, and will be for many ages, as long as this is to be spoken of, that they were able to supply with charitable provision the wants of so many thousands of those as afterwards fell sick and were distressed: so that it may be safely averred that nobody perished for want, at least that the magistrates had any notice given them of.

        This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would have put the people there to much greater difficulties, but that the master-workmen, clothiers and others, to the uttermost of their stocks and strength, kept on making their goods to keep the poor at work, believing that soon as the sickness should abate they would have a quick demand in proportion to the decay of their trade at that time. But as none but those masters that were rich could do thus, and that many were poor and not able, the manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly, and the poor were pinched all over England by the calamity of the city of London only.

        It is true that the next year made them full amends by another terrible calamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity impoverished and weakened the country, and by another calamity, even terrible too of its kind, enriched the country and made them again amends; for an infinite quantity of household Stuff, wearing apparel, and other things, besides whole warehouses filled with merchandise and manufactures such as come from all parts of England, were consumed in the fire of London the next year after this terrible visitation. It is incredible what a trade this made all over the whole kingdom, to make good the want and to supply that loss; so that, in short, all the manufacturing hands in the nation were set on work, and were little enough for several years to supply the market and answer the demands. All foreign markets also were empty of our goods by the stop which had been occasioned by the plague, and before an open trade was allowed again; and the prodigious demand at home falling in, joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods; so that there never was known such a trade all over England for the time as was in the first seven years after the plague, and after the fire of London.

        It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of this terrible judgement. The last week in September, the plague being come to its crisis, its fury began to assuage. I remember my friend Dr Heath, coming to see me the week before, told me he was sure that the violence of it would assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly bill of that week, which was the highest of the whole year, being 8297 of all diseases, I upbraided him with it, and asked him what he had made his judgement from. His answer, however, was not so much to seek as I thought it would have been. 'Look you,' says he, 'by the number which are at this time sick and infected, there should have been twenty thousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand, if the inveterate mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago; for then it ordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under eight or ten; and then not above one in five recovered, whereas I have observed that now not above two in five miscarry. And, observe it from me, the next bill will decrease, and you will see many more people recover than used to do; for though a vast multitude are now everywhere infected, and as many every day fall sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for the malignity of the distemper is abated';—adding that he began now to hope, nay, more than hope, that the infection had passed its crisis and was going off; and accordingly so it was, for the next week being, as I said, the last in September, the bill decreased almost two thousand.

        It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the next bill was no less than 6460, and the next to that, 5720; but still my friend's observation was just, and it did appear the people did recover faster and more in number than they used to do; and indeed, if it had not been so, what had been the condition of the city of London? For, according to my friend, there were not fewer than 60,000 people at that time infected, whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and near 40,000 recovered; whereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that number would very probably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more would have sickened; for, in a word, the whole mass of people began to sicken, and it looked as if none would escape.

        But this remark of my friend's appeared more evident in a few weeks more, for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased 1843, so that the number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next week it decreased 1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly that there was abundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and abundance fell sick every day but (as above) the malignity of the disease abated.

        Such is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is so or not all over the world, that's none of my particular business to inquire), but I saw it apparently here, that as upon the first fright of the infection they shunned one another, and fled from one another's houses and from the city with an unaccountable and, as I thought, unnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the distemper was not so catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it was not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and grew so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that they made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so much. They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumours and carbuncles upon them that were running, and consequently contagious, but ate and drank with them, nay, into their houses to visit them, and even, as I was told, into their very chambers where they lay sick.

        This I could not see rational. My friend Dr Heath allowed, and it was plain to experience, that the distemper was as catching as ever, and as many fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those that fell sick did not die; but I think that while many did die, and that at best the distemper itself was very terrible, the sores and swellings very tormenting, and the danger of death not left out of the circumstances of sickness, though not so frequent as before; all those things, together with the exceeding tediousness of the cure, the loathsomeness of the disease, and many other articles, were enough to deter any man living from a dangerous mixture with the sick people, and make them as anxious almost to avoid the infections as before.

        Nay, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the distemper frightful, and that was the terrible burning of the caustics which the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to run, without which the danger of death was very great, even to the last. Also, the insufferable torment of the swellings, which, though it might not make people raving and distracted, as they were before, and as I have given several instances of already, yet they put the patient to inexpressible torment; and those that fell into it, though they did escape with life, yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told them there was no danger, and sadly repented their rashness and folly in venturing to run into the reach of it.

        Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great many that thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply still, and though many escaped, yet many died; and at least it had this public mischief attending it, that it made the decrease of burials slower than it would otherwise have been. For as this notion ran like lightning through the city, and people's heads were possessed with it, even as soon as the first great decrease in the bills appeared, we found that the two next bills did not decrease in proportion; the reason I take to be the people's running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former cautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to practise, depending that the sickness would not reach them—or that if it did, they should not die.

        The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with all their might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them all over the city and suburbs, advising the people to continue reserved, and to use still the utmost caution in their ordinary conduct, notwithstanding the decrease of the distemper, terrifying them with the danger of bringing a relapse upon the whole city, and telling them how such a relapse might be more fatal and dangerous than the whole visitation that had been already; with many arguments and reasons to explain and prove that part to them, and which are too long to repeat here.

        But it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so possessed with the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of seeing a vast decrease in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable by any new terrors, and would not be persuaded but that the bitterness of death was past; and it was to no more purpose to talk to them than to an east wind; but they opened shops, went about streets, did business, and conversed with anybody that came in their way to converse with, whether with business or without, neither inquiring of their health or so much as being apprehensive of any danger from them, though they knew them not to be sound.

        This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had with great care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired, as it were, from all mankind, and had by that means, under God's providence, been preserved through all the heat of that infection.

        This rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people went so far that the ministers took notice to them of it at last, and laid before them both the folly and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they grew more cautious. But it had another effect, which they could not check; for as the first rumour had spread not over the city only, but into the country, it had the like effect: and the people were so tired with being so long from London, and so eager to come back, that they flocked to town without fear or forecast, and began to show themselves in the streets as if all the danger was over. It was indeed surprising to see it, for though there died still from 1000 to 1800 a week, yet the people flocked to town as if all had been well.

        The consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the very first week in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was above 3000 fell sick that week, most of them new-comers, too.

        One John Cock, a barber in St Martin's-le-Grand, was an eminent example of this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when the plague was abated. This John Cock had left the town with his whole family, and locked up his house, and was gone in the country, as many others did; and finding the plague so decreased in November that there died but 905 per week of all diseases, he ventured home again. He had in his family ten persons; that is to say, himself and wife, five children, two apprentices, and a maid-servant. He had not returned to his house above a week, and began to open his shop and carry on his trade, but the distemper broke out in his family, and within about five days they all died, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his five children, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained alive.

        But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to expect; for the malignity (as I have said) of the distemper was spent, the contagion was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on apace, and the air was clear and cold, with sharp frosts; and this increasing still, most of those that had fallen sick recovered, and the health of the city began to return. There were indeed some returns of the distemper even in the month of December, and the bills increased near a hundred; but it went off again, and so in a short while things began to return to their own channel. And wonderful it was to see how populous the city was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger could not miss the numbers that were lost. Neither was there any miss of the inhabitants as to their dwellings—few or no empty houses were to be seen, or if there were some, there was no want of tenants for them.

        I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the manners of the people had a new appearance. I doubt not but there were many that retained a sincere sense of their deliverance, and were that heartily thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so dangerous a time; it would be very uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so populous, and where the people were so devout as they were here in the time of the visitation itself; but except what of this was to be found in particular families and faces, it must be acknowledged that the general practice of the people was just as it was before, and very little difference was to be seen.

        Some, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the people declined from this very time; that the people, hardened by the danger they had been in, like seamen after a storm is over, were more wicked and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities than they were before; but I will not carry it so far neither. It would take up a history of no small length to give a particular of all the gradations by which the course of things in this city came to be restored again, and to run in their own channel as they did before.

        Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London had been; the cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln, Colchester, and other places were now visited; and the magistrates of London began to set rules for our conduct as to corresponding with those cities. It is true we could not pretend to forbid their people coming to London, because it was impossible to know them asunder; so, after many consultations, the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were obliged to drop it. All they could do was to warn and caution the people not to entertain in their houses or converse with any people who they knew came from such infected places.

        But they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of London thought themselves so plague-free now that they were past all admonitions; they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored, and that the air was like a man that had had the smallpox, not capable of being infected again. This revived that notion that the infection was all in the air, that there was no such thing as contagion from the sick people to the sound; and so strongly did this whimsy prevail among people that they ran all together promiscuously, sick and well. Not the Mahometans, who, prepossessed with the principle of predestination, value nothing of contagion, let it be in what it will, could be more obstinate than the people of London; they that were perfectly sound, and came out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into the city, made nothing of going into the same houses and chambers, nay, even into the same beds, with those that had the distemper upon them, and were not recovered.

        Some, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of their lives; an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had more work than ever, only with this difference, that more of their patients recovered; that is to say, they generally recovered, but certainly there were more people infected and fell sick now, when there did not die above a thousand or twelve hundred in a week, than there was when there died five or six thousand a week, so entirely negligent were the people at that time in the great and dangerous case of health and infection, and so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those who cautioned them for their good.

        The people being thus returned, as it were, in general, it was very strange to find that in their inquiring after their friends, some whole families were so entirely swept away that there was no remembrance of them left, neither was anybody to be found to possess or show any title to that little they had left; for in such cases what was to be found was generally embezzled and purloined, some gone one way, some another.

        It was said such abandoned effects came to the king, as the universal heir; upon which we are told, and I suppose it was in part true, that the king granted all such, as deodands, to the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen of London, to be applied to the use of the poor, of whom there were very many. For it is to be observed, that though the occasions of relief and the objects of distress were very many more in the time of the violence of the plague than now after all was over, yet the distress of the poor was more now a great deal than it was then, because all the sluices of general charity were now shut. People supposed the main occasion to be over, and so stopped their hands; whereas particular objects were still very moving, and the distress of those that were poor was very great indeed.

        Though the health of the city was now very much restored, yet foreign trade did not begin to stir, neither would foreigners admit our ships into their ports for a great while. As for the Dutch, the misunderstandings between our court and them had broken out into a war the year before, so that our trade that way was wholly interrupted; but Spain and Portugal, Italy and Barbary, as also Hamburg and all the ports in the Baltic, these were all shy of us a great while, and would not restore trade with us for many months.

        The distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed, many if not all the out-parishes were obliged to make new burying-grounds, besides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of which were continued, and remain in use to this day. But others were left off, and (which I confess I mention with some reflection) being converted into other uses or built upon afterwards, the dead bodies were disturbed, abused, dug up again, some even before the flesh of them was perished from the bones, and removed like dung or rubbish to other places. Some of those which came within the reach of my observation are as follow:

         (1) A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill, being some of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city, where abundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate, Clerkenwell, and even out of the city. This ground, as I take it, was since made a physic garden, and after that has been built upon.

         (2) A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then called, at the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch parish. It has been since made a yard for keeping hogs, and for other ordinary uses, but is quite out of use as a burying-ground.

         (3) The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was then a green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish, though many of the carts out of the city brought their dead thither also, particularly out of the parish of St All-hallows on the Wall. This place I cannot mention without much regret. It was, as I remember, about two or three years after the plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton came to be possessed of the ground. It was reported, how true I know not, that it fell to the king for want of heirs, all those who had any right to it being carried off by the pestilence, and that Sir Robert Clayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles II. But however he came by it, certain it is the ground was let out to build on, or built upon, by his order. The first house built upon it was a large fair house, still standing, which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley which, though called an alley, is as wide as a street. The houses in the same row with that house northward are built on the very same ground where the poor people were buried, and the bodies, on opening the ground for the foundations, were dug up, some of them remaining so plain to be seen that the women's skulls were distinguished by their long hair, and of others the flesh was not quite perished; so that the people began to exclaim loudly against it, and some suggested that it might endanger a return of the contagion; after which the bones and bodies, as fast as they came at them, were carried to another part of the same ground and thrown all together into a deep pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be known in that it is not built on, but is a passage to another house at the upper end of Rose Alley, just against the door of a meeting-house which has been built there many years since; and the ground is palisadoed off from the rest of the passage, in a little square; there lie the bones and remains of near two thousand bodies, carried by the dead carts to their grave in that one year.

         (4) Besides this, there was a piece of ground in Moorfields; by the going into the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which was enlarged much, though not wholly taken in on the same occasion.

         [N.B.—The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground, being at his own desire, his sister having been buried there a few years before.]

         (5) Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London to the north, even to the very edge of         Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece of ground taken in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard, and which for that very reason was left open, and is since, I suppose, taken into the same churchyard. And they had also two other burying-places in Spittlefields, one where since a chapel or tabernacle has been built for ease to this great parish, and another in Petticoat Lane.

        There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the parish of Stepney at that time: one where now stands the parish church of St Paul, Shadwell, and the other where now stands the parish church of St John's at Wapping, both which had not the names of parishes at that time, but were belonging to Stepney parish.

        I could name many more, but these coming within my particular knowledge, the circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record them. From the whole, it may be observed that they were obliged in this time of distress to take in new burying-grounds in most of the out-parishes for laying the prodigious numbers of people which died in so short a space of time; but why care was not taken to keep those places separate from ordinary uses, that so the bodies might rest undisturbed, that I cannot answer for, and must confess I think it was wrong. Who were to blame I know not.

        I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a burying-ground set apart to their use, and which they still make use of; and they had also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from their houses; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I mentioned before, had predicted the plague as a judgement, and ran naked through the streets, telling the people that it was come upon them to punish them for their sins, had his own wife died the very next day of the plague, and was carried, one of the first in the Quakers' dead-cart, to their new burying-ground.

        I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable things which occurred in the time of the infection, and particularly what passed between the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then at Oxford, and what directions were from time to time received from the Government for their conduct on this critical occasion. But really the Court concerned themselves so little, and that little they did was of so small import, that I do not see it of much moment to mention any part of it here: except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, both which I have mentioned before.

        Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their patients during the sickness, and now they came to town again nobody cared to employ them. They were called deserters, and frequently bills were set up upon their doors and written, 'Here is a doctor to be let', so that several of those physicians were fain for a while to sit still and look about them, or at least remove their dwellings, and set up in new places and among new acquaintance. The like was the case with the clergy, whom the people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses and scandalous reflections upon them, setting upon the church-door, 'Here is a pulpit to be let', or sometimes, 'to be sold', which was worse.

        It was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection, when it ceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander and reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation's peace before. It was said to be the remains of the old animosities, which had so lately involved us all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of Indemnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the Government had recommended family and personal peace upon all occasions to the whole nation.

        But it could not be obtained; and particularly after the ceasing of the plague in London, when any one that had seen the condition which the people had been in, and how they caressed one another at that time, promised to have more charity for the future, and to raise no more reproaches; I say, any one that had seen them then would have thought they would have come together with another spirit at last. But, I say, it could not be obtained. The quarrel remained; the Church and the Presbyterians were incompatible. As soon as the plague was removed, the Dissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which were deserted by the incumbents retired; they could expect no other but that they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with their penal laws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and persecute them as soon as they were recovered again; this even we that were of the Church thought was very hard, and could by no means approve of it.

        But it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it; we could only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it.

        On the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the Church with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning the people in their danger, and when they had most need of comfort, and the like: this we could by no means approve, for all men have not the same faith and the same courage, and the Scripture commands us to judge the most favourably and according to charity.

        A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that every man is not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock against. It is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in circumstances to do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives; but 'tis true also that a great many of them stayed, and many of them fell in the calamity and in the discharge of their duty.

        It is true some of the Dissenting turned-out ministers stayed, and their courage is to be commended and highly valued—but these were not abundance; it cannot be said that they all stayed, and that none retired into the country, any more than it can be said of the Church clergy that they all went away. Neither did all those that went away go without substituting curates and others in their places, to do the offices needful and to visit the sick, as far as it was practicable; so that, upon the whole, an allowance of charity might have been made on both sides, and we should have considered that such a time as this of 1665 is not to be paralleled in history, and that it is not the stoutest courage that will always support men in such cases. I had not said this, but had rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of those of both sides, who did hazard themselves for the service of the poor people in their distress, without remembering that any failed in their duty on either side. But the want of temper among us has made the contrary to this necessary: some that stayed not only boasting too much of themselves, but reviling those that fled, branding them with cowardice, deserting their flocks, and acting the part of the hireling, and the like. I recommend it to the charity of all good people to look back and reflect duly upon the terrors of the time, and whoever does so well see that it is not an ordinary strength that could support it. It was not like appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of horse in the field, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to stay was indeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less, especially as things appeared at the latter end of August and the beginning of September, and as there was reason to expect them at that time; for no man expected, and I dare say believed, that the distemper would take so sudden a turn as it did, and fall immediately two thousand in a week, when there was such a prodigious number of people sick at that time as it was known there was; and then it was that many shifted away that had stayed most of the time before.

        Besides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it to boast of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those that had not the same gift and support, or ought not they rather to have been humble and thankful if they were rendered more useful than their brethren?

        I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as well clergy as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates, and officers of every kind, as also all useful people who ventured their lives in discharge of their duty, as most certainly all such as stayed did to the last degree; and several of all these kinds did not only venture but lose their lives on that sad occasion.

        I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all those professions and employments who thus died, as I call it, in the way of their duty; but it was impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the particulars. I only remember that there died sixteen clergymen, two aldermen, five physicians, thirteen surgeons, within the city and liberties before the beginning of September. But this being, as I said before, the great crisis and extremity of the infection, it can be no complete list. As to inferior people, I think there died six-and-forty constables and head-boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney and Whitechappel; but I could not carry my list on, for when the violent rage of the distemper in September came upon us, it drove us out of all measures. Men did then no more die by tale and by number. They might put out a weekly bill, and call them seven or eight thousand, or what they pleased; 'tis certain they died by heaps, and were buried by heaps, that is to say, without account. And if I might believe some people, who were more abroad and more conversant with those things than I though I was public enough for one that had no more business to do than I had,—I say, if I may believe them, there was not many less buried those first three weeks in September than 20,000 per week. However, the others aver the truth of it; yet I rather choose to keep to the public account; seven and eight thousand per week is enough to make good all that I have said of the terror of those times;—and it is much to the satisfaction of me that write, as well as those that read, to be able to say that everything is set down with moderation, and rather within compass than beyond it.

        Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were recovered, our conduct had been more distinguished for charity and kindness in remembrance of the past calamity, and not so much a valuing ourselves upon our boldness in staying, as if all men were cowards that fly from the hand of God, or that those who stay do not sometimes owe their courage to their ignorance, and despising the hand of their Maker—which is a criminal kind of desperation, and not a true courage.

        I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such as constables, head-boroughs, Lord Mayor's and sheriffs'-men, as also parish officers, whose business it was to take charge of the poor, did their duties in general with as much courage as any, and perhaps with more, because their work was attended with more hazards, and lay more among the poor, who were more subject to be infected, and in the most pitiful plight when they were taken with the infection. But then it must be added, too, that a great number of them died; indeed it was scarce possible it should be otherwise.

        I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that we ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion—I mean we that went frequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much of this was talked of in the books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have said enough already. It may, however, be added, that the College of Physicians were daily publishing several preparations, which they had considered of in the process of their practice, and which, being to be had in print, I avoid repeating them for that reason.

        One thing I could not help observing: what befell one of the quacks, who published that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague, which whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to infection. This man, who, we may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad without some of this excellent preservative in his pocket, yet was taken by the distemper, and carried off in two or three days.

        I am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers; on the contrary, I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of my particular friend Dr Heath; but yet I must acknowledge I made use of little or nothing—except, as I have observed, to keep a preparation of strong scent to have ready, in case I met with anything of offensive smells or went too near any burying-place or dead body.
Neither did I do what I know some did: keep the spirits always high and hot with cordials and wine and such things; and which, as I observed, one learned physician used himself so much to as that he could not leave them off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all his life after.

        I remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain set of drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful in the case of an infection; out of which, or with which, physicians might make an infinite variety of medicines, as the ringers of bells make several hundred different rounds of music by the changing and order or sound but in six bells, and that all these preparations shall be really very good: 'Therefore,' said he, 'I do not wonder that so vast a throng of medicines is offered in the present calamity, and almost every physician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his judgement or experience guides him; but', says my friend, 'let all the prescriptions of all the physicians in London be examined, and it will be found that they are all compounded of the same things, with such variations only as the particular fancy of the doctor leads him to; so that', says he, 'every man, judging a little of his own constitution and manner of his living, and circumstances of his being infected, may direct his own medicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations. Only that', says he, 'some recommend one thing as most sovereign, and some another. Some', says he, 'think that pill. ruff., which is called itself the anti-pestilential pill is the best preparation that can be made; others think that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist the contagion; and I', says he, 'think as both these think, viz., that the last is good to take beforehand to prevent it, and the first, if touched, to expel it.' According to this opinion, I several times took Venice treacle, and a sound sweat upon it, and thought myself as well fortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by the power of physic.

        As for quackery and mountebanks, of which the town was so full, I listened to none of them, and have observed often since, with some wonder, that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of one of them about town. Some fancied they were all swept away in the infection to a man, and were for calling it a particular mark of God's vengeance upon them for leading the poor people into the pit of destruction, merely for the lucre of a little money they got by them; but I cannot go that length neither. That abundance of them died is certain—many of them came within the reach of my own knowledge—but that all of them were swept off I much question. I believe rather they fled into the country and tried their practices upon the people there, who were in apprehension of the infection before it came among them.

        This, however, is certain, not a man of them appeared for a great while in or about London. There were, indeed, several doctors who published bills recommending their several physical preparations for cleansing the body, as they call it, after the plague, and needful, as they said, for such people to take who had been visited and had been cured; whereas I must own I believe that it was the opinion of the most eminent physicians at that time that the plague was itself a sufficient purge, and that those who escaped the infection needed no physic to cleanse their bodies of any other things; the running sores, the tumours, &c., which were broke and kept open by the directions of the physicians, having sufficiently cleansed them; and that all other distempers, and causes of distempers, were effectually carried off that way; and as the physicians gave this as their opinions wherever they came, the quacks got little business.

        There were, indeed, several little hurries which happened after the decrease of the plague, and which, whether they were contrived to fright and disorder the people, as some imagined, I cannot say, but sometimes we were told the plague would return by such a time; and the famous Solomon Eagle, the naked Quaker I have mentioned, prophesied evil tidings every day; and several others telling us that London had not been sufficiently scourged, and that sorer and severer strokes were yet behind. Had they stopped there, or had they descended to particulars, and told us that the city should the next year be destroyed by fire, then, indeed, when we had seen it come to pass, we should not have been to blame to have paid more than a common respect to their prophetic spirits; at least we should have wondered at them, and have been more serious in our inquiries after the meaning of it, and whence they had the foreknowledge. But as they generally told us of a relapse into the plague, we have had no concern since that about them; yet by those frequent clamours, we were all kept with some kind of apprehensions constantly upon us; and if any died suddenly, or if the spotted fevers at any time increased, we were presently alarmed; much more if the number of the plague increased, for to the end of the year there were always between 200 and 300 of the plague. On any of these occasions, I say, we were alarmed anew.

        Those who remember the city of London before the fire must remember that there was then no such place as we now call Newgate Market, but that in the middle of the street which is now called Blowbladder Street, and which had its name from the butchers, who used to kill and dress their sheep there (and who, it seems, had a custom to blow up their meat with pipes to make it look thicker and fatter than it was, and were punished there for it by the Lord Mayor); I say, from the end of the street towards Newgate there stood two long rows of shambles for the selling meat.

        It was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead, as they were buying meat, gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all infected; which, though it might affright the people, and spoiled the market for two or three days, yet it appeared plainly afterwards that there was nothing of truth in the suggestion. But nobody can account for the possession of fear when it takes hold of the mind.

        However, it Pleased God, by the continuing of the winter weather, so to restore the health of the city that by February following we reckoned the distemper quite ceased, and then we were not so easily frighted again.

        There was still a question among the learned, and at first perplexed the people a little: and that was in what manner to purge the house and goods where the plague had been, and how to render them habitable again, which had been left empty during the time of the plague. Abundance of perfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians, some of one kind and some of another, in which the people who listened to them put themselves to a great, and indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary expense; and the poorer people, who only set open their windows night and day, burned brimstone, pitch, and gunpowder, and such things in their rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the eager people who, as I said above, came home in haste and at all hazards, found little or no inconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did little or nothing to them.

        However, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into some measures for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned perfumes, incense, benjamin, rozin, and sulphur in their rooms close shut up, and then let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder; others caused large fires to be made all day and all night for several days and nights; by the same token that two or three were pleased to set their houses on fire, and so effectually sweetened them by burning them down to the ground; as particularly one at Ratcliff, one in Holbourn, and one at Westminster; besides two or three that were set on fire, but the fire was happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the houses; and one citizen's servant, I think it was in Thames Street, carried so much gunpowder into his master's house, for clearing it of the infection, and managed it so foolishly, that he blew up part of the roof of the house. But the time was not fully come that the city was to be purged by fire, nor was it far off; for within nine months more I saw it all lying in ashes; when, as some of our quacking philosophers pretend, the seeds of the plague were entirely destroyed, and not before; a notion too ridiculous to speak of here: since, had the seeds of the plague remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by fire, how has it been that they have not since broken out, seeing all those buildings in the suburbs and liberties, all in the great parishes of Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripplegate, and St Giles, where the fire never came, and where the plague raged with the greatest violence, remain still in the same condition they were in before?

        But to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain that those people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health, did take particular directions for what they called seasoning of their houses, and abundance of costly things were consumed on that account which I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses, as they desired, but filled the air with very grateful and wholesome smells which others had the share of the benefit of as well as those who were at the expenses of them.

        And yet after all, though the poor came to town very precipitantly, as I have said, yet I must say the rich made no such haste. The men of business, indeed, came up, but many of them did not bring their families to town till the spring came on, and that they saw reason to depend upon it that the plague would not return.

        The Court, indeed, came up soon after Christmas, but the nobility and gentry, except such as depended upon and had employment under the administration, did not come so soon.

        I should have taken notice here that, notwithstanding the violence of the plague in London and in other places, yet it was very observable that it was never on board the fleet; and yet for some time there was a strange press in the river, and even in the streets, for seamen to man the fleet. But it was in the beginning of the year, when the plague was scarce begun, and not at all come down to that part of the city where they usually press for seamen; and though a war with the Dutch was not at all grateful to the people at that time, and the seamen went with a kind of reluctancy into the service, and many complained of being dragged into it by force, yet it proved in the event a happy violence to several of them, who had probably perished in the general calamity, and who, after the summer service was over, though they had cause to lament the desolation of their families—who, when they came back, were many of them in their graves—yet they had room to be thankful that they were carried out of the reach of it, though so much against their wills. We indeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year, and one very great engagement at sea in which the Dutch were worsted, but we lost a great many men and some ships. But, as I observed, the plague was not in the fleet, and when they came to lay up the ships in the river the violent part of it began to abate.

        I would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year with some particular examples historically; I mean of the thankfulness to God, our preserver, for our being delivered from this dreadful calamity. Certainly the circumstance of the deliverance, as well as the terrible enemy we were delivered from, called upon the whole nation for it. The circumstances of the deliverance were indeed very remarkable, as I have in part mentioned already, and particularly the dreadful condition which we were all in when we were to the surprise of the whole town made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection.

        Nothing but the immediate finger of God, nothing but omnipotent power, could have done it. The contagion despised all medicine; death raged in every corner; and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all, and everything that had a soul. Men everywhere began to despair; every heart failed them for fear; people were made desperate through the anguish of their souls, and the terrors of death sat in the very faces and countenances of the people.

        In that very moment when we might very well say, 'Vain was the help of man',—I say, in that very moment it pleased God, with a most agreeable surprise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even of itself; and the malignity declining, as I have said, though infinite numbers were sick, yet fewer died, and the very first weeks' bill decreased 1843; a vast number indeed!

        It is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very countenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly bill came out. It might have been perceived in their countenances that a secret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody's face. They shook one another by the hands in the streets, who would hardly go on the same side of the way with one another before. Where the streets were not too broad they would open their windows and call from one house to another, and ask how they did, and if they had heard the good news that the plague was abated. Some would return, when they said good news, and ask, 'What good news?' and when they answered that the plague was abated and the bills decreased almost two thousand, they would cry out, 'God be praised I' and would weep aloud for joy, telling them they had heard nothing of it; and such was the joy of the people that it was, as it were, life to them from the grave. I could almost set down as many extravagant things done in the excess of their joy as of their grief; but that would be to lessen the value of it.

        I must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before this happened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two before, besides those that died, was such, and the lamentations were so great everywhere, that a man must have seemed to have acted even against his reason if he had so much as expected to escape; and as there was hardly a house but mine in all my neighbourhood but was infected, so had it gone on it would not have been long that there would have been any more neighbours to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what dreadful havoc the last three weeks had made, for if I might believe the person whose calculations I always found very well grounded, there were not less than 30,000 people dead and near 100.000 fallen sick in the three weeks I speak of; for the number that sickened was surprising, indeed it was astonishing, and those whose courage upheld them all the time before, sank under it now.

        In the middle of their distress, when the condition of the city of London was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God—as it were by His immediate hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was taken out of the sting. It was wonderful; even the physicians themselves were surprised at it. Wherever they visited they found their patients better; either they had sweated kindly, or the tumours were broke, or the carbuncles went down and the inflammations round them changed colour, or the fever was gone, or the violent headache was assuaged, or some good symptom was in the case; so that in a few days everybody was recovering, whole families that were infected and down, that had ministers praying with them, and expected death every hour, were revived and healed, and none died at all out of them.

        Nor was this by any new medicine found out, or new method of cure discovered, or by any experience in the operation which the physicians or surgeons attained to; but it was evidently from the secret invisible hand of Him that had at first sent this disease as a judgement upon us; and let the atheistic part of mankind call my saying what they please, it is no enthusiasm; it was acknowledged at that time by all mankind. The disease was enervated and its malignity spent; and let it proceed from whencesoever it will, let the philosophers search for reasons in nature to account for it by, and labour as much as they will to lessen the debt they owe to their Maker, those physicians who had the least share of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge that it was all supernatural, that it was extraordinary, and that no account could be given of it.

        If I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to thankfulness, especially we that were under the terror of its increase, perhaps it may be thought by some, after the sense of the thing was over, an officious canting of religious things, preaching a sermon instead of writing a history, making myself a teacher instead of giving my observations of things; and this restrains me very much from going on here as I might otherwise do. But if ten lepers Were healed, and but one returned to give thanks, I desire to be as that one, and to be thankful for myself.

        Nor will I deny but there were abundance of people who, to all appearance, were very thankful at that time; for their mouths were stopped, even the mouths of those whose hearts were not extraordinary long affected with it. But the impression was so strong at that time that it could not be resisted; no, not by the worst of the people.

        It was a common thing to meet people in the street that were strangers, and that we knew nothing at all of, expressing their surprise. Going one day through Aldgate, and a pretty many people being passing and repassing, there comes a man out of the end of the Minories, and looking a little up the street and down, he throws his hands abroad, 'Lord, what an alteration is here I Why, last week I came along here, and hardly anybody was to be seen.' Another man—I heard him—adds to his words, ''Tis all wonderful; 'tis all a dream.' 'Blessed be God,' says a third man, and and let us give thanks to Him, for 'tis all His own doing, human help and human skill was at an end.' These were all strangers to one another. But such salutations as these were frequent in the street every day; and in spite of a loose behaviour, the very common people went along the streets giving God thanks for their deliverance.

        It was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all apprehensions, and that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man with a white cap upon his head, or with a doth wrapt round his neck, or with his leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his groin, all which were frightful to the last degree, but the week before. But now the street was full of them, and these poor recovering creatures, give them their due, appeared very sensible of their unexpected deliverance; and I should wrong them very much if I should not acknowledge that I believe many of them were really thankful. But I must own that, for the generality of the people, it might too justly be said of them as was said of the children of Israel after their being delivered from the host of Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea, and looked back and saw the Egyptians overwhelmed in the water: viz., that they sang His praise, but they soon forgot His works.

        I can go no farther here. I should be counted censorious, and perhaps unjust, if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting, whatever cause there was for it, upon the unthankfulness and return of all manner of wickedness among us, which I was so much an eye-witness of myself. I shall conclude the account of this calamitous year therefore with a coarse but sincere stanza of my own, which I placed at the end of my ordinary memorandums the same year they were written:—

A dreadful plague in London was,
In the year sixty-five,
Which swept an hundred thousand souls
Away, yet I alive.",Daniel Defoe,1963,"[95, 91]",2
539,Preacherman,"[Chorus]
Hey, Mr. Preacher Man
I've been playing with a heart like a violin
I've been stumbling through the door after 6 AM
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

I'm ashamed of the dark places I done been
Fix my soul so I don't lose a love again

Further into the night, so the further I go

We've been getting beat up by this old life

I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile
With some home brew
Malibu and Miller Lite

Girl put on that short little party dress
And make me a little bit Jealous
It’s going to be a wild weekend
Been on the phone with all my friends
There’s a little spot in the river bend were the sun sits high
Long as the keg don’t float and the ice don’t melt
We’ll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt

Girl you can bet we’ll fall in love again and again and again
It’s going to be a wild, wild, wild weekend

547,You Don't Love Me Anymore (And I Can Tell),"[Intro]
Okay, thanks

[Verse 1]
The moment that I write this song
It's like admitting you're gone
And that you don't belong to me anymore
In a single moment it seems
My plans have exploded at the seams
Now that I don't belong to you anymore
With each line I guess I'll start to heal
But I don't wanna write this song
Not ready to move on from a pain whose wholeness I am just starting to feel
From the moment that you told me
Up in your bed in your room that morning
A bed that was mine too for a time, for and from those moments I'm still mourning
And as I get further on, through this song, line by line
I cry a little bit less each time
Slowly accepting the fact that you're no longer mine

[Chorus]
And I don't believe you when you say
That you don't love me anymore
And I can't believe that you'd just ride away
Leaving me on your front lawn alone and crying
And I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
That I have to let you go
But I'm not ready
Not ready to let you go
If you want to I can't stop you
But baby
Please don't go

[Verse 2]
I'm not exactly doing fine
But I'm much better than I thought I'd be
Maybe I learned how to hide my emotions from you
You can be cold and hard-lined
You bottle up everything inside
So many bottles baby you better not fall over
But you were so sweet and kind
Your arms are still open wide
You're still holding my hand
You're still by my side
And I can't do this, I can't do it
I think you still love me
I don't believe you, I won't believe you but then you tell me that you wanna be with someone new
And while I'm on about this
Let me apologise for that last stolen kiss
You were so drunk but it was too good to miss
Baby, no wait
I can't call you that anymore
At least I can still call you that's better than not seeing you at all maybe
You're so stubborn I know I can't push you
But I don't want to lose you
Dude, let me tell you, friends aren't supposed to get as friendly as you do

[Chorus]
And I don't believe you when you say
That you don't love me anymore
And I can't believe that you'd just ride away
Leaving me on your front lawn alone and crying
And I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
That I have to let you go
But I'm not ready
Not ready to let you go
And if you want to I can't stop you
But baby
Please don't go

[Verse 3]
The moment that I write this song
It means it's all gone wrong
The moment has gone
The moment, the moment has passed
I thought it would last
I wish I'd learned how to write about happiness while I still had the chance
And as I get further on, through this song, line by line
I cry a little bit less each time
Slowly accepting the fact that you're no longer mine

[Chorus]
I don't want to believe you when you say
That you don't love me anymore
And I can't believe that you'd just ride away
Leaving me on your front lawn alone and crying
And I know I know I know I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know I know I know I noticed that

[Outro]
While you left me somehow
You're still holding my hand
You're still dancing with me
And it helps to think that we
Still have things to laugh and skip about
Thank you for giving me something so beautiful
It hurts this much to live without

Sax Fifth Avenue Flow
She rock the Gucci clutch
Don't give out the coochi much;
On the rare occasion she'll steam the dutch;
Wrist gleaming much
Such things will have you locked up with customs for custom rings;
She's accustomed to custom things
That you can't pronounce;
But I'm a Brooklyn dude and she loves hanging out;
We chill in Ft. Greene
She calls it Clinton Hill;
Plus she love it when I take her through Brownsville;
Always entertaining conversation
She pure heart;
Loving different cultures plus she's into art;
Never knew where to start
So I played my part;
Caught in the ""friend zone"";
Feeling like Eli in the red zone
No plays to score;
Even though her whole framework I did adore;
Her whole allure
Body crazy, skin mocha;
Down to earth
Watch sports and played poker;
Wonder if she knows how I felt
As we sat and conversate about a dude she dealt with;
I felt it every time she went into detail;
And not a tag on this female was retail

Chorus:
Shorty dress like a Hov song
All that shit Kanye talk
But she built like a hood girl
Beyonce got the same walk

My pants still sag

Gotta love her
When i need her
She come thru
I'm like, ""to run errands""
She like, ""whatever boo""
She's ramming bout pants sagging
As 2 dudes cross our path n'
As we flashin in the benz wagon
Her and two friends
We commence the blunt passin'
As they keep the conversation up
About how niggas need to grow up
I stay laughing
Cuz so often those are the ones that they end up with
Opposities attractin'
A strong statement
Guess that's how I ended with this situation
Cats hatin'
Seem like they waiting for my spot to be taken
But we just friends
I don't have the time or the patience
To deal wit her high maintenance
But moments alone
Have me second guessing
Always knew I could have her if I started pressin
And the way she fit into the things she dress in
That dvf, gievanchy, lanvin, & Louis Vuitton

Repeat Chorus

AZIZ Verse 3:
Shorty's from Chitown
Nice booty, eyes brown;
Takin' trips to Philly
Just to keep that vibe 'round;
Cause she says I'm different
Than most (of) the niggas that she
Meet on a daily basis
None of them make her happy;
Met her on the humble
Hoping out a taxi
Wit' two of her friends
Grabbing mad bags out the back seat;
Bout to hit Zaxby's
And lounge for a minute
Her whole style's on point
Like pyramids of kemit;
True queen, eyes green, name was maxine
Every time i hop in the benz
She bangin' c.r.e.a.m.;
Always had something to steam
So loud it'll scream
Louis bag matchin her jeans
Nahmean;
She was super fire
No one prior that i desire
On a mental note
Never focusing on vagina;
We prayed together went shopping
Even laid together;
Attracted to each other
But never played with pleasure
Yeah!

""The thing about relationships, that all men
Need to realize, cause I've had the problem, too
Of feeling guilty about this
The reality is men, we are always gonna wanna fuck other women
And a lotta times when you find a woman that is the woman of your dreams
And you love her and she's, she's all you EVER wanted in a woman
You're afraid to go forward with committing to her, and marrying her
Cause you really feel BAD about wanting to smash other women
It don't mean anything's wrong with your girl
She's still your great, find. But nigga, you ALWAYS gon' wanna smash somebody else.""",Phonte,1963,"[94, 77]",2
554,Diane,"[Chorus]
Oh, I promise I didn't know he was your man
I would have noticed a gold wedding band

Oh, Diane

You pick the time and the place
Don't know how much this hurts
I gave him my heart to break
Now I know he broke yours first
Lyin' right there in my bed

How could we be such fools?

She's so alive and she's dressed to kill, but

Now I ain't looking for no pretty face, oh no
Or for some hooker working roughish trade
And there isn't nothing like a perfect mate
And I am not looking for no wedding cake

I think I better sing just one more song
I've got one heart and it hurts like hell
I'm simply dying for some thrills, spills, oh yeah

562,"Back At The Chicken Shack, Part 1","a tractor trailer traveling quickly down the road. We pan back and see that it says “Rocky Mountain Office Supply. Colorado’s Office Supply Superstore.” We get various views of the truck then cut to the interior. A man is driving the truck and singing along to the song playing.

Driver: High and low I’ve traveled, far and wide I go. From the desert tracks to the mountainside I’ll bring you this traveling show.

He stops singing to pick up his cup and take a drink. He puts his cup down when a male voice comes over his CB.

CB Man: Big boy, this is little boy. How’d things go down at the chicken coop?

He picks up his receiver and talks into it.

Driver: Weight-station inspector needs to learn some adult words and a bit of hygiene, but he waved us through. The cargo is secure. Looks like a clean shot from here.

CB Man: Roger that. Little girl will take point on your front door. See you at the drop station, Mack. I’m clear.

We see the view from one of the side mirrors to see a black SUV. We pan back a bit to see two black SUVs driving alongside the truck. He looks down at the woman driving the first SUV and gives her a nod, she gives him a wave with a few of her fingers. She quickly pulls in front of the truck while the second SUV stays behind.

Suddenly the front SUV is lifted from the ground, almost like there was an explosion under it. However, we see no fire or any other indication of what caused the SUV to go airborne. It flies quite a distance into the sky then lands in front of the truck on it’s roof. The truck quickly swerves to avoid the SUV.

Driver: Son of a bitch!

He ends up taking the truck into the median between the opposite lanes of traffic but then gets it back on the road. He picks up his CB.

Driver: You see that?

CB Man: Little girl is down. Escort 2 is down!

Driver: I know, Sherlock. What the hell hit us?

He reaches up to the ceiling and hits a button. Suddenly his windshield has become a sort of touch screen computer. He hits a few buttons still keeping the truck on the road. We see a bright red line appear on the window in front of him. He waves it away then clicks the button on the ceiling turning off the computer. He picks up his CB.

Driver: We need to go to alt two, alt two.

CB Man: Nothing over our shoulder.

The SUV that was in the back is now moving to go in front of the truck.

CB Man: Back door’s clear. Protect the cargo at all costs.

The driver starts talking but no longer into the CB, just into the cab in general.

Driver: S.H.I.E.L.D. region CT, this is Agent Mack. We are under attack from an unseen I-don’t-know-what.

He’s looking up and all around trying to find out what’s going on. As he does so the SUV that is now in the front goes airborne just as the first one did. Except this time it’s shoved off the road, it doesn’t land in front of him. He gets a female response to his earlier statement.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Voice: Agent Mack advise as to the nature of threat, over.

Mack: What in the Holy name of –

He is looking up in the sky but his words are cut off when the truck goes airborne as well. The truck goes into the air at a 90 degree angle from the ground.

Mack: S.H.I.E.L.D. Region CT…oh, hell, I can’t explain.

The truck is suddenly dropped, almost like it had been held up by a string that has now been cut. We can hear Mack yelling as it falls.

Mack: Oh, no!

Black Screen.

Next we see the truck on its side, flames in the engine area. We can hear the S.H.I.E.L.D. voice still over intercom.

S.H.I.E.L.D. Voice: Mack, come in! Are you there, Agent Mack?

We pan to the cab of the truck, Mack is either knocked out or dead. While the cab of the truck has landed on its side the bed of the truck remains upright. We pan around the truck to see a construction backhoe slowly making its way over to the truck. Men in camo run behind the backhoe. They use the arm of the backhoe to break apart the bed of the truck. The men in camo are there once opened and are throwing out the empty paper boxes that were obviously a cover for whatever is in there. Once a path is clear we can see a door with a keypad and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo. One of the men in camo takes a blowtorch to the door working. Once they have made an opening they kick away the metal. Inside the room is a man strapped into some sort of chair. He puts his glasses on as they open his room.

Room Man: Are we there yet?

Title Screen.

Next we see The Bus flying through the air, looking all spiffy and fixed. We cut inside the cargo hold. Ward is in there hitting a punching bag. He is about to punch it when he sees someone and halts his hit.

Ward: You know, you’re late.

The camera pans over to show Skye walking down the spiral staircase. She’s dressed in a tank top and has her hands taped like Ward’s.

Skye: I’m tired from the mornings workout. I thought I was joining S.H.I.E.L.D., not 24 hour fitness.

She steps up to the punch bag and Ward stands next to her.

Ward: It’s called relative strength training, starting with the basics.

He takes her hand and messes with the tape.

Ward: And next time you do 15 push-ups for every minute you’re late.

He drops that wrist and picks up the other one.

Skye: Fine, Mr. Fun Machine. Better than pull-ups. I don’t ever want to do another pull-up again.

Ward: You find yourself hanging off the edge of a building 20 stories up, you’re gonna want to do at least one.

He stops messing with her tape and takes a fighting position facing the bag.

Ward: Stand here.

He pulls his hands up high, near his face.

Ward: Jab, cross, like this.

He shows her how he wants her to hit then backs up.

Ward: 10 minutes.

Skye hits the bag, but with nowhere near the force Ward was using.

Ward: You know the hardest part about boxing?

Skye: Getting punched in the face?

Ward: Keeping your hands up.

He once again pulls both of his hand up by his face showing her, she drops her arms in frustration.

Skye: Why do I even have to do this? I’m sure Fitz-Simmons’ supervising officer didn’t make them do this muscle stuff.

She weakly hits the bag a few times while speaking, Ward just stares at her.

Ward: You said you wanted to be a field agent, like Coulson. Well, if you’d like to switch disciplines…

He looks over into the lab. Both Fitz and Simmons are wearing lab coats. Fitz has an aerosol can in his hands spraying it showing a laser line as Simmons looks at Ward.

Ward: What did your S.O. give you guys for morning drills?

Simmons gets excited.

Simmons: Oh, atomistic attribute drills.

While she continues to speak Ward nods his head and looks at Skye, she in response weakly hits the bag again.

Simmons: Yeah, we’d name the mechanical, chemical, thermal –

Fitz: Electrical properties of materials.

Skye: Okay, okay, they made your point.

She continues to hit the bag, Ward walks to stand on the opposite side of the bag and hold it.

Ward: There will come a moment when you have to commit to this or bail. Every field agent has a defining moment. Ask Coulson. When you have to make the hard call to either dedicate yourself to this or to curl up in a ball and run.

Skye stops hitting, if that’s what you call it, and looks at Ward.

Skye: How can you run if you’re curled up in a ball?

She starts hitting again.

Ward: It’s my job as your S.O.to make sure you don’t die before then.

While he talks he lifts her hands higher up by her face.

Ward: Come on.

She starts to hit the bag again. (And funnily, in the background, Fitz seems to be pointing the laser at Simmons, we can see it on her face and she’s holding up her hands trying to block it. )

Skye: So what’s yours, Agent Ward?

Ward: 10 minutes.

Skye: Your defining moment?

He stays silent so she stops hitting.

Skye: Come on, tell me. I want to know.

She starts to hit again.

Skye: I can get Coulson to give you some of that truth serum. You could spill your little heart out to me again.

She’s teasing, but he seems to be taking it all seriously.

Ward: You mean my level one overshare that miraculously got you to cooperate?

She looks away unsure then back to him.

Ward: I hate to tell you this, rookie, but we don’t have a truth serum.

Skye’s mouth drops open in shock.

Skye: Wha-

There is a ding overhead and May’s voice comes over the speakers.

May: Changing course, briefing in three.

The camera pans over to Fitz in the lab.

Fitz: Ah, looks like we’re on the move.

He takes off his lab coat as Simmons smiles and does the same. Ward goes up the stairs as Skye sulks.

May over Intercom: S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 with new orders.

Cut to May inside the cockpit.

May: Set for Colorado air field north.

Cut to the living room area of the plane. Fitz and Simmons are sitting on a couch as Ward and Skye enter. Coulson enters from the opposite side of the plane.

Coulson: A few minutes ago a S.H.I.E.L.D. transport was attacked while carrying a priority red protected asset off Route 76 near Sterling.

Fitz whistles.

Simmons: Priority red?

Coulson: The asset was Canadian physicist Dr. Franklin Hall.

He walked in carrying a table, he now turns it so all can see a picture of Dr. Hall.

Coulson: Known for his work –

We pan over to see Fitz and Simmons both stricken by this news. Fitz’ face shows shock while Simmons has both of her hands to her face worried.

Simmons: Oh, no. Not Frank.

Fitz: Dr. Hall? He was our chemical kinetics advisor our second year.

Simmons: Yeah, he’s so enthusiastic about science, we just adored him. We can rescue him, can’t we?

Coulson: He’s one of ours. We’re gonna try.

Ward: And the attackers?

Coulson: Invisible.

He walks off as Skye gives Ward a confused look.

Skye: Wait, invisible?

She laughs amused.

Skye: Cool.

She looks at Ward, he shares none of her humor or excitement, she drops the smile from her face.

Skye: But terrible.

Cut to the whole group, Skye, Ward, Coulson, May, Fitz and Simmons walking on a dark street. The runner at the bottom of the screen says: Sterling, Colorado.

Skye: Dr. Hall was an asset?

Coulson: One of a few select scientists S.H.I.E.L.D. has been protecting, people our enemies would love to get their hands on. We keep them hidden, keep them on the move.

Simmons: Which is why Fitz and I were so lucky to have him.

Coulson: We don’t have him anymore.

Skye: And, what does priority red mean?

Coulson: It means security should have been…

His words trail off when they hear the groaning of metal. They look up and see one of the SUVS inside a tree.

Coulson: Heavy.

Cut to Mack. He is still alive but got banged up in the crash, there’s a large bandage on the side of his head.

Mack: It was pretty damn scary, and I don’t spook easily, boss.

We pan out to see he is sitting in the back of a van speaking with Coulson and May. Fitz is in the background on his tablet.

May: Nothing in the air from above?

Mack nods.

Mack: Nothing over our shoulder, but what’s scary is they knew our route.

We pan over to see that Fitz is shining some sort of grid like laser line onto the road. With this panned back view we can see that they are all next to the tractor trailer.

Mack: They were waiting for us.

Coulson: Are you saying they were working with somebody inside S.H.I.E.L.D.?

He looks down and away for a moment, almost embarrassed then looks back at Coulson.

Mack: Sorry to say…it had to be.

The sound of Simmons calling out gets their attention.

Simmons: Fitz, what am I seeing here?

We pan over to see Simmons has on some sort of green goggles and is holding some sort of metal instrument in her hand. Fitz walks over to her.

Fitz: Well, I’m not wearing the full-spectrum goggles I designed, so – no clue.

Skye and Ward also walk behind Fitz over to where Simmons is. May leaves Coulson’s side and wonders over, after a moment Coulson does as well.

He laughs to Skye, she doesn’t laugh so his falters off. They reach Simmons.

Fitz: Let me have a look, come on.

He goes to reach out to her but she stops him.

Simmons: No, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, don’t move!

She looks down at his feet when he stops.

Simmons: Wait a second.

She picks some rocks off the road and throws them into the air, they gather together swirling all around each other like a tornado.

Skye: What in the hell?

Simmons: I think the electro-static field scanner activated some…thing.

She smiles. They all duck when the batch of rock and dirt go flying every which way, taking out one of the lights as it does so.

Coulson: Okay, can we deactivate it? Now?

Simmons hits a few keys, it becomes more aggressive.

Fitz: Have to increase the density.

Simmons: I tried, Fitz, but –

Pieces of rock are hitting metal all around causing panging sounds as the others randomly duck.

May: Fitz!

He’s clicking away on something that looks like a mix between a cell phone and a walkie-talkie. One of the rocks hits it doing damage.

Fitz: Whoa.

Suddenly it all dies out. Simmons bends down to the ground and picks some sort of small sphere up off the ground using tweezers. She holds it out for Coulson to see.

Simmons: That did all this.

Coulson plucks the sphere off the tweezers and into his fingers.

Everyone is staring at the sphere Coulson has.

Skye: What is that?

We get a close up look at it, it almost looks like two rings that form a sphere, inside those rings, at the center is some sort of gray material that is constantly moving.

Coulson: Something big.

Commercial Break.

Open on Fitz inside the lab on The Bus. He has the device found on the road in some sort of machine, he’s looking at it with glasses that are lit on either side. The machine holding it is some sort of mechanized gripper. He lowers the device down as Coulson and May watch.

Coulson: Either someone cracked our comm system or Dr. Hall’s movements leaked from inside S.H.I.E.L.D.

We pan back further to see Simmons standing next to Fitz looking at the device and Skye standing next to her looking nervous.

May: You really think we have a mole?

Skye’s ears seem to perk up to this, she turns her head to listen but doesn’t look at them.

Coulson: I think you should go through the communication logs, rule it out. We’ll work the tractor tread that we found on the scene.

Skye leans back from the table.

Skye: I can do that, instead of pull-ups. I can upload an image of the tread pattern and check to see if there’s any sort of –

Her words are cut off by Ward.

Ward: Already done. Matched it to a 2010 model. Found a list of purchasers within a 500 mile radius. Narrowed down to those with priors, financial troubles or propensity for risk-taking.

Ward has pulled what he found on a screen in the lab. He hits a button on his tablet and points.

Ward: Three suspects.

We see three different mug shot looking pictures up on the screen now.

Coulson: Who may have sold their construction equipment to the kidnappers. We’ll ask.

Ward exits the room and Skye turns to Coulson.

Skye: Hey, so, Ward said a funny thing. He said that you guys don’t have a truth serum.

Coulson smiles.

Coulson: Did he? Ward said that?

Skye: Yeah.

Coulson: Interesting.

Skye: Yeah.

Coulson says nothing else and walks away.

Skye: Hey, wait –

May: Hey.

She turns her attention to May. May drops a giant binder into Skye’s waiting arms.

Skye: Do you want me to bench press this?

May: Read it. Every communication out of HQ since they decided to transfer Dr. Hall.

May walks away leaving a shocked looking Skye.

Skye: Hang in there, doc. It’s gonna be awhile.

Cut to outside, the runner on the bottom of the screen says: Barnroof Point, Colorado. We see a man riding a horse down a trail. When he gets to the bottom of the small hill he crested Coulson is waiting there.

Coulson: Excuse me.

The man stops his horse.

Man: Who the hell are you?

We can see Coulson has brought Lola out of the cargo hold. We can also see that the man has a shotgun holster on his saddle.

Coulson: A concerned citizen, who happens to be a member of a giant bureaucratic organization that’s tracking your every move.

Man: I haven’t done anything wrong.

Coulson: Of course not, but you sold your excavator to some people who did.

Coulson takes off his glasses.

Coulson: And you’re hiding out here until things cool down because you know it.

The man seems to go on guard.

Coulson: I just want to know who paid you.

He takes out the shotgun and points it at Coulson.

Man: Paid me enough not to answer any questions like that.

Suddenly an arm comes into frame gripping his shotgun, the arms give the gun a mighty pull causing the man to fall off his horse. We see those arms belonged to Ward and the man lands on his back holding up his hands in surrender as Ward points the shotgun at him.

Ward: Feels like the Old West.

Man: They gave me money for my equipment, that’s all. I never saw a face. I never heard a name.

Coulson: And how did you receive this money? They write you a check?

The man points at his saddlebag. Ward lowers the gun, just a bit, and reaches over to the saddlebag. He sakes the bag and thin bars of gold fall out. Coulson bends down and picks one up.

Coulson: Paid you in gold?

Ward: Now it really feels like the Old West.

Cut to inside the lab. The gold bars are sitting on a table as Simmons runs some sort of lit wand over them scanning them.

Simmons: It looks like this because it’s a Dore Bar. It means it was made at the mine rather than in a refinery. It’s only about 92% pure. The cowboy got cheated a bit.

Coulson: Can you determine the mine based on the impurities?

Fitz: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

He walks away from the bars of gold to a computer.

Fitz: We’ve done that already.

He clicks on the computer keys.

Fitz: It’s from the Dacey Mine in Tanzania, which is owned by –

Coulson: Quinn Worldwide. I’m sure you studied the CEO in your chemical engineering classes, or saw him on the cover of Forbes – Ian Quinn.

Coulson walks out of the lab.

Cut to nighttime over some city. The runner on the bottom says: Republic of Malta. We cut to a fancy house. A man and woman, both in white, are walking along the pathway. He’s speaking on his cell phone.

Fancy Man: We can’t just pluck it from the ground like a potato. It needs to be extracted from the ore and enriched. I know. You know, tell him this investment paid for that ridiculous yacht of his and that he’ll thank me at the shareholders meeting.

He takes the phone away from his ear and hands it to the woman.

Cut to inside a room, we see Dr. Hall sitting there. He perks up when he hears the door open and the Fancy Man walks up to him.

Fancy Man: Why is he tied up?

Hall: Quinn.

Quinn: Does he look like a threat?

A man walks over to Hall and uses a knife to cut his bonds.

Quinn: I’m sorry about these guys.

Quinn grabs a stool and sits down. He gives Hall a big smile then laughs. He reaches forward and claps Hall on his legs.

Quinn: Welcome to Malta, Frank.

Quinn laughs again, Hall doesn’t seem amused.

Hall: You know, it’s one thing to steal my ideas, Ian, but stealing me?

Quinn: First of all, I never stole our ideas. We always agreed information should be free.

Hall: It’s amazing how much money you’ve made off free information.

Quinn: And secondly, think of this as a rescue mission, Frank. In fact, in a moment, I think you’ll be thanking me. My staff intercepted a communication about the movement of a certain asset, and when I deduced that asset was you, I couldn’t pass up on the opportunity. It’s a little out of my comfort zone, sure.

He holds up a finger to Hall and stands, Hall following suit.

Hall: Malta You’re not stupid.

Quinn has walked over to some cabinets and opens them, pulling out a bottle of liquor.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D. can’t come after you here.

Quinn: Not just S.H.I.E.L.D. I am now a naturalized citizen of this fair country. Stunning beaches, beautiful tax laws and a deep seeded hatred of outside forces telling them what to do.

Hall: Sounds like your dating profile.

He smiles at Quinn who laughs.

Quinn: Right. I moved my entire operation down here. Bought the old Prime Minister’s estate. It’s not really my style, but they had this huge underground facility, so I figured, hey.

He walks around the table back to Hall with the drinks.

Hall: Always been a stubborn bastard. Now you’ve finally found a place where the watchdogs can’t touch you.

He takes the glass from Quinn holding it up, Quinn brings his glass up as well chinking them together.

Quinn: Not without breaking international law.

They both take a drink

Quinn: But, more importantly, old friend, they can’t touch you.

Quinn pulls something out of his pocket and shows it to Hall, it looks like the same type of device that was found on the road by Simmons. He sets it on a table above a monitor and looks at Hall.

Quinn: Recognize the design?

Hall picks it up and looks at it.

Quinn: We were barely old enough to drink when you sketched the blueprint. That’s just a miniature prototype. A theoretical machine powered by a theoretical substance.

Hall looks up at him with surprise.

Quinn: Frank, you were right.

He nearly smiles.

Hall: You found it?

Cut to Fitz standing in front of a monitor which shows some sort of atom behind him.

Fitz: Gravitonium. It’s an extremely rare high-atomic numbered element.

Simmons speaks from off screen.

Simmons: It powers the device.

We pull the camera out and see that they are speaking to Skye in their lab.

Simmons: It’s so extremely rare that most people didn’t believe it existed , much less the theory that an isolated positive charge –

Fitz: Would turn the flow from isotropic –

Skye stops them.

Skye: Guys, High School drop out here. How does the device work again?

Fitz looks over to Simmons for help, she complies. She gets out of her seat and walks to the picture of the atom on the monitor. She seems to go into school teacher mode, speaking slower and pointing at the atom like a spokesmodel would.

Simmons: Well, gravitonium distorts gravity fields within itself, causing an undulating amorphous shape.

Fitz decides to give it a try too.

Fitz: Yeah, which causes these, um, wiggly bits here, but when an electric current is applied the gravitonium solidifies.

He too is using basic hand gestures and speaking slowly. When he says “solidifies” he brings his hands together like a ball.

Fitz: And those gravity fields erupt…

He begins shaking his hands showing the movement of the atom then blows them apart. We see Skye’s face, not sure she’s getting this simpler version, she still looks confused.

Fitz: Randomly changing the rules of gravity around it.

Fitz moves to another part of the room seeming to get animated.

Fitz: Well, so, now you can imagine what would happen to a big rig at 100 kilometers per hour.

Fitz has walks over to what I believe to be his work station, it seems to be the place the goes to most when in the lab.

Fitz: Or, uh, well, you could just remember, cause we saw it already. Didn’t we?

Simmons: Yeah, and guess which genius published every theory about gravitonium and possible applications, years ago.

Skye: Dr. Franklin Hall.

Simmons smiles.

Simmons: Yes.

Fitz: Correct. And Dr. Hall attended the University of Cambridge at the same time as Ian Quinn.

Skye starts shaking her head.

Skye: Coulson may be off on this. Quinn is a notoriously good guy. His charity endowment’s something like $8 billion.

Simmons: Yes, with money made from leeching the Earth of its resources. Looks like he’s dug up another.

Cut back to Quinn and Hall in the same room, Hall still holds the device.

Quinn: 20 years, 12 mines, 6 continents, but yes, I finally found it. And now?

He laughs.

Quinn: We get to play with it.

He continues laughing as Hall scoffs just a bit.

Hall: Do you remember in all our talks on Orchard Street, the part where it’s very, very dangerous?

Quinn: Everything powerful is dangerous. But, I’m not going to convince you with more talk, talk of 50% shares, talk of Nobel Prizes. No, not you. You…

He reaches over to the monitor and slides his finger up pulling something up on the screen.

Quinn: Will just have to see it.

We hear a noise off screen, it sounds like a door opening. Hall looks over as the doors are opened. The camera pans and we see a bigger version of the device in his hand, a much bigger version.

Quinn: I built a full sized generator, but I need you to tell me how to control the gravity fields.

He looks from the big version down to the small version in his hand.

Quinn: You can complete your life’s work. I plan to do this, with or without you, but I know you. I know you’d want it done right.

Hall gives a tiny nod of his head and looks back at the big version as Quinn nods behind him and claps him on the shoulder.

Quinn: Now is the moment when you thank me.

Cut to inside the plane, see Skye walking toward where we hear Coulson and Ward talking.

Coulson: The man’s a prisoner, and it’s up to us to get him out.

Ward: We’ve checked the specs. There’s no way into Quinn’s compound without a large S.H.I.E.L.D. strike force or a man inside.

We now see that Coulson and Ward are discussing things in the Planning Room. As Skye enters the room we see that May, Fitz and Simmons are also in there.

Ward: He’s got Neodymium laser fencing surrounding the property.

Coulson: They’ll never allow a strike force into Malta. Plus, this weekend, Quinn Worldwide’s got its annual shareholders gathering. We’d risk global outrage, but –

May: If we go in alone –

Coulson: S.H.I.E.L.D. can disavow us, claim ignorance.

May: Without a man inside it’s impossible, unless you’re immune to Neodymium laser emissions.

Fitz stands up seeming to have gotten an idea.

Fitz: If we had a monkey, we could get in.

Simmons squeezes her eyes shut in frustration.

Simmons: Ugh, Fitz!

Fitz: If we had a small monkey he could slip through the sensors and disable the fence’s power source with his adorable little hands.

For his part Coulson seems to be actually listening, Skye not so much. She has her cellphone up and is messing with it.

Skye: I could go in.

No one seems to hear her.

Ward: Drop me in the hills outside of Valletta. I’ll spend a few weeks establishing a cover, gathering intel –

Coulson: Hall doesn’t have a few weeks.

Coulson walks away from the table frustrated.

Simmons: And to restate, any agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. caught on Maltese soil can be shot to death with bullets –

Fitz: Yeah.

Simmons: Legally.

Skye was leaning against the wall but now stands up straighter.

Skye: Not me. I could go in.

They all are finally looking at her.

Ward: Skye, this is serious.

Coulson: Wait.

He walks closer to her.

Coulson: What are you saying?

Skye: Well, I’m not an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., so I could go in without breaking all these stupid rules.

She pulls her phone back up and starts typing.

Simmons: International laws.

Ward: This isn’t something the Rising Tide can hack, Skye.

Fitz: Did you hear the deadly lasers part? Without a brave monkey –

Skye: You said you could go in with a man inside.

May: And you want to be that man?

Skye: Fitz-Simmons loved the guy, and he needs help. They could be torturing him, or worse, making him do strength-training.

She shoots Ward a look at this then goes back to typing on her phone.

Ward: But you don’t have the background or clearance or experience with any of this.

Ward has walked away from the table to stand closer to Skye, right next to Coulson.

Skye: I know.

She holds up her phone and shows them all the screen.

Skye: But I’ve got an invitation.

They all stare at her while the music builds, she looks at her phone then adds:

Skye: Well, technically it’s an e-vite.

Commercial Break.

Open on The Bus flying through the night sky. We cut inside The Bus and see Coulson staring at a large rack of suits.

Coulson: I understand your concern, but we don’t have a lot of options.

He pulls one suit out as the camera pans back to see Ward standing next to Coulson’s closet.

Ward: Hey, I’m impressed. She just wrangled an invitation on her phone using insider back-channel voodoo in minutes. But sending her in with no training, you’re taking a huge risk.

While Ward is speak Coulson is examining his suit choice. FYI, it looks exactly like the one he’s wearing. He takes it deeper in the room leaving Ward by the closet, Ward follows after.

Ward: I know Director Fury felt he owed you after you sacrificed yourself.

Coulson: And my card collection.

Ward: He gave you some autonomy, but Skye on a covert op?

Coulson: Are you worried about her safety or her loyalty?

Ward: Both. The Rising Tide is the reason she got an invite. Who knows how many protocols she violated.

Now while they’ve been talking Coulson has set down his suit inside his office. He goes behind his desk and opens a binder reading something there.

Coulson: That’s her job. Ignore protocol, find connections and back doors that nobody else can see. Something else is bother you.

Ward sighs and walks a few paces away.

Ward: She’s holding back, sir. She says she wants to be an agent, but she won’t commit. She doesn’t listen, makes jokes.

Coulson: Were you hard on her?

Ward: Sure. I tried playing nice, too. I need a new strategy.

Coulson finishes what he was doing at his desk and looks at Ward. As he talks he walks around his desk to sit on the front of it and address Ward.

Coulson: Try no strategy. Stop thinking like an operative, start thinking like a person. Maybe Skye will let that person help her.

Ward: Help her what?

Coulson: Help her think like an operative.

He gives him a tiny smile and stands up.

Cut to Ward and Skye in the cargo hold. Ward has a gun pointed at Skye’s chest.

Ward: Now, again, slowly, what’s first?

Skye looks at his wrist then takes a hold of it, she then spins herself so that Ward’s gun arm is over her shoulder and her back is to his chest.

Ward: And then?

Skye: Then? Things are moving too quickly. I’m a proper southern girl.

Ward drops his head in disappointment at her joking again as she takes on a southern accent.

Skye: You’ll make me untidy.

Ward lets out a sigh and takes her other hand placing it on top of his holding the gun.

Ward: Twist the thumb, palm the barrel.

He pulls the gun out of her grip and walks away.

Skye: Ow.

Ward: You’re gonna die and leave us hanging out to dry, you know that? You’re going in with no self-defense skills –

Skye: I have a few tricks up my sleeve.

Ward: You need muscle memory, fundamentals, the tools to turn yourself –

Skye: Into a whole bag of tools?

Ward: How did you learn computer science without committing yourself to it?

Skye: C.S. comes naturally to me. I’m sorry I’m not a naturally whatever you are.

This seems to upset Ward, he walks closer to Skye.

Ward: You think this came naturally? I had a brother who beat the crap out of me, me and my little brother, for nothing. For eating a piece of his birthday cake. I had to learn to protect us, the way I am trying to protect you.

Skye for once doesn’t have anything flippant to say.

Ward: That was my moment. You asked.

Skye: Sorry. I didn’t mean to push.

There is a moment where they just stare at each other. However, Skye breaks the tension by holding up Ward’s gun.

Skye: But I did manage to take this.

Ward is not impressed, he takes the gun from her.

Ward: Getting the gun is one thing. Pulling the trigger, that is another.

He once again points the gun a Skye’s chest.

Ward: Now, again, slowly, what’s first?

Cut to inside the Planning Room, they are using it for just that. Coulson is talking about the mission plan with everyone there.

Coulson: Skye will walk in the front door. The only external access point to Quinn’s underground facility is from a beach cove.

He has walked over to the large screen. We see blueprints of Quinn’s compound up on the screen and he points things out.

Coulson: A two man extraction team could slip in there, but it’s not easy. Fitz-Simmons.

Fitz walks closer to the screen.

Fitz: The perimeter is surrounded by a 20 foot high neodymium laser grid. Touch it and you’re toast.

Coulson: Dead toast. The only way to disable the grid is to crack the system and trigger a reboot. This would give the team three seconds to cross. Of course Quinn’s too smart to allow any wireless access on his property.

Skye: That’s where I come in.

Simmons opens a case that was sitting on the table.

Simmons: Yes, working compact – holds up under x-ray.

Fitz gets it out as Ward and Coulson move closer for a look. Fitz opens the compact and shows the inside to Skye.

Fitz: Desert Rose, to match your complexion.

Skye smiles at this.

Fitz: But, oh, what’s this?

We see the mirror of the compact, it now has five red dots on it.

Fitz: A read out, okay?

The lights switch from five red on the left side to five green on the right side.

Fitz: Turns green if you’re in close enough proximity to a computer to gain wireless access.

Simmons: When it does you just drop this nearby and walk out. We’ll do the rest. Easy as pie.

Ward: Or it will be, if you stick to the plan.

Ward racks his gun causing the distinct click.

Skye: Got it. Plan, green, drop, walk…pie.

As Fitz hands her the compact Coulson walks over to May.

May: I don’t want to question your orders, sir.

Coulson: Good.

He steps around her to start out of the room, she sighs and speaks anyway. Coulson stops walking and May turns toward him.

May: But, I’ve already seen far more combat than I bargained for. This two man extraction team? It’s exactly the kind of action I was hoping to avoid.

Coulson turns to face her.

Coulson: That’s why you’re not on it.

May gives him a disbelieving look.

May: Specialist work is different from field work, believe me. When was the last time you –

Coulson: Hall’s one of ours and he’s in trouble. I need two men to get him out. Ward makes one.

He stares at her a long moment, she is the first to shift her eyes away.

Coulson: So that’s why I’m going in. You forget, I saw plenty of action with The Avengers.

He walks away but May says something under her breath.

May: And you died.

Coulson: All right team, suit up.

We cut to a coastal city in daytime. The runner on the bottom of the screen says: Republic of Malta.

We cut to the front of Quinn’s estate. People are entering when a taxi pulls up. Skye, looking fancy in a pink dress with her hair curled, gets out of the taxi. She takes a deep breath then walks forward to the front door.

Cut to inside the party, people are milling about, drinking and talking in low tones. A waitress stops by Skye with a tray of Champaign, she takes one.

Skye: Thank you.

The waitress walks away and Skye walks deeper into the party, sipping on her Champaign and taking it all in. Now a waiter walks up to Skye.

Waiter: Hors D’oeuvre, Madame?

She takes some sort of skewer off the tray and continues walking, but a man’s voice stops her.

Man: Who are you?

She quickly turns around to face the man. He is an older gentleman, a younger one walks over when he speaks to Skye.

Young Man: Oh, apologizes for his manners. He knows very little English.

Skye: Oh, that, uh, that’s – what, whatever.

She waves away the worry then extends her hand to the older man for a handshake.

Skye: Skye.

He slowly reaches out and shakes her hand.

Older Man: Qasim Zaghlul.

Skye: Big fan. You built half of Dubai, including the Arabian Blade.

He gives just the tiniest smirk.

Skye: I love that building, it’s super sci-fi. Where’s your wife…

We cut to inside The Bus. May and Simmons are standing at the Planning Table. May is feeding information to Skye as needed.

May: Wife’s name is Nadrah.

Cut back to Skye.

Skye: …Nadrah?

We hear May over Skye’s earpiece.

May: Twin sons.

Skye: Is she staying at home with the boys?

Cut back to inside The Bus. It looks like Fitz has just arrived, with a large bowl of popcorn. He whispers to the others.

Fitz: How’s she doing?

May and Simmons answer at the same time.

Both: She’s good.

Cut back to Skye, she reaches out and touches Qasim on the arm.

Skye: The pleasure is mine.

She gives them a small laugh then turns away. She almost immediately puts her hand to her ear after walking away from the men to talk to them on The Bus. (Something that would seem super obvious to me, but whatever.)

Skye: I could get used to this, people. It’s like Siri if it worked.

Skye looks at a group of people off to her right.

Skye: Sipper to Bravo, I got eyes on top dog. The eagle is landing on it.

Cut back to The Bus, May and Simmons look confused.

Simmons: What are you doing?

Cut back to Skye.

Skye: Uh, sorry, I – I don’t know. I see Quinn, I’m gonna go talk to him.

She starts off toward him.

Cut to The Bus, the three of them give each other worried looks.

Cut back to Skye. Quinn is walking toward her so she positions herself in his path.

Quinn: I mean, that and it’s effective on the industrial average.

She joins the group, when the others laugh so does she.

Man: That was good.

Skye: Yeah, right? Ian Quinn. I’m your last minute party crasher. Skye.

She extends her hand and he takes it giving it a shake.

Quinn: Oh.

He chuckles.

Quinn: Wow.

She chuckles as well.

Quinn: Great to meet you.

He address the others in the group around him.

Quinn: This is Skye, a member of The Rising Tide.

They all look at her, she gives a little wave.

Quinn: They’re a group of hackers. They’ve gotten some pretty big secrets out to the public.

Skye looks at the others.

Skye: I prefer “Hacktivist”. I’m glad you’ve heard of our site.

Quinn: I read it. We think very much alike, more freedom of information, less government infringing on everyone’s rights, I’m a fan.

Skye: That explains the invite. This is a tough party to get into.

Quinn: Not as hard to get into as the encrypted back channel you contact us through to request the invite.

She laughs.

Skye: That’s sort of where I live.

Quinn: You got to show me how you did that, I mean, if you sign on.

She looks to the others then back to him. This totally throws her off.

Skye: Sign what, now?

Quinn: I’ve been known to turn a few black hats into white hats. Not just for vulnerability analysis, but for very creative thinking.

Skye: A-Are you offering me a job?

Quinn: Well I didn’t invite you here for your pretty face. I didn’t know you had a pretty face. Yes, I want to hire you before someone else snatches you up.

He walks away from the group leaving Skye looking shocked. We hear May over her earpiece.

May: That seemed to go well.

Skye: Yeah, it did.

(Once again all she does is turn her back to the other people standing there, putting no distance between them. Probably won’t amount to much, but she’s bad at the stealth part of undercover.)

She takes a drink as the people at the party start to clap, Quinn has gotten in front of them to address them all. He is under a tent standing at a podium talking.

Quinn: Many of you shareholders have been with us for years, and I see a few new names here, but I want to thank you all for traveling so far to this beautiful country. And, well, for slumming it at Shaba Tal-Banar.

The crown laughs at his joke as he takes a drink.

Quinn: This country where we are allowed to pursue progress and profit without the stranglehold of regulations that are now choking our world. The United States government, the E.U., the DRTC, S.H.I.E.L.D., these are just a few of the institutions that are guilty of halting the development of new technology for anyone, except themselves.

Cut to the beach, we see Coulson and Ward coming ashore dragging an inflatable raft. While they do this we still hear Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: We dare defy them with a new idea.

We zoom closer to Coulson and Ward, Ward is in black pants with a black T-shirt, Coulson is – as usual – in a suit and tie.

Quinn: The steal in and sweep it out from under us.

Cut back to Quinn.

Quinn: But not today. You’re all aware of what Quinn Worldwide has been able to do with basic minerals, let alone Uranium or Plutonium, despite these unjust restrictions that weigh the scales in the other guy’s favor.

We pan over to Skye, she looks around seeing everyone is watching Quinn and begins to move away. We then pan back to Quinn.

Quinn: Well, today, I’m announcing something new, an element that could balance those scales.

The camera pans over from Quinn to the TV screen next to him showing the atom of gravitonium.

Quinn: And I mean that quite literally.

Cut to inside the room where we saw the full sized version of the device Quinn gave to Hall. Now there is a black undulating mass being lowered so it is parallel with the center of the device. We still hear Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: Imagine if you could control gravity.

The camera cuts to show Hall busy at work on some monitors.

Quinn: If instead of drilling for oil, it rose up to greet you.

Cut back to Quinn.

Quinn: Imagine if you could move a super tanker’s worth of cargo with a swipe of your hand.

Cut back to inside the room with the full sized device. The robotic arm that lowered the black mass into place is now behind it, pushing it into the center of the device. We still hear Quinn talking.

Quinn: Well, we will do this and more.

Hall is busy punching things into the computer. We hear Coulson speaking while we watch Hall.

Coulson: This could have been a traumatic experience for Dr. Hall.

Cut to Coulson and Ward on the beach.

Coulson: He may not be the same when we find him, Ward. I’ll talk him down. We don’t want your personality to set him on edge.

Ward: Great time for humor, sir. My people skills are the least of our problems if Skye can’t get us in.

Cut to Skye walking down a hallway looking for a signal. She stops outside a set of double doors and pushes on them, it doesn’t open.

Skye: It’s locked, but there’s no lock.

Cut to The Bus, Fitz, holding the popcorn bowl and eating some, answers.

Fitz: Eh, check for a keypad.

Cut to Skye, she leans to the left side of the door then the right looking.

Skye: Nothing. Wait, you can hack a keypad?

She looks impressed. We cut to Fitz who’s face falls.

Fitz: No, not over the phone.

May: Is there a reception desk?

Skye looks to her right and sees a small desk set up in the hallway, she walks toward it.

Skye: Okay, yeah.

She gets to the desk.

Skye: Well, now what do I do?

Skye looks to her left when she hears Quinn’s voice.

Quinn: What are you trying to do?

She sets down her glass then looks at the desk.

Skye: Just…

She chuckles.

Skye: Looking for a pen.

She pulls one out and holds it up to him.

Skye: Here we go.

She laughs again, Quinn smiles but he’s not buying what she’s selling.

Skye: Got to write down all those good ideas, you know what I mean? Of course you know what I mean. You probably have like 10 pens for all your ideas.

Quinn: What are you really doing?

She looks nervous for a moment then seems to think of something.

Skye: All right. I’m busted. I was trying to get a glimpse behind your office doors, see how things really operate.

He takes a few steps closer to her.

Quinn: I invite you here as a guest, you treat me like another corrupt institution, looking for trade secrets to leak online.

He backs up from her and puts his phone near his mouth.

Quinn: Security.

Skye: No, no, no, wait.

He takes the phone down.

Skye: It’s just with all these la-di-da people, you have to be so guarded, so careful. What’d you say, what secrets you reveal.

She is leaning down to the desk, she appears to be writing something.

Skye: And…I was hoping that you and I could be honest with one another. If you know what I mean.

She holds up the piece of paper she was writing on, it says: SHIELD is listening. His face turns serious and she nods her head.

Commercial Break.

Open inside The Bus. Fitz, Simmons and May are still listening in. We can hear Skye’s voice over the intercom.

Skye: My office had less space, more wheels. Wow. A view of the ocean and the pool.

Quinn: Not a bad place to do business.

May: Got the dispatch leaking Hall’s location. User’s an alias.

Fitz: Oh, can you trace the DHCP server –

May: Trace is running, but it’ll take time. Our girl?

Simmons: I thought she was done for, but she’s just sweet talked her way into Quinn’s office.

May: How’d she manage that?

Fitz: Pbht! She probably just used her, um…

He has raised both of his hands up by his chest indicating her breasts.

Both Simmons and May shoot him a look and he starts to stammer.

Fitz: Uh…uh…her, uh…ah, boobs.

Simmons sighs.

Simmons: Ugh. That’s the only explanation –

She is cut off when the audio fee from Skye goes silent.

Simmons: Oh, my gosh, the signal’s dead.

She hits a button the gets worried.

Simmons: Fitz!

Fitz: What, I didn’t , she must’ve, oh lord.

Cut to Quinn’s compound. The earpiece Skye was wearing is dropped into a Champagne glass. Skye lets out a sigh.

Skye: Much better. Haven’t felt that “someone’s watching my every move” feeling since I failed my driver’s test.

Quinn: You want to tell me what the hell is going on?

He picks up the glass looking at the earpiece.

Quinn: S.H.I.E.L.D. got to you?

Skye: They picked me up in L.A., I helped them in a crisis, and now they want to recruit me.

Quinn: Of course they do.

He sets the glass down on his desk.

Skye: So, I played along, talk about inside info, I have a bunk on their plane. I’ve been gathering intel, biding my time until I could become useful. I thought this qualified.

Quinn: Why would they trust you with a covert operation like this?

Skye: Something about S.H.I.E.L.D. not breaking international laws. They had no other options, whereas I like to keep mine open.

Cut to Coulson and Ward on the beach. The come across a sign that says: DO NOT CROSS LETHAL RADIATION. Coulson bites his lip then bends down and picks up some rocks. He throws them up in the air and they hit the laser grid, flashing yellow. Ward takes a deep breath and gives Coulson a look of worry.

Ward: Next patrol any minute now.

May’s voice comes to them over their earpieces.

May: Skye’s offline. Repeat, we’ve lost audio and vitals.

Ward: Abort is not an option, but if she’s compromising –

Coulson: She’s still our only way in to get to Dr. Hall.

Ward: And we’re their only way out.

We hear a man’s voice behind them.

Man: Beach is all clear. Let’s move up the ridge.

Coulson and Ward move quickly trying to find cover as guards come walking up toward them.

Cut back to Skye and Quinn, she is now sitting on the sofa in his office.

Skye: You’re saying they wanted to rope me in because I pose a genuine threat?

Quinn is standing next to one of the windows.

Quinn: Yes, and fit their profile.

Skye: Profile?

Quinn: Sure. You’re a criminal. You have a warrant somewhere.

She scoffs.

Skye: Probably.

Quinn: Specialized skill set.

Skye: I try to stay humble, but fail.

Quinn: No family.

Skye has no quip for this, she lowers her eyes for a moment.

Quinn: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hit a nerve, but that is what these people do. S.H.I.E.L.D.

He leans in close to her.

Quinn: They prey on fear and loneliness and desperation, and then they offer a home to those who have no one else to turn to. I can offer you something better.

She looks away.

Cut back to the beach. The guards have crested the top of the ridge where Coulson and Ward are hiding. Coulson rushes out of some bushes and knocks the lead security guard’s hand away from his gun. Ward fights another as Coulson takes down his. In short order they have the guards knocked out. Coulson took one of their guns and takes the clip out, he goes to clear the chamber but has a problem.

Coulson: Damn. A little rusty, I guess.

Ward takes the gun out of his hands and casually throws it into the laser grid, it goes up in a puff of smoke.

Coulson: Guy’s clocks ticking. Where’s Skye?

Cut back to Skye and Quinn.

Quinn: Stay with us, there’s no secrets, no lies and no agenda. You’re free to do what you do without big brother watching over you.

Quinn stands and walks to sit next to Skye on the sofa.

Quinn: But first, you have to tell me exactly what agenda S.H.I.E.L.D. sent you in here with.

Skye: Well, they wanted me to do whatever it takes to get in here.

She opens her purse and pulls out the compact. She looks at herself in the mirror and sees that there are red dots on the left side of the mirror.

Quinn: Get in here and…?

The lights suddenly go green. She runs a finger under one of her eyes.

Skye: Bat my eyes.

She snaps it closed then sets it on the table.

Skye: Get you talking.

Cut to The Bus. A despondent looking Simmons is leaning down over the table as May studies a monitor behind her. May quickly turns when she hears a beeping sound.

May: We’re in!

Simmons stands straighter.

Simmons: She’s done it!

May: Fitz, you’re up.

He quickly hurries over to the table.

Fitz: Oh, mother of all things.

He tries to cut in front of May to get at the table.

Fitz: Move, move, move!

He is quickly typing away.

Cut to Coulson and Ward, they have tied the hands of the security guards. A voice comes over the security guards radio.

Man: We have a man down! Hostiles on the east ridge!

Coulson and Ward both duck when gunfire hits around them. They run to the laser grid but find it still one when a bullet hits it.

Coulson: We need a reset here, Fitz!

Cut to The Bus, Fitz is still furiously typing.

Cut back to Coulson and Ward. They continue to duck from incoming fire as Ward pulls out his gun.

Coulson: Fitz!

Cut back to The Bus, Fitz is still working.

Simmons: Saying his name repeatedly does not increase productivity!

Fitz: Okay, go.

Simmons: Oh, maybe it does.

The monitor behind Fitz and Simmons shows a countdown of three seconds.

Cut to Coulson and Ward, the grid goes down and they rush through. We can hear Fitz voice over their earpieces.

Fitz: System rebooting in two, one, now!

For some reason Ward has waited until the last possible moment to dive through the opening. A shot is fired at them but it hits the grid instead of them. With the cover of the grid they hurry away. We next see them walking up some stairs toward the house.

Coulson: I’ll look for Dr. Hall down in the lab.

Ward: I’ll get Skye.

They split up.

We cut to Skye and Quinn.

Quinn: No, you can’t be the only angle. S.H.I.E.L.D.’s thorough enough to know about me and my exploits. It takes more than a pretty face to disarm me.

A large man enters the room.

Large Man: Sir, we have a security breach.

Quinn gets off the sofa quickly.

Skye: Oh, the timing on that was perfect.

Quinn lets out a sigh and picks up her compact. He takes one look at it then breaks it in two and throws down the pieces. He turns to the large man, pats the large mans’ chest, and then pulls out his gun and points it at Skye.

Cut to inside the lab where Dr. Hall is still working over his monitor. The door opens and Coulson enters.

Coulson: Dr. Hall.

Coulson enters the room, shoots a glance at the device, then turns his attention back on Hall.

Coulson: Agent Coulson, we have an exit strategy.

Hall isn’t look at him, he’s paying attention to the device.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D.?

Coulson: Yes, sir. Let’s get you out of here.

Coulson heads to the door but Hall’s voice stops him.

Hall: I’m sorry, Mr. Coulson, I’m right where I’m supposed to be.

He spares Coulson a brief glance then goes back to working on the device.

Coulson: I’ll be honest, our strategy did not take into consideration you saying that.

Cut to May on The Bus, she’s still trying to locate where the leak of Hall’s whereabouts came from. There are two messages on her screen: Alias Identified and Camera Memory Loading… Once it does load we see Dr. Hall looking at the camera, on the bottom of the screen it says: Alias DHCP Login Identified; Work Station 32.29.1 Camera Memory Accessed. May lets out a sigh.

May: Oh, no.

Cut back to Coulson in the lab with Hall. He’s standing in front of the device with his back to it not paying it much attention.

Coulson: Look, I don’t know what Quinn is promising you but –

Hall: An opportunity.

There are zapping noises coming from the device. This gets Coulson’s attention finally and he looks back at the device. The black undulating mass is now sparking blue with electricity and the rings around it are spinning. Coulson looks from the device to Hall.

Coulson: We can’t let Quinn have control of this. It’s too dangerous.

Hall: We can’t let anyone have control of this. That’s why I’m here, to bury it at the bottom of the ocean, with him.

The sounds of zapping have increased and how the rings are beginning to light up with power. Coulson steps closer to the glass separating them and looks at the device. May’s voice comes over Coulson’s earpiece.

May: Coulson.

Cut to May on The Bus.

May: The leak came from –

Cut back to Coulson still looking at the device.

Coulson: Dr. Hall. Yeah, I’m getting that.

Hall: All petitions, embargos in the world could stop Ian. He grows more powerful every day. And then I get word that he’s found this.

We see the device and the rings are spinning even faster. As we watch the whole thing seems to come alive with electricity. The force of it coming alive seems to rock the whole compound, Coulson is knocked back for a second.

Hall: I’m sorry, Mr. Coulson. I had to make a choice.

Hall hits another button and holds it, this seems to discharge the energy that’s been building. The cabinets in the room all open spilling out the contents and sending them toward the device.

Coulson: Something tells me that wasn’t the “off” button!

Suddenly Coulson is ripped off his feet and throw to the right out of frame.

Commercial Break.

We open back inside the lab. Coulson is knocked out on the floor with bottles and various things strewn around him. He wakes up with a gasp and puts his hand to his earpiece.

Coulson: Guys, we need to talk.

Cut to May, she’s walking down one of the sets of metal stairs, she puts her hand to her own earpiece.

May: Lost you for a minute. We’re aware of the problem, sir. Hall wanted Quinn to kidnap him?

May enters Fitz-Simmons’ lab, they are busy at work.

Fitz: Yeah, why would he do that?

Simmons: What is wrong with him?

Cut to Coulson still trying to get his bearings and get to his feet.

Coulson: Quinn built a gravity generator, like the one we found but bigger. Hall knew Quinn would need him to control its raw power, but Hall just wanted to unleash it.

Coulson has managed to get to his knees but grunts in pain.

Cut back to the lab on The Bus.

Simmons: The one that we found was 2.5 centimeters in diameter. It stopped a semi.

Cut back to Coulson.

Simmons: How big are we talking?

Coulson: 12 feet. It’ll definitely take down the entire compound.

Cut to the lab on the bus.

Simmons: It’ll skink the place.

Fitz: No, it’ll do more than that.

Cut to Coulson.

Coulson: Work a solution. I’ll disconnect the power before things get…

He’s finally able to stand taller on his knees. When he does he sees that he is hanging upside down on the ceiling. The only thing left on the real ground is the monitor Hall was using, and that’s cause it’s actually bolted to the floor.

Coulson: Crazy.

The camera does a 180 spin so that the room is right for us from Coulson’s perspective. As the camera spins Hall enters the room holding a gun.

Hall: They can’t help you.

He walks over to the cabinet that held the bottle of booze and pulls it out showing it to Coulson with a smile.

Hall: Soon, It’ll reach and exponential acceleration state.

Hall has pulled a glass out of the cabinet. He bends down and picks up a chair righting it. Coulson gets off the floor and stands. Hall is looking at the device so Coulson looks at it too.

Hall: I’m sorry.

The device is spinning really face, all the lines are glowing on it.

Coulson: My team’s here, good people.

Hall: Sworn to protect all mankind? That’s what I’m doing, I promise. Making things right.

He holds up his glass at a weird angle and pours his drink, the liquid goes sideways. He chuckles then takes a drink. Suddenly the whole room shifts. Coulson is thrown against a wall as Hall stands and his chair his swept away from him. Hall’s starts walking with an exaggerated slant to his body.

Cut to a Skye and Quinn. Quinn pushes Skye against the wall with one hand holding her neck and the other holding the gun to her head.

Quinn: Don’t you get it? S.H.I.E.L.D.’s against everything you stand for. They’re Big Brother.

Skye: Maybe. But they’re the nice Big Brother who stands up for his helpless little brother when he’s getting beat up because he ate a piece of cake that he wasn’t…

Skye is rambling and Quinn looks lost.

Skye: You know…you kidnapped a person!

Quinn gets upset at this, he releases Skye and steps away from her.

Quinn: I set him free! I saved him!

Skye massages her neck once it’s free.

Quinn: And I could’ve saved you.

Cut to Ward, he enters a hallway and looks around

Ward: This place is massive.

He chooses to go left.

Cut to The Bus. There is map of the compound up on the monitor in the lab. May is there, along with Fitz-Simmons, leading Ward.

Ward: Where am I heading?

May: Southwest corner.

We cut back to Ward. He starts to move but then stops, the device is starting to affect the gravity above.

May: Ward, tell me you’ve got things covered on the ground.

Cut back to The Bus.

May: I can’t do a damn thing from out here.

Cut back to Ward, he’s looking around trying to figure out what’s happening.

Ward: I’m working on it.

He goes the opposite way down the hallway.

Cut to Skye and Quinn, the ground below them rocks causing them to lose their balance. Quinn becomes even more upset.

Quinn: Tell me what they’re doing!

Skye remains silent and looks scared, Quinn lowers his voice and puts softness in it.

Quinn: Tell me what they’re doing. You have to talk. You have no other way out of this.

He laughs and pulls his gun up to point at her head again.

Quinn: You’re expendable to S.H.I.E.L.D. They sent you in here with nothing.

Skye busts out the move Ward taught her on The Bus, disarming Quinn of his gun. She points it at Quinn and his bodyguard.

Skye: They taught me a few things.

Security Guard: Kids got balls.

Skye: Thanks but, yuck.

Quinn: But, do you have what it takes to pull the trigger?

Skye thinks about this, her eyes go wide.

Skye: Nope.

She drops the gun, runs out the door and leaps off the balcony into the pool below.

Cut back to inside the room with Quinn.

Quinn: Get her.

The second body guard rushes past Quinn and the first toward the doorway. They are all once again knocked around from the device. This time Quinn falls to the floor. There are two pins there and for a moment they balance on their points, then lower. Quinn rolls his eyes.

Quinn: Hall. We have to evacuate. Get the chopper. Now!

The guard hurry to do his bidding.

Cut back to inside the compounds lab. The device is running even faster now. Coulson is sliding along one of the walls, going upwards toward the ceiling. Hall gets to his feet and points the gun on Coulson.

Hall: All I had to do to get access to Quinn’s lab was drop little clues, create puzzles for him to solve. Quinn likes to feel smart.

Coulson: So you leaked your location. Why not try reasoning with him?

Hall: You can’t reason with an addict, and he’s addicted to exploiting opportunities. He never gives a thought to the friends, ecosystems, future generations left ruin in his wake.

Coulson: Like Agents Fitz and Simmons, your former students?

Hall drops the gun down taking this in.

Coulson: I’ve got them in my ear right now telling me you’re not a bad guy. We could’ve worked with you on this.

The devices powers up more and sends out another blast knocking them around. Hall maintains his footing but Coulson falls to the floor.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D.?

Hall gets upset.

Hall: S.H.I.E.L.D. is just as guilty of the same thing, experimentation without thought of consequences! Your search for an unlimited power source, brought an alien invasion.

Coulson nods his head.

Coulson: Fair point.

The room rocks again and Hall falls to his knees, he is still pointing the gun at Coulson however. Coulson tries to regain his footing.

Hall: This element is far too powerful for you, for him, for anyone! I don’t have to tell you that.

Another tremor rocks the room.

Hall: You’re feeling it now.

Once again the room shifts causing them both to lose their footing.

Cut to outside, a helicopter takes flight. It seems like the party is still going on but all the party goers and help staff are frightened and trying to figure out what’s going on. Skye runs past them. She stops for a moment, figures out where she is and continues running. She sees a couple of security guards appear from a flight of steps and turns to run the other way. One guard comes up from that way blocking her escape. The two behind her catcher her and hold her by her arms.

Skye: No, no, no, no! Please, please!

Ward suddenly appears behind the one guard, when the guard turns Ward elbows him in the face then fights him. The other two guard release Skye and fight Ward. Ward quickly takes the three guard out. Once she’s sure the guards are down Skye rushes to Ward, she is nearly clinging to him and panting with fright.

Ward: Are you hurt?

She shakes her head.

Ward: Just follow my orders. I’ll get us out of here.

He takes her hand and leads her away.

Cut to inside the lab where all hell is breaking lose. Papers, bottles, people and a gun are flying all around the room. Hall gets to the gun before Coulson can but Coulson is able to hit Hall when they both stand up. He knocks Hall down and takes control of the gun.

Hall: I see the future, Mr. Coulson, and it’s a catastrophe.

Now that the room is calm we can see that the “floor” now is actually the wall with the window that leads into the device.

Coulson: I just see a lot of people in trouble.

He pulls a wire down from the wall causing sparks.

Coulson: Nothing, Fitz-Simmons?

Cut to the lab on The Bus.

Coulson: I tried to cut the power. It’s still going.

They both sit up straighter.

Fitz: You need to find a catalyst.

Simmons: Find a catalyst. Something to create a chemical reaction in the core.

Cut back to the lab in the compound.

Coulson: It’s not too late to do the right thing. Help me find a catalyst.

Hall: I am doing the right thing, a completely selfless act. I know that history never celebrates what didn’t happen. They’ll call this a – a tragedy.

The camera pans over to show Ward and Skye looking in the little window on the door.

Hall: They won’t understand the good I did here.

We cut to Coulson, he sees them but keeps his attention on Hall.

Coulson: Killing innocent people?

Hall looks insulted.

Hall: Saving millions. We have to live with the choices we make, but sometimes we have to die with them, too.

Coulson lowers his gun.

Coulson: I understand. You made a hard call.

Hall: Yes.

Coulson: And now I have to make mine.

He fires the gun into the window below them, the one that leads directly into the device. Coulson jumps up and grabs a wire hanging above his head. Hall isn’t so lucky. He drops through the open window and falls into the device. The undulating black mass envelopes Hall in slow motion eventually covering his body and face. Once this happens everything in the room falls into its proper place with gravity returned to normal – this includes Coulson. The door opens and Ward and Skye enter. Coulson looks at the device and Ward and Skye do the same. The undulating black mass is still as it was, no bigger having absorbed Hall, and the rings slow to a stop. Skye and Ward both shoot a look to Coulson then look back at the device.

Cut to some sort of security footage. There is a young looking man on the screen and Coulson is speaking to him from The Bus.

Coulson: Say it back to me.

Young Agent: Deepest level of the fridge, unmarked vault, no access granted.

Behind the Young Agent a forklift is backing up then pulling away, we can see the device has just be unloaded from it.

Coulson: And no recorded entry, I don’t want this listed. I don’t want it flagged for the slingshot.

We can now see that it looks like the device was loaded onto a truck, they are closing the doors in the background.

Coulson: Anyone finds out, you’re responsible, and suffering. Understood?

Young Agent: Yes, Sir.

Coulson: That’s what Hall would’ve wanted.

We hear a beep of the feed cutting out and Coulson turns to his desk and sighs. He picks up his gun and looks at it with confusion.

Coulson: I used to have this down.

He is obviously still caught up in the fact that he couldn’t disarm the gun on the beach earlier. He’s trying to do it with his own pistol.

Coulson: Should be just muscle memory.

He’s having no luck. We hear May’s voice off screen.

May: You’re making a habit of it, sir.

May is standing in the doorway leaning against it with her arms crossed.

Coulson: Trying. Guess I’m a little rusty.

May: Of these close calls, I mean.

Coulson looks up from his gun at her words.

May: I don’t enjoy running back end.

Coulson turns to face her after setting down his gun.

Coulson: You want off the plane? Go ahead.

May stands up straight and walks toward Coulson.

May: I want in.

She stops before him and puts her hands behind her back, standing up straight.

May: Reporting for combat next time it’s up.

Coulson: You committed to the cause or just watching my back?

She gives a ghost of a smile.

May: Same thing.

She starts away.

May: And you are a little rusty.

With that she leaves as Coulson smiles.

Cut to the cargo area, Skye is there punching the bag. Ward enters from above and looks down at her with a smile. After a second he walks down the stairs. Skye shows no indication he’s there, but she knows. While they speak she continues to hit the bag.

Skye: You and your brothers, where’d you grow up?

Ward: Massachusetts, mostly.

Skye: A house?

Ward: You didn’t?

This question causes her to stop hitting, she steadies the bag and looks at Ward.

Skye: One house.

She walks away from the bag messing with the tape around her hands. She passed by Ward still standing on the last stair, when she does he follows after.

Skye: The Brodys.

She picks up a water bottle taking a drink.

Skye: I was 9. Sent me back to St. Agnes after a month. Said I wasn’t a good fit.

Ward: Foster parents. Your first?

Skye: My third.

Ward walks a bit closer to her.

Skye: I had heard it before, but…this one was different.

She looks down sadly.

Ward: Cause you wanted them to like you.

Now she looks up at Ward, he gets it, and she nods.

Skye: Bad.

She looks away seeming lost in the memories.

Skye: I called her “mom” once, tried it out.

She lets out a deep sigh then walks back over to the bag.

Skye: Guess it wasn’t a good fit.

She begins to hit the bag again.

Skye: Hoping for something and losing it hurts more than never hoping for anything.

Ward walks over to the bag and holds the opposite side from Skye. After a second she looks at him.

Ward: We won’t turn our back.

Skye: Doesn’t matter. I made my choice. I want this. Bad.

She gets into punching, Ward nods and holds the bag tighter.

Skye: And I know there’s a truth serum.

Ward: Whatever you say, Rookie.

Title logo.

Cut to some sort of vault. Inside is the black undulating box, it is housed inside a clear glass box. Two men push the heavy vault door shut as we cut inside the vault. We see the black mass from the backside as the Young Agent watches on as the vault is closed. The camera pans down to the mass and we watch it ripple and move.

We cut outside the vault, the two men get the door closed and spin the wheels locking it. The two men move away ad Young Agent walks to the door. He twists one of the wheels more securing the lock. There is a marker on the door: L23-826-59. Young Agent removes the marker from the door. He puts it inside a inside coat pocket and walks away.

Cut to inside the vault, we are once again looking at the black mass from the backside. It continues to ripple when suddenly a hand shoots out of it reaching before it is suddenly sucked back inside the mass.",Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,1963,"[63, 63, 67, 72, 81, 90]",6

564,Meditation (Meditacao),"In my loneliness, when you're gone and I'm all by myself and I need your caress
I just think of you, and the thought of you holding me near
Makes my loneliness soon disappear
Though you're far away, I have only to close my eyes and you are back to stay
I just close my eyes and the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings
Yes I love you so, and that for me is all I need to know
I will wait for you till the sun falls from out of the sky, for what else can I do
I will wait for you, meditating how sweet life will be when you come back to me",Frank Sinatra,1963,"[79, 74, 72, 66, 72, 74, 91, 81, 99, 100]",10

Ha, there goes the funny man
The life of the party, that's me

And they'd never guess
That I had a care
They'd be amazed to see me cry
When the party's through
Cry over you

Talk loud, funny man
In the crowd, funny man
You're in rare form today

Leave em' laughing as you walk away, yeah, yeah
But they wouldn't laugh
If they only knew that I'll go home alone
To cry, cry the whole night through
Cry over you

And who's to know that this clever clown
Is really the fool of a town?
Yes, who's to know the girl I loved
Laughed when she turned me down?

So, tell a joke, funny man
Be gay, funny man
Don't give yourself away, funny man
Pretend you didn't love her anyway

566,Don't Mention My Name,"[Verse 1]
Got caught in a moment, nothing was the same
If I thought you'd notice, I'd mention your name
But you're out of the picture, I can't still picture the fame
But I really miss you, I put the issues to flame
I can't, no I can't do it, I quit
I can't stay when you acting so righteous
I ain't play with you fucking nigga
Just rolling papers and lying faces on some broken bitches
Rolling papers and palm faking on some ugly niggas
Look, I ain't fucking with ya
Oh, woah

[Verse 2]
Not into the mystery, if you selling dreams
And you're somewhere listening, then you so damn mean
And since we both ain't shit niggas, then you can go to hell with me
I know I played a lot of love games with ya, I can't stand when the game plays me
I know I played a lot of love games with ya, I can't stand when the game plays me

[Chorus]
I don't want stress, I don't want press

'Cause you be dropping names
Don't mention my name, yeah
'Cause you running games
Don't mention my name

567,Not For All The Money In The World,"[Intro: Rick Ross]
You know gettin' money, becomin' a young millionaire
You can lose sight of the things that is important to you
I'd never trade my old girl for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my daughter Toy for all the money in the world
I'd never trade my only boy for all the money in the world
I put my last name first

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I can hear my daddy sayin' ""lil' nigga go get 'em""
Passed in '99 cancer all in his liver
Shit different since we last spoke, his son's a lil richer
I'd never rap again if I could tell him that I miss him
Why the fuck I own the world when I can't share it with him
Bust his ass his whole life, just want to break bread with him
Cryin' in my mansion as I'm holdin' on his picture
It's a cold and lonely world, I'm flyin' solo on you niggas
Bein' the only boy, definition of a man
All the money in the world still not a big enough advance
Still all the money in the world still not big enough advance
For me to turn my back on me bein' the man that I am

Tryna figure out where I'm goin' with my life
As I'm steppin' on the brake and hangin' a sharp right
Did my thing in the streets, seen in the streets
See me at the park on the swing with my niece
Watch chipped up, still won't switch up

573,Alice In Wonderland,"[Verse 1]
Yo I was, raised on a seperate side of the track in the land where the wild things roam
Open up my closet see a tall leaf growin, pick a leaf off of the stem take it all to the dome
Callin it, the Alice in Wonderland, spiralin down the medium better known as time I'm stumblin
Come back to my senses from the sounds of thunderin, trees talkin to me wonderin if ill ever come again
Every single day until I'm seein the sun again
Starin at the ripples skippin rocks in the pond again
Stimulatin every single cell while I'm ponderin
And the green leaves are fallin and shrivelin like the Summer end
What shall I do, where do I go
I want the fumes in put the towel under the door
I'm feelin the dro, puff it in and releasin the smoke
Its not enough for me, I want it if u got it fa sho
There are, things talkin to me mommy I swear
I'm seein figures in the dark get up and nobodys there
Intangible shadows are fucking with me reaching for nuthin
So I take a hit of this Alice now I'm hopin for somethin
Fuck all the puffin, elmer it up get to the huffin
Treat it like christmas turkeys open up and get to the stuffin
See if I'm bluffin, I'm ready to go to the moon
Ill do whatever whenever promise it'll get me there soon

[Hook]
I'm lost in my own mind, where do I go
I swear This wonderland's not what I used to know
(voices in my head telling me to go to)
Wonderland (blisseded up feel the smoke run my hands
Wonderland (twisted up, sip it chop it if you in)
Wonderland (Sit back let me how show u how it begin)
Wonderland (where my mind I think I lost in the end)

[Verse 2]
Take me to the twilight zone, no lights on
At the altitude where u be seein all the kites flown,(YEAH)
Family concerned and convinced that my mind gone
And they right, last night first class flights gone,HEY
Mommy why the fuck the flowypier gotta mouth now
Conversatin why I'm layin on the ground now
About face told me to get out now
See the revolution of tomorrow in the clouds now
So far gone, but I'm not Drizzy
Cleveland's own but I'm not Bizzy
Nope no bone well then who is he?
I don't even know anymore I swear I done went crazy (BAHH)
All this talk about the life and the ice in the right hands could get u the dream and a nice tan
But they don't say is the price is ya life plus a slice of ya soul as man and ya right hand
21 as long the cards set right
Drop on my saliva gave my card deck life
Queen of hearts tryna take away my best type
The Ace of Spade make a muthafucka bet right
Creepy crawlers tryna sneak up gimme bed bites
Hide under the cover keep intruders out my bed life
Hug the pillow keep it tucked under my head tight
So the toothfairy cannot get up in my head, night

Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know

Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Hook 3: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

1 A PROLOGUE 1
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.

NARRATOR
In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
effort to normalize relations with
the Carter Administration -- opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
apparent intention of letting some
of his people join their relatives
in the United States. Within seventy-
two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it
became evident that Castro was forcing
the boat owners to carry back with
them not only their relatives but the
dregs of his jail population. 3y the
time the port was closed 125,000
'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
An estimated 25,000 had criminal
records. This is the story of that
minority -- those they call 'Los
Bandidos.'

The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stilleto and in the empty black void we:

We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
then. We move to the eyes, pure in their fury. Finally we
encompass the face -- the face of a man about to explode --
muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.
He is clothed in rags crossed with holes, his shoes broken
cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
prison.

Tony, five minutes later, in a phone booth, in the middle of
._ a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
trying still to contact somebody -- anybody -- on the outside.

Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot- As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling. Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His
expression alters to uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ..Hello?..Who is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes
somebody in another phone booth and goes over.

Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a

The blonde has paused to look in a shop window.

Manny stops alongside, pretends to look. When he catches
her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
child, four, toddling along with it's'mom. Be makes his
own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
him puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now
smiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles
and moves along.

Meanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests
something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It

A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security
and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury
items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes
quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,
dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now
Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the
heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and
bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

LOPEZ
How ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet
you. How 'bout a drink?

TONY
Mr. Lopez... real pleasure.

LOPEZ
Call me Frank, Tony. Everybody
calls me Frank. My Little League
team, even the prosecutors 'round

Still a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place,
his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps
forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin,
which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.

Subtitle appears:

COCHABAMBA, BOLIVA
Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive iron
kettles bubbling with coca paste...across to a row of ovens
where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey"" as he
passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
vineyard.

SOSA

&&A guarantee production of 200
kilos refined every month of the

market. Some months I can't get rid
of fifty keys, other months I have to

Nobody can run a business that way ---

OMAR
I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got
the same problems up in Miami, the
demand varies for us too, month to
month....
Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his
skinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

Tow, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to
look at a sample of the dried coke.
The Shadow stops, eyeballs him.

Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause. His
expression says I like it. He moves on.
The Shadow moves with him.
SOSA
(meanwhile)
...Basically what I'm looking for is
somebody to share the risks with me,
somebody in the States who might
guarantee me something like-.-say
150 kilos a month.

to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impas-
sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar
and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the
glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements
of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-
stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
light drawing immediate laughter.
He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
the music suddenly shifts upbeat to ""Saturday Night Fever""

shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
face of a young clown in white paint with the large
blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
audience.
Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
everybody is merry...

...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His
antennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
The two hitters moving on him.
He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
smashing the mirrors....
Screams, crowd diving for cover....
Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
his ankle, firing....
Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
ceilings....
Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
mirrors, and more screaming.
Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass.
The clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.

Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
lot, he runs out of ammunition.
He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
towards him.
The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
Carhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
exploding like squashed watermelon.

Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
across the shattered windows.
He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
gear shift into reverse.
In an instant, his warmobile in reverse,
accelerates
climbing to top speed....
As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

...the question is how with a small
law enforcement budget do you put a
dent in an estimated $100 billion a

all you can do is put your finger in
the dike and pray but now we are
hearing voices that say the only way
we can solve the drug problem is the
same way Prohibition was solved.
Not by outlawing the substances but
by legalizing and taxing them. These
voices say that will drive out the

smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who

You call yourself a man! What makes
you so much better than me, what do
you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a
real contribution to human history.
You want a kid. What kind of father
do you think you'd make, Tony? What
kind of stories are you going to
tell the kid before he goes to sleep
at night? You going to drive him to
school in the mornings, Tony? You
really think you're still going to
be alive by the time he goes to
school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony,
you're dreaming!
The audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
the faces of Vie and his rich friends.

Tony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.

TONY
Sit down before I kill you.

ELVXRA
* . . You think of yourself as a husband,
too, Tony. But did you ever stay
home without having six of your goons

Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass

the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an

Bullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering
her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
intervals.

distance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.

Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the

A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
him over the balustrade.

The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
pool below.

Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots (X

moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
looking questioningly in her face.

Hey Gina come on, you still angry at

He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
up at the monitor.
On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the

I know how you feel; you think her love is real

You think this time you've got a paper heart

When she starts to tear it apart -
That's when she'll let you go

Here she comes that little town flirt
You're falling for her
And you're gonna get hurt
Yeah
I know it's so hard to resist
The temptation of her tender red lips

But you can get hurt
Hurt
Yeah
You can get a hurt

Fooling around with that little town flirt

593,That's The Way Love Is,"[Verse 1]
Ah baby
After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
You're left alone and broken-hearted
Love just comes and it goes
How long it's going to last nobody knows

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, sugar
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is my love

[Verse 2]
Yeah now
I know you're walking down a lonesome road
And your heart is carrying a heavy load
I know you feel like you haven't got a friend (Haven't got a friend)
And your whole world's caving in (Caving in)
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (To be strong)
You better forget him now that he's gone (Now that he's gone)
And remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, honey
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is
Oh, that''s how it is my love
Ooh baby

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Listen to me, little darling
The road of love is rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
I've been hurt by love so many times
So I know just what you're going through
You wish that you were never born
You better forget him now that he's gone
Just remember

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, honey, yeah
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is

[Verse 4]
Wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)",Marvin Gaye,1963,"[62, 33, 34, 37, 39, 45, 38, 60, 80, 81]",10
594,As Long As She Needs Me,"As long as she needs me
I know where I must be
I'll cling on steadfastly
As long as she needs me

As long as life is long
I'll love her right or wrong
And somehow, I'll be strong
As long as she needs me

If you are lonely
Then you will know
When someone needs you
You love them so
I won't betray that trust
Though people say I must
I've got to stay true just
As long as she needs me

Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8
With no time to be at work at 9
She'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute

[Hook]

[Hook: John Legend]
Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked
No more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging
My premonition, told me I got what you're missing
So let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying

596,Nothing Goes Up (Without Coming Down),"Remember my party, remember my party, said Peter Walsh as he stepped down the street, speaking to himself rhythmically, in time with the flow of the sound, the direct downright sound of Big Ben striking the half-hour. (The leaden circles dissolved in the air.) Oh these parties, he thought; Clarissa’s parties. Why does she give these parties, he thought. Not that he blamed her or this effigy of a man in a tail-coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards him. Only one person in the world could be as he was, in love. And there he was, this fortunate man, himself, reflected in the plate-glass window of a motor-car manufacturer in Victoria Street. All India lay behind him; plains, mountains; epidemics of cholera; a district twice as big as Ireland; decisions he had come to alone — he, Peter Walsh; who was now really for the first time in his life, in love. Clarissa had grown hard, he thought; and a trifle sentimental into the bargain, he suspected, looking at the great motor-cars capable of doing — how many miles on how many gallons? For he had a turn for mechanics; had invented a plough in his district, had ordered wheel-barrows from England, but the coolies wouldn’t use them, all of which Clarissa knew nothing whatever about.
The way she said “Here is my Elizabeth!”— that annoyed him. Why not “Here’s Elizabeth” simply? It was insincere. And Elizabeth didn’t like it either. (Still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him; the half-hour; still early; only half-past eleven still.) For he understood young people; he liked them. There was always something cold in Clarissa, he thought. She had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes conventionality, and then it’s all up, it’s all up, he thought, looking rather drearily into the glassy depths, and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her; overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool; wept; been emotional; told her everything, as usual, as usual.
As a cloud crosses the sun, silence falls on London; and falls on the mind. Effort ceases. Time flaps on the mast. There we stop; there we stand. Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame. Where there is nothing, Peter Walsh said to himself; feeling hollowed out, utterly empty within. Clarissa refused me, he thought. He stood there thinking, Clarissa refused me.
Ah, said St. Margaret’s, like a hostess who comes into her drawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says. Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present. It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret’s glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest — like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and an extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment. But what room? What moment? And why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking? Then, as the sound of St. Margaret’s languished, he thought, She has been ill, and the sound expressed languor and suffering. It was her heart, he remembered; and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life, Clarissa falling where she stood, in her drawing-room. No! No! he cried. She is not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending, his future.
He was not old, or set, or dried in the least. As for caring what they said of him — the Dalloways, the Whitbreads, and their set, he cared not a straw — not a straw (though it was true he would have, some time or other, to see whether Richard couldn’t help him to some job). Striding, staring, he glared at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge. He had been sent down from Oxford — true. He had been a Socialist, in some sense a failure — true. Still the future of civilisation lies, he thought, in the hands of young men like that; of young men such as he was, thirty years ago; with their love of abstract principles; getting books sent out to them all the way from London to a peak in the Himalayas; reading science; reading philosophy. The future lies in the hands of young men like that, he thought.
A patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind, and with it a rustling, regular thudding sound, which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts, strict in step, up Whitehall, without his doing. Boys in uniform, carrying guns, marched with their eyes ahead of them, marched, their arms stiff, and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty, gratitude, fidelity, love of England.
It is, thought Peter Walsh, beginning to keep step with them, a very fine training. But they did not look robust. They were weedy for the most part, boys of sixteen, who might, to-morrow, stand behind bowls of rice, cakes of soap on counters. Now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from Finsbury Pavement to the empty tomb. They had taken their vow. The traffic respected it; vans were stopped.
I can’t keep up with them, Peter Walsh thought, as they marched up Whitehall, and sure enough, on they marched, past him, past every one, in their steady way, as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly, and life, with its varieties, its irreticences, had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline. One had to respect it; one might laugh; but one had to respect it, he thought. There they go, thought Peter Walsh, pausing at the edge of the pavement; and all the exalted statues, Nelson, Gordon, Havelock, the black, the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them, as if they too had made the same renunciation (Peter Walsh felt he too had made it, the great renunciation), trampled under the same temptations, and achieved at length a marble stare. But the stare Peter Walsh did not want for himself in the least; though he could respect it in others. He could respect it in boys. They don’t know the troubles of the flesh yet, he thought, as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the Strand — all that I’ve been through, he thought, crossing the road, and standing under Gordon’s statue, Gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped; Gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed — poor Gordon, he thought.
And just because nobody yet knew he was in London, except Clarissa, and the earth, after the voyage, still seemed an island to him, the strangeness of standing alone, alive, unknown, at half-past eleven in Trafalgar Square overcame him. What is it? Where am I? And why, after all, does one do it? he thought, the divorce seeming all moonshine. And down his mind went flat as a marsh, and three great emotions bowled over him; understanding; a vast philanthropy; and finally, as if the result of the others, an irrepressible, exquisite delight; as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled, shutters moved, and he, having nothing to do with it, yet stood at the opening of endless avenues, down which if he chose he might wander. He had not felt so young for years.
He had escaped! was utterly free — as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind, like an unguarded flame, bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding. I haven’t felt so young for years! thought Peter, escaping (only of course for an hour or so) from being precisely what he was, and feeling like a child who runs out of doors, and sees, as he runs, his old nurse waving at the wrong window. But she’s extraordinarily attractive, he thought, as, walking across Trafalgar Square in the direction of the Haymarket, came a young woman who, as she passed Gordon’s statue, seemed, Peter Walsh thought (susceptible as he was), to shed veil after veil, until she became the very woman he had always had in mind; young, but stately; merry, but discreet; black, but enchanting.
Straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket-knife he started after her to follow this woman, this excitement, which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them, which singled him out, as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name, not Peter, but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts. “You,” she said, only “you,” saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders. Then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past Dent’s shop in Cockspur Street blew out with an enveloping kindness, a mournful tenderness, as of arms that would open and take the tired —
But she’s not married; she’s young; quite young, thought Peter, the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across Trafalgar Square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red. But she waited at the kerbstone. There was a dignity about her. She was not worldly, like Clarissa; not rich, like Clarissa. Was she, he wondered as she moved, respectable? Witty, with a lizard’s flickering tongue, he thought (for one must invent, must allow oneself a little diversion), a cool waiting wit, a darting wit; not noisy.
She moved; she crossed; he followed her. To embarrass her was the last thing he wished. Still if she stopped he would say “Come and have an ice,” he would say, and she would answer, perfectly simply, “Oh yes.”
But other people got between them in the street, obstructing him, blotting her out. He pursued; she changed. There was colour in her cheeks; mockery in her eyes; he was an adventurer, reckless, he thought, swift, daring, indeed (landed as he was last night from India) a romantic buccaneer, careless of all these damned proprieties, yellow dressing-gowns, pipes, fishing-rods, in the shop windows; and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats. He was a buccaneer. On and on she went, across Piccadilly, and up Regent Street, ahead of him, her cloak, her gloves, her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement, as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness.
Laughing and delightful, she had crossed Oxford Street and Great Portland Street and turned down one of the little streets, and now, and now, the great moment was approaching, for now she slackened, opened her bag, and with one look in his direction, but not at him, one look that bade farewell, summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly, for ever, had fitted her key, opened the door, and gone! Clarissa’s voice saying, Remember my party, Remember my party, sang in his ears. The house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower-baskets of vague impropriety. It was over.
Well, I’ve had my fun; I’ve had it, he thought, looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums. And it was smashed to atoms — his fun, for it was half made up, as he knew very well; invented, this escapade with the girl; made up, as one makes up the better part of life, he thought — making oneself up; making her up; creating an exquisite amusement, and something more. But odd it was, and quite true; all this one could never share — it smashed to atoms.
He turned; went up the street, thinking to find somewhere to sit, till it was time for Lincoln’s Inn — for Messrs. Hooper and Grateley. Where should he go? No matter. Up the street, then, towards Regent’s Park. His boots on the pavement struck out “no matter”; for it was early, still very early.
It was a splendid morning too. Like the pulse of a perfect heart, life struck straight through the streets. There was no fumbling — no hesitation. Sweeping and swerving, accurately, punctually, noiselessly, there, precisely at the right instant, the motor-car stopped at the door. The girl, silk-stockinged, feathered, evanescent, but not to him particularly attractive (for he had had his fling), alighted. Admirable butlers, tawny chow dogs, halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing, Peter saw through the opened door and approved of. A splendid achievement in its own way, after all, London; the season; civilisation. Coming as he did from a respectable Anglo-Indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent (it’s strange, he thought, what a sentiment I have about that, disliking India, and empire, and army as he did), there were moments when civilisation, even of this sort, seemed dear to him as a personal possession; moments of pride in England; in butlers; chow dogs; girls in their security. Ridiculous enough, still there it is, he thought. And the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business, punctual, alert, robust, seemed to him wholly admirable, good fellows, to whom one would entrust one’s life, companions in the art of living, who would see one through. What with one thing and another, the show was really very tolerable; and he would sit down in the shade and smoke.
There was Regent’s Park. Yes. As a child he had walked in Regent’s Park — odd, he thought, how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me — the result of seeing Clarissa, perhaps; for women live much more in the past than we do, he thought. They attach themselves to places; and their fathers — a woman’s always proud of her father. Bourton was a nice place, a very nice place, but I could never get on with the old man, he thought. There was quite a scene one night — an argument about something or other, what, he could not remember. Politics presumably.
Yes, he remembered Regent’s Park; the long straight walk; the little house where one bought air-balls to the left; an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other. He looked for an empty seat. He did not want to be bothered (feeling a little drowsy as he did) by people asking him the time. An elderly grey nurse, with a baby asleep in its perambulator — that was the best he could do for himself; sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse.
She’s a queer-looking girl, he thought, suddenly remembering Elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother. Grown big; quite grown-up, not exactly pretty; handsome rather; and she can’t be more than eighteen. Probably she doesn’t get on with Clarissa. “There’s my Elizabeth”— that sort of thing — why not “Here’s Elizabeth” simply? — trying to make out, like most mothers, that things are what they’re not. She trusts to her charm too much, he thought. She overdoes it.
The rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat; he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment; blue, circular — I shall try and get a word alone with Elizabeth to-night, he thought — then began to wobble into hour-glass shapes and taper away; odd shapes they take, he thought. Suddenly he closed his eyes, raised his hand with an effort, and threw away the heavy end of his cigar. A great brush swept smooth across his mind, sweeping across it moving branches, children’s voices, the shuffle of feet, and people passing, and humming traffic, rising and falling traffic. Down, down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep, sank, and was muffled over.",Virginia Woolf,1963,"[87, 100, 90]",3

Welcome to the year of the cyco
It's been a long, long wait
Welcome to a modern blitzkrieg
With peace, I can't relate
Welcome to death now you'll love it
Once in a lifetime treat
Say goodbye to peace and order
You and my terror will meet

My best friend is misery
My girlfriend is insanity
My father is revenge

My love for you I must confess
With my knife you passed the test
I'll love you till the end

Evacuation of my mind
In my body no heart you'll find
Where there's death I lurk

Empty stare incoherent
Screams of pain, love to hear it
Take pride in my work

They say two wrongs don't make a right
Well maybe that is true
But I can't describe the feeling I get
When I take revenge on you

Forgiveness is the key to destruction
But you can't open my door
Repentance, you're indecision
I hesitate no more
Tradition is the root of all evil
So now I water the tree
Salvation, an all-time sentence
So now I walk away free

But they make me feel a whole lot better",Suicidal Tendencies,1963,[100],1

Everything went my way, life was a ball
But then you came along and changed it all

Hey, yo, cutie what's up with this attitude?
I thought I was being real good to you
I treat you sweet, take you out at night
But you never say thanks, girl, that ain't right
I bought you diamonds even gave you pearls
I took you for a cruise all around the world
I treat you high-post but you play me close
And if I put a drink up, you won't even toast

Girl, I work so hard for you from nine to five
So you could have the finer things in life
Since you're the kind that's never satisfied

I'm a real troop trooper aiming for the top
And with you by my side, d-dollars I will clock

Lo to the fact that I want you, Jackie
I want you more than human eyes can see

623,"The 2,000 Pound Bee (Part 2)","                                          Capital, Volume One

                                                KARL MARX

Capital (Das Kapital) was Marx's magnum opus, Volume One, published in 1867, is the book generally referred to simply as Capital and is relatively complete in itself.

        The following selections from it, together with Marx's Preface to the first German edition, Afterword to the second, and Preface to the French edition, are taken from the text of the English edition of 1 887, as translated from the third German edition by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling and edited by Engels. An attempt has been made here to provide those sections of the book that collectively convey the basic argument and the most characteristic themes. In some instances Marx's footnotes have been deleted in the interest of saving space.

                                Preface to the First German Edition

        The work, the first volume of which I now submit to the public, forms the continuation of my ""Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie"" (A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy) published in 1859. The long pa use between the first part and the continuation is due to an illness of many years' duration that again and again interrupted my work.

        The substance of that earlier work is summarized in the first three chapters of this volume. This is done not merely for the sake of connation and completeness. The presentation of the subject-matter is improved. As far as circumstances any way permit, many points only hinted at in the earlier book are here worked out more fully, whilst, conversely, points worked out fully there are only touched upon in this volume. The sections on the history of the theories of value and o f money are now, of course, left out altogether. The reader of the earlier work will find, however, in the notes to the first chapter additional sources of reference relative to the history of those theories.

        That beginning is difficult holds in all sciences. To understand the first chapter, especially the section that contains the analysis of commodities, will, therefore, present the greatest difficulty. That which concerns more especially the analysis of the substance of value and the magnitude of value, I have, as much as it was possible, popularized. The value-form, whose fully developed shape is the money-form, is very elementary and simple. Nevertheless, the human mind has for more than 2,000 years sought in vain to get to the bottom of it, whilst on the other hand, to the successful analysis of much more composite and complex forms, there has been at least an approximation. Why? Because the body as an organic whole is easy of study than are the cells of that body, in the analysis of economic forms, moreover, neither microscopes nor chemical reagents are of use. The force of abstraction must replace both. But in bourgeois society the commodity-form of the product of labouror the value-form of the commodity-is the economic cell-form. To the superficial observer, the analysis of these forms seems to turn upon minute. It does in fact deal with minute, but they are of the same order as those dealt with in microscopic anatomy.

        With the exception of the section on value-form, therefore, this volume cannot stand accused on the score of difficulty. I presuppose, of course, a reader who is willing to learn something new and therefore to think for himself.

        The physicist either observes physical phenomena where they occur in their most typical form and most free from disturbing influence, or, wherever possible, he makes experiments under conditions that assure the occurrence of the phenomenon in its normality. In this work I have to examine the capitalist mode of production, and the conditions of production and exchange corresponding to that mode. Up to the present time, their classic ground is England. That is the reason why England is used as the chief illustration in the development of my theoretical ideas. If, however, the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist fashion, comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him,""De te fabula narratur!""

        Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher o r lower degree of development of the social antagonisms that result from the natural law of capitalist production. It is a question of these laws themselves, of the tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results. The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed the image of its own future.

        But apart from this, Where capitalist production is fully naturalized among the Germans (for instance, in the factories proper) the condition of things is much worse than in England, because the counterpoise of the Factory Acts is wanting. In all other spheres, we, like all the rest of Continental Western Europe, suffer not only from the development of capitalist production, but also from the incompleteness of that development. Alongside of modern evils, a whole series of inherited evils oppress us, arising from the passive survival of antiquated modes of production, with their inevitable train of social and political anachronisms. We suffer not only from the living, but from the dead. Le mort saisit le vif!

        The social statistics of Germany and the rest of Continental Western Europe are, in comparison with those of England, wretchedly compiled. But they raise the veil just enough to let us catch a glimpse of the Medusa head behind it. We should be appalled at the state of things at home, if, as in England, our governments and parliaments appointed periodically commissions of inquiry into economic conditions; if these commissions were armed with the same plenary powers to get at the truth; if it was possible to find for this purpose men as competent, as free from partisanship and respect of persons as are the English factory inspectors her medical reporters on public health, her commissioners of inquiry into the exploitation o f women and children, in to housing and food .Pursues wore a magic cap that the monsters he hunted down might not see him. We draw the magic cap down over eyes and ears as make-believe that there are no monsters.

        Let us not deceive ourselves on this, As in the 18th century, the American war of independence sounded the tocsin for the European middle-class, so in the 19th century, the American Civil War sounded it for the European working-class. In England the progress of social disintegration is palpable. When it has reached a certain point, it must re-act on the Continent. There it will take a form more brutal or more humane, according to the degree of development of the working-class itself. Apart from higher motives, therefore, their own most important interests dictate to the classes that are for the nonce the ruling ones, the removal of all legally removable hindrances to the free development of the working-class. For this reason, as well as others, I have given so large a space in this volume to the history, the details, and the results of English factory legislation. One nation can and should learn from others. And even when a society has got upon the right track for the discovery of the natural laws of its movement-and it is the ultimate aim of this work, to lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society-it can neither clear by bold leaps, nor remove by legal enactments, the obstacles offered by the successive phases of its normal development. But it can shorten and lessen the birth-pangs.

        To prevent possible misunderstanding a word, I paint the capitalist and the landlord in no sense couleur de rose. But here individuals are dealt with only in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, embodiments of particular class-relations and class-interests. My standpoint, from which the evolution of the economic formation of society is viewed as a process of natural history, can less than any other make the individual responsible for relations whose creature he socially remains, however much he may subjectively raise himself above them.

        In the domain of Political Economy, free scientific inquiry meets not merely the same enemies as in all other domains. The peculiar nature of the material it deals with, summons as foes into the field of battle the most violent, mean and malignant passions of the human breast, the Furies of private interest. The English Established Church, e.g., will more readily pardon an attack on 38 of its 39 articles than o n 1/39 of its income. Now-a-days atheism itself is culpa levis, as compared with criticism of existing property relations. Nevertheless, there is an unmistakable advance. I refer, e.g., to the Blue book published within the last few weeks: ""Correspondence with Her Majesty's Missions Abroad, regarding Industrial Questions and Trades' Unions."" The representatives of the English Crown in foreign countries there declare in so many words that in Germany, in France, to be brief, in all the civilized states of the European Continent, a radical change in the existing relations between capital and labour is as evident and inevitable as in England. At the same time, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Mr. Wade, vice-president of the United States, declared in public meetings that, after the abolition of salvery, a radical change of the relations of capital and of property in land is next upon the order of the day. These are signs of the times, not to be hidden by purple mantles or black cassocks. They do not signify that tomorrow a miracle will happen. They show that, within the ruling-classes themselves, a foreboding is dawning, that the present society is no solid crystal, but an organism capable of change, and is constantly changing.

        The second volume of this work will treat of the process of the circulation of capital (Book II.), and of the varied forms assumed by capital in the course of its development (Book III.), the third and last volume (Book IV.), the history of the theory.

        Every opinion based on scientific criticism I welcome. As to the prejudices of so-called public opinion, to which I have never made concessions, now as aforetime the maxim of the great Florentine is mine:
""Segui il tuo corso, e lascia dir le genti.""

London, July 25, 1867                                                            Karl Marx

                                      Preface to the French Edition

                                     To the citizen Maurice LacMtre

Dear Citizen,

        I applaud your idea of publishing the translation of ""Das Kapital"" as a serial. In this form the book will be more accessible to the working-class, a consideration which to me outweighs everything else.

        That is the good side of y our suggestion, but here is the reverse of the medal: the method of analysis which I have employed, and which had not previously been applied to economic subjects, makes the reading of the first chapters rather arduous, and it is to be feared that the French public, always impatient to come to a conclusion, eager to know the connation between general principles and the immediate questions that have aroused their passions, may be disheartened because they will be unable to move on at once.

        That is a disadvantage I am powerless to overcome, unless it be by forewarning and forearming those readers who zealously seek the truth. There is no royal to science, and only those who do not dread the fatiguing climb of its steep paths have a chance of gaining its luminous summits.

                                        Believe me,
                                                                Dear citizen
                                                                                        You’re devoted,
London, March 18, 1872                                                                         Karl Marx

                   From the Afterword to the Second German Edition

        That the method employed in ""Das Kapital"" has been little understood is shown by the various conceptions, contradictory one to another, that have been formed of it.

        Thus the Paris Revue Positiviste reproaches me in that, on the one hand, I treat economics metaphysically, and on the other hand-imagine!-confine myself to the mere critical analysis of actual facts, instead of writing receipts (Comtist ones ?) for the cook-shops of the future. In answer to the reproach in re metaphysics, Professor Sieber has it: ""In so far as it deals with actual theory, the method of Marx is the deductive method of the whole English school, a school whose failings and virtues are common to the best theoretic economists”. M. BIock - ""Les Theoriciens du Socialismeen Allemagne. Extrait du Journal des Economistes, Juillet et Aout 1872"" - makes the discovery that my method is analytic and says: ""Par cet ouvrage M. Marx se classe parmi les esprits analytiques lesplus eminents."" German reviews, of course, shriek out at ""Hegelian sophistics."" The European Messenger of St. Petersburg in an article dealing exclusively with the method of ""Das Kapital"" (May number, 1872, pp. 427-436), finds my method of inquiry severely realistic, but my method of presentation, unfortunately, Germandialectical. It says: ""At first sight, if the judgment is based on the external form of the presentation of the subject, Marx is the most ideal of ideal philosophers, always in the German, i.e., the bad sense of the word. But in point of fact he is infinitely more realistic than all his fore-runners in the work of economic criticism. He can in no sense be called an idealist. ""I cannot answer the writer better than by aid of a few extracts from h is own criticism, which may interest some of my readers to whom the Russian original is inaccessible.

        After a quotation from the preface to my ""Criticism of Political Economy, ""Berlin, 1859, pp. IV-VI I, where I discuss the materialistic basis of my method, the writer goes on: ""The one thing which is of moment to Marx, is to find the law of the phenomena with whose investigation he is concerned; and not only is that law of moment to him, which governs these phenomena, in so far as they have a definite form and mutual connexions within a given historical period. Of still greater moment to him is the law of their variation, of their development, i.e., of their transition from one form into another, from one series of connexions into a different one. This law once discovered, he investigates in detail the effects in which it manifests itself in social life. Consequently, Marx only troubles himself about one thing: to show, by rigid scientific investigation, the necessity of successive determinate orders of social conditions, and to establish, as impartially as possible, the facts that serve him for fundamental starting-points. For this it is quite enough, if he proves, at the same time, both the necessity of the present order of things, and the necessity of another order into which the first must inevitably pass over, and this all the same, whether men believe or do not believe it, whether they are conscious or unconscious of it. Marx treats the social movement as a process of natural history, governed by laws not only independent of human will, consciousness and intelligence, but rather, on the contrary, determining that will, consciousness and intelligence . . . . If in the history of civilization the conscious element plays a part so subordinate, then it is self-evident that a critical inquiry, whose subject-matter is civilization, can, less than anything else, has for its basis any form of, or any result of, consciousness. That is to say, that not the idea, but the material phenomenon alone can serve as its starting-point. Such an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact, not with ideas, but with another fact. For this inquiry, the one thing of moment is, that both facts be investigated as accurately as possible, and that they actually form, each with respect to the other, different moment of an evolution; but most important of all is the rigid analysis of the series of success ions, of the sequences and concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present themselves. But it will be said, the general laws of economic life are one and the same, no matter whether they are applied to the present or the past. This Marx directly denies. According to him, such abstract laws do not exist. On the contrary, in his opinion every historical period has laws of its own . . . . As soon as society has outlived a given period of development, and is passing over from one given stage to another, it begins to be subject also to other laws. In a word, economic life offers us a phenomenon analogous to the history of evolution in other branches of biology. The old economists misunderstood the nature of economic laws when they likened them to the laws of physics and chemistry. A more thorough analysis of phenomena shows that social organisms differ among themselves as fundamentally as plants or animals. Nay, one and the same phenomenon falls under quite different laws in consequence of the different structure of those organisms as a whole, of the variations of their individual organs, of the different conditions in which those organs function, &c. Marx, e.g., denies that the law of population is the same at all times and in all places. He asserts, on the contrary, that every stage of development has its own law of population. . . . With the varying degree of development of productive power, social conditions and the laws governing them vary too. Whilst Marx sets himself the task of following and explaining from this point of view the economic system established by the sway of capital, he is only formulating, in a strictly scientific manner, the aim that every accurate investigation into economic life must have. The scientific value of such an inquiry lies in the disclosing of the special laws that regulate the origin, existence, development, death of a given social organism and its replacement by another and higher one. And it is this value that, in point of fact, Marx's book has.""

        Whilst the writer pictures what he takes to be actually my method, in this striking and [as far as concerns my own application of it] generous way, what else is he picturing but the dialectic method?

        Of course the method of presentation must differ in form from that of inquiry. The latter has to appropriate the material in detail, to analyze its different forms of development, to trace out their inner connexion. Only after this work is done, can the actual movement be adequately described. If this is done successfully, if the life of the subject-matter is ideally reflected as in a mirror, then it may appear as if we had before us a mere a priori construction.

        My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. To Hegel, the life-process of the human brain, i.e., the process o f thinking, which, under the name of ""the Idea,"" he even transforms into an independent subject, is the demiurges of the real world, and the real world is only the external, phenomenal form of ""the Idea."" With me, on the contrary, the ideal is nothing else than the material world reflected by the human minds, and translated into forms of thought.

        The mystifying side of Hegelian dialectic I criticised nearly thirty years ago, at a time when it was still the fashion. But just as I was working at the first volume of ""Das Kapital,"" it was the good pleasure of the peevish, arrogant, mediocre epigones who now talk large in cultured Germany, to treat Hegel in the same way as the brave Moses Mendelssohn in Lessing's time treated Spinoza, i.e., as a ""dead dog."" I therefore openly avowed myself the pupil of that mighty thinker, a n d even here and there, in the chapter on the theory of value, coquetted- with the modes of expression peculiar to him. The mystification which dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no means prevents him from being the first to p resent its general form of working in a comprehensive and conscious manner. With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.

        In its mystified form, dialectic became the fashion in Germany, because it seemed to transfigure and to glorify the existing state of things. In its rational form it is a scandal and abomination to bourgeoisdom and its doctrinaire professors, because it includes in its comprehension an affirmative recognition of the existing state of things, at the same time also, the recognition of the negation of that state, of its inevitable breaking up; because it regards every historically developed social form as in fluid movement, and therefore takes into account its transient nature not less than its momentary existence; because it lets nothing impose upon it, and is in its essence critical and revolutionary.

        The contradictions inherent in the movement of capitalist society impress themselves upon the practical bourgeois most strikingly in the changes of the periodic cycle, through which modem industry runs, and whose crowning point is the universal crisis. That crisis is once again approaching, although as yet but in its preliminary stage; and by the universality of its theatre and the intensity of its action it will drum dialectics even into the heads of the mushroom-upstarts of the new, holy Prusso-German Empire.

Notes :

1. This is the more necessary, as even the section of Ferdinand Lassalle's work against Schulze Delitzsch, in which he professes to give “the intellectual Quintessence"" of my explanations on these subjects, contains important mistakes. If Ferdinand Lassalle has borrowed almost literally from my Writings, and without any acknowledgement, all the general theoretical propositions in his economic works, e.g., those on the historical character of capital, on the connation between the conditions of production and the mode of production, &c., &c., even to the terminology created by me, this may perhaps be due to purposes of propaganda. I am here, of course, not speaking of his detailed working o u t and application of these propositions, with which I have nothing to do. [Marx]

He thereby became first in line of succession to the presidency during the Johnson administration and in this sense was the equivalent o f a vice president although he did not in fact occupy that office.

                                  Part I. Commodities and Money

                                    CHAPTER I. COMMODITIES

Section 1. The Two Factors of a Commodity: Use-Value and Value (The Substance of Value and the Magnitude of Value)

        The wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as ""an immense accumulation of commodities,"" its unit being a single commodity. Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity.

        A commodity is, in the first place, an object outside us, a thing that by its properties satisfies human wants of some sort or another. The nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference. Neither are we here concerned to know how the object satisfies these wants, whether directly as means of subsistence, or indirectly as means of production.

        Every useful thing, as iron, paper, &c., may be looked at from the two points of view of quality and quantity. It is an assemblage of many properties, and may therefore be of use in various ways. To discover the various uses of things is the work of history. So also is the establishment of socially recognized standards of measure for the quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of these measures has its origin partly in the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, partly in convention.

        The utility of a thing makes it a use-value. But this utility is not a thing of air. Being limited by the physical properties of the commodity, it has no existence apart from that commodity. A commodity, such as iron, corn, or a diamond, is therefore, so far as it is a material thing, a us e-value, something useful. This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities. When treating of use-value, we always assume to be dealing with definite quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron. The use-values of commodities furnish the material for a special study, that of the commercial knowledge of commodities. Use-values become a reality only by use or consumption: they also constitute the substance of all wealth, whatever may be the social form of that wealth. In the form of society we are about to consider, they are, in addition, the material depositories of exchange value.

        Exchange-value, at first sight, presents itself as a quantitative relation, as the proportion in which values in use of one sort are exchanged for those of another sort, a relation constantly changing with time and place. Hence exchange-value appears to be something accidental and purely relative, and consequently an intrinsic value, i.e., an exchange-value that is inseparably connected with, inherent in commodities, seems a contradiction in terms.  Let us consider the matter a little more closely.

        A given commodity, e.g., a quarter of wheat is exchanged for x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c.-in short, for other commodities in the most different proportions. Instead of one exchange-value, the wheat has, therefore, a great many. But since x blacking, y silk, or z gold, &c., each represent the exchange-value of one quarter of wheat, x blacking, y silk, z gold, &c., must, as exchange-values, be replaceable by each other, or equal to each other. Therefore, first: the valid exchange-values of a given commodity express something equal; secondly, exchange-value, generally, is only the mode of expression, the phenomenal form, of something contained in it, yet distinguishable from it.

        Let us take two commodities, e.g., corn and iron, The proportions in which they are exchangeable, whatever those proportions may be, can always b e represented by an equation in which a given quantity of corn is equated to some quantity of iron: e.g., I quarter corn = x cwt. iron. What does this equation tell us? It tells us that in two different things-in I quarter of corn and x cwt. of iron, there exists in equal quantities something common to both. The two things must therefore be equal to a third, which in itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of them, so far as it is exchange value, must therefore be reducible to this third.

        A simple geometrical illustration will make this clear. In order to calculate and compare the areas of rectilinear figures, we decompose them into triangles. But the area of the triangle itself is expressed by something totally different from its visible figure, namely, by half the product of the base into the altitude. In the same way the exchange-values of commodities must be capable of being expressed in terms of something common to them all, of which thing they represent a greater or less quantity.

        This common ""something"" cannot be either a geometrical, a chemical, or any other natural property of commodities. Such properties claim our attention only in so far as they affect the utility of those commodities, make them use-values. But the exchange of commodities is evidently an act characterised by a total abstraction from use-value. Then one use-value is just as good as another, provided only it be present in sufficient quantity. Or, as old Barbon says, ""one sort of wares is as good as another, if the values be equal. There is no difference or distinction in things of equal value. . . . An hundred pounds' worth of lead or iron, is of as great value as one hundred pounds' worth of silver or gold."" As use-values, commodities are, above all, of different qualities, but as exchange-values they are merely different quantities, and consequently do not contain an atom of use-value.

        If then we leave out of consideration the use-value of commodities, they have only one common property left, that of being products of labour. But even the product of labour itself has undergone a change in our hands. If we make abstraction from its use-value, we make abstraction at the same time from the material elements and shapes that make the product a use-value; we see in it no longer a table, a house, yarn, or any other useful thing. Its existence as a material thing is put out of sight. Neither can it any longer be regarded as the product of the labour of the joiner, the mason, the spinner, or of any other definite kind of productive labour. Along with the useful qualities of the products themselves, we put out of sight both the useful character of the various kinds of labour embodied in them, and the concrete forms of that labour; there is nothing left but what is common to them all; all are reduced to one and the same sort of labour, human labour in the abstract.

        Let us now consider the residue of each of these products; it consists of the same unsubstantial reality in each, a mere congelation of homogeneous human labour, of labour-power expended without regard to the mode of its expenditure. All that these things now tell us is, that human labour-power has been expended in their production, that human labour is embodied in them. When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them all, they are-Values.

        We have seen that when commodities are exchanged, their exchange value manifests itself as something totally independent of their use-value. But if we abstract from their use-value, there remains their Value as defined above. Therefore, the common substance that manifests itself in the exchange-value of commodities, whenever they are exchanged, is their value. The progress of our investigation will show that exchange-value is the only form in which the value of commodities can manifest itself or be expressed. For the present, however, we have to consider the nature of value independently of this, its form.

        A use-value, or useful article, therefore, has value only because human labour in the abstract has been embodied or materialised in it. How, then, is the magnitude of this value to be measured? Painly, by the quantity of the value-creating substance the labour contained in the article. The quantity of labour, however, is measured by its duration, and labour-time in its turn finds its standard in weeks, days, and hours.

        Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labour spent on it, the more idle and unskillful the labourer, the more valuable would his commodity be, because more time would be required in its production. The labour, however, that forms the substance of value, is homogeneous human labour, expenditure of one uniform labour-power. The total labour-power of society, which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labour-power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units. Each of these units is the same as any other, so far as it has the character of the average labour-power of society, and takes effect as such; that is, so far as it requires for producing a commodity, no more time than is needed on an average, no more than is socially necessary. The labour-time socially necessary is that required to produce a n article under the normal condition s of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. The introduction of powerlooms into England probably reduced by one-half the labour required to weave a given quantity of yarn into cloth. The handloom weavers, as a matter of fact, continued to require the same time as before; but for all that, the product o f one hour of their labour represented after the change only half an hour's social labour, and consequently fell to one-h al f its former value.

        We see then tha t that which determines the magnitude of the value of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary, or the labour-time socially necessary for its production. Each individual commodity, in this connexion, is to be considered as an average sample of its class, Commodities, therefore, in which equal quantities of labour are embodied, or which can be produced in the same time, have the same value. The value of one commodity is to the value of any other, as the labour-time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other.

""As values, all commodities are only definite masses of congealed
labour-time.""

        The value of a commodity would therefore remain constant, if the labour-time required for its production also remained constant. But the latter changes with every variation in the productiveness of labour. This productiveness is determined by various circumstances, amongst others, by the average amount of skill of the workmen, the state of science, and the degree of its practical application, the social organisation of production, the extent and capabilities of the means of production, and by physical conditions. For example, the same amount of labour in-favourable seasons is embodied in bushels of corn, and in unfavourable, only in four. The same labour extracts from rich mines more metal than from poor mines. Diamonds are of very rare occurrence on the earth's surface, and hence their discovery costs, on an average, a great deal of labour-time. Consequently much labour is represented in a small compass. Jacob doubts whether gold has ever been paid for at its full value. This applies still more to diamonds. According to Eschwege, the total produce of the Brazilian diamond mines for the eighty years, ending in 1823, had not realised the price of one-and-a-half years average produce of the sugar and coffee plantations of the same country, although the diamonds cost much more labour, and therefore represented more value. With richer mines, the same quantity of labour would embody itself in more diamonds, and their value would fall. If we could succeed at a small expenditure of labour, in converting carbon into diamonds, their value might fall below that of bricks. In general, the greater the productiveness of labour, the less is the labour-time required for the production of an article, the less is the amount of labour crystallised in that article, and the less is its value; and vice versa, the less the productiveness of labour, the greater is the labour-time required for the production of an article, and the greater is its value. The value of a commodity, therefore, varies directly as the quantity, and inversely as the productiveness, of the labour incorporated in it.

        A thing ca n be a use-value, without having value. This is the case whenever it’s utility to man is not due to labour. Such are air, virgin soil, natural meadows, &c. A thing can be useful, and the product of human labour, without being a commodity. Whoever directly satisfies his wants with the produce of his own labour, creates, indeed, use-values, but no commodities. In order to produce the latter, he must not only produce' use-values, but use-values for others, social use-values. (And not only for others, without more, The medireval had peasant produced quit-rent-com for his feudal lord and tithe-corn for his parson. But neither the quit-rent-corn nor the tithe-corn became commodities by reason of the fact that they had been produced for others. To become a commodity a product must be transferred to another, whom it will serve as a use-value, by means of an exchange.) Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count as labour, and therefore creates no value.

Section 2. The Two-fold Character of the Labour Embodied in Commodities

        At first sight a commodity presented itself to us as a complex of two things-use-value and exchange-value. Later on, we saw also that labour, too, possesses the same two-fold nature; for, so far as it finds expression in value, it does not possess the same characteristics that belong to it as a creator of use-values. I was the first to point out and to examine critically this two-fold nature of the labour contained in commodities. As this point is the pivot on which a clear comprehension of Political Economy turns, we must go more into detail.

        Let us take two commodities such as a coat and 10 yards of linen, and let the former be double the value of the latter, so that, if 10 yards of linen = W, the coat = 2W.

        The coat is a use-value that satisfies a particular want. Its existence is the result of a special sort of productive activity, the nature of which is determined by its aim, mode of operation, subject, means, and result. The labour, whose utility is thus represented by the value in use of its product, or which manifests itself by making its product a use-value, we call useful labour. In this connexion we consider only its useful effect.

        As the coat and the linen are two qualitatively different usevalues, so also are the two forms of labour that produce them, tailoring and weaving. Were these two objects not qualitatively differrent, not produced respectively by labour of different quality, they could not stand to each other in the relation of commodities. Coats are not exchanged for coats one use-value is not exchanged for another of the same kind.

        To all the different varieties of values in use there correspond as many different kinds of useful labour, classified according to the order, genus, species, and variety to which they belong in the social division of labour. This division of labour is a necessary condition for the production of commodities, but it does not follow, conversely, that the production of commodities is a necessary condition for the division of labour. In the primitive Indian community there is social division of labour, without production of commodities. Or, to take an example nearer home, in every factory the labour is divided according to a system, but this division is not brought about by the operatives mutually exchanging their individual products. Only such products can become commodities with regard to each other, as result from different kinds of labour, each kind being carried on independently and for the account of private individuals.

        To resume, then: In the use-value of each commodity there is contained useful labour, i.e., productive activity of a definite kind and exercised with a definite aim. Use-values cannot confront each other as commodities, unless the useful labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them. In a community, the produce of which in general takes the form of commodities, i.e., in a community of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between the useful forms of labour that are carried on independently by individual producers, each on their own account, develops into a complex system, a social division of labour.

        Anyhow, whether the coat be worn by the tailor or by his customer, in either case it operates as a use-value. Nor is the relation between the coat and the labour that produced it altered by the circumstance that tailoring may have become a special trade, an independent branch of the social division of labour. Wherever the want of clothing forced them to it, the human race made clothes for thousands of years, without a single man becoming a tailor. But coats and linen, like every other element of material wealth that is not the spontaneous produce of Nature, must invariably owe their existence to a special productive activity, exercised with a definite aim, an activity that appropriates particular nature-given materials to particular human wants, So far therefore as labour is a creator of use-value, is useful labour, it is a necessary condition, independent of all forms of society, for the existence of the human race; it is an eternal nature-imposed necessity, without which there can be no material exchanges between man and Nature, and therefore no life.

        The use-values, coat, linen, &c., i.e., the bodies of commodities, are combinations of two elements-matter and labour. If we take away the useful labour expended upon them, a material substratum is always left, which is furnished by Nature without the help of man. The latter can work only as Nature does, that is by changing the form of matter. Nay more, in this work of changing the form he is constantly helped by natural forces. We see, then, that labour is not the only source of material wealth, of use-values produced by labour. As William Petty puts it, labour is its father and the earth its mother.

        Let us, now pass from the commodity considered as a use-value to the value of commodities.

        By our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the linen. But this is a mere quantitative difference, which for the present does not concern us. We bear in mind, however, that if the value of the coat is double that of 10 yds. of linen, 20 yds. of linen must have the same value as one coat. So far as they are values, the coat and the linen are things of a like substance, objective expressions of essentially identical labour. But tailoring and weaving are, qualitatively, different kinds of labour. There are, however, states of society in which one and the same man does tailoring and weaving alternately, in which case these two forms of labour are mere modifications of the labour of the same individual, and no special and fixed functions of different persons; just as the coat which our tailor makes one day, and the trousers which he makes another day, imply only a variation in the labour of one and the same individual. Moreover, we see at a glance that, in our capitalist society, a given portion of human labour is, in accordance with the varying demand, at one time supplied in the form of tailoring, at another in the form of weaving. This change may possibly not take place without friction, but take place it must.

        Productive activity, if we leave out of sight its special form, viz., the useful character of the labour, is nothing but the expenditure of human labour-power. Tailoring and weaving, though qualitatively different productive activities, are each a productive expenditure of human brains, nerves, and muscles, and in this sense are human labour. They are but two different modes of expending human labour-power. Of course, this labour-power, which remains the same under all its modifications, must have attained a certain pitch of development before it can be expended in a multiplicity of modes. But the value of a commodity represents human labour in the abstract, the expenditure of human labour in general. And just as in society, a general or a banker plays a great part, but mere man, on the other hand, a very shabby part,2 so here with human labour. It is the expenditure of simple labour-power, i.e., of the labour-power which, on an average, apart from any special development, exists in the organism of every ordinary individual. Simple average labour, it is true, varies in character in different countries and at different times, but in a particular society it is given. Skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensified, or rather, as multiplied simple labour, a given quantity of skilled being considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour. Experience shows that this reduction is constantly being made. A commodity may be the product of the most skilled labour, but its value, by equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour, represents a definite quantity of the latter labour alone. The different proportions in which different sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as their. Standard, are established by a social process that goes on behind the: backs of the producers, and, consequently, appear to be fixed by custom. For simplicity's sake we shall henceforth account every kind of labour to be unskilled, simple labour; by this we do no more than save ourselves the trouble of making the reduction.

        Just as, therefore, in viewing the coat and linen as values, we abstract from their different use-values, so it is with the labour represented by those values: we disregard the difference between its useful forms, weaving and tailoring. As the use-values, coat and linen, are combinations of special productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the values, coat and linen, are, on the other hand, mere homogeneous congelations of undifferentiated labour, so the labour embodied in these latter values does not count by virtue of its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only as being expenditure of human labour-power. Tailoring and weaving are necessary factors in the creation of the use-values, coat and linen, precisely because these two kinds of labour are of different qualities; but only in so far as abstraction is made from their special qualities, only in so far as both possess the same quality of being human labour, do tailoring and weaving form the substance of the values of the same article.

        Coats and linen, however, are not merely values, but values of definite magnitude, and according to our assumption, the coat is worth twice as much as the ten yards of linen. Whence this difference in their values? It is owing to the fact that the linen contains only half as much labour as the coat, and consequently, that in the production of the latter, labour-power must have been expended during twice the time necessary for the production of the former.

        While, therefore, with reference to use-value, the labour contained in a commodity counts only qualitatively, with reference to value it counts only quantitatively, and must first be reduced to human labour pure and simple. In the former case, it is a question of How and what, in the latter of How much? How long a time? Since the magnitude of the value of a commodity represents only the quantity of labour embodied in it, it follows that all commodities, when taken in certain proportions, must be equal in value.

        If the productive power of all the different sorts of useful labour required for the production of a coat remains unchanged, the sumof the values of the coats produced increases with their number. If one coat represents x days' labour, two coats represent 2 x days' labour, and so on. But assume that the duration of the labour necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled or halved. In the first case, one coat is worth as much as two coats were before; in the second case, two coats are only worth as much as one was before, although in both cases one coat renders the same service as before, and the useful labour embodied in it remains of the same quality. But the quantity of labour spent on its production has altered.

        An increase in the quantity of use-values is an increase of material wealth. With two coats two men can be clothed, with one coat only one man. Nevertheless, an increased quantity of material wealth may correspond to a simultaneous fall in the magnitude of its value. This antagonistic movement has its origin in the two-fold character of labour. Productive power has reference, of course, only to labour of some useful concrete form, the efficacy of any special productive activity during a given time being dependent on its productiveness. Useful labour becomes, therefore, a more or less abundant source of products, in proportion to the rise or fall o f its productiveness. On the other hand, no change in this productiveness affects the labour represented by value. Since productive power is an attribute of the concrete useful forms of labour, of course it can no longer have any bearing on that labour, as soon as we make abstraction from those concrete useful forms. However then productive power may vary, the same labour, exercised during equal periods of time, always yields equal amounts o f value. But it"" will yield, during equal periods of time, different quantities of values in use; more, if the productive power rise, fewer, if it fall. The same change in productive power, which increases the fruitfulness of labour, and, in consequence, the quantity of use-values produced by that labour, will diminish the total value of this increased quality of use-values, provided such change shorten the total labour-time necessary for their production; and vice versa.

        On the one hand all labour is, speaking physioiogically, an expenditure o f human labour-power, and in its character of identical abstract human labour, it creates and forms the value of commodities. On the other hand, all labour is the expenditure of human labour-power in a special form and with a definite aim, and in this, its character of concrete useful labour, it produces use values.

                       Section 3. The Form of Value or Exchange-Value

        Commodities come into the world in the shape of use-values, articles, or goods, such as iron, linen, corn, &c. This is their plain, homely, bodily form. They are, however, commodities, only because they are something two-fold, both objects of utility, and, at the same time, depositories of value. They manifest themselves therefore as commodities, or have the form of commodities, only in so far as they have two forms, a physical or natural form and a value form.

        The reality of the value of commodities differs in this respect from Dame Quickly, that we don't know ""where to have it."" The value of commodities .is the very opposite of the coarse materiality of their substance, not an atom of matter enters into its composition. Turn and examine a single commodity, by itself, as we will, vet in so far as it remains an object of value, it seems impossible to grasp it. If, however, we bear in mind that the value of commodities has a purely social reality, and that they acquire this reality only in so far as they are expressions or embodiments of one identical social substance, viz., human labour, it follows as a matter of course, that value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to commodity. In fact we started from exchange-value, or the exchange relation of commodities, in order to get at the value that lies hidden behind it. We must now return to this –form under which value first appeared to us.

        Every one knows, if he knows nothing else, that commodities have a value-form common to them all, and presenting a marked contrast with the varied bodily forms of their use-values. I mean their money-form. Here, however, a task is set us, the performance of which has never yet even been attempted by bourgeois economy, the task of tracing the genesis of this money-form, of developing the expression of value implied in the value-relation of commodities, from its simplest, almost imperceptible outline, to the dazzling money-form. B y doing this we shall, a t the same time, solves the riddle presented by money.

        The simplest value-relation is evidently that of one commodity to some one other commodity of a different kind. Hence the relation between the values of two commodities supplies us with the simplest expression of the value of a single commodity.

                 A. ELEMENTARY OR ACCIDENTAL FORM OF VALUE

              x commodity A = y commodity B, or
              x commodity A is worth y commodity B.
              20 yards o f linen = 1 coat, or
              20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat.

1. The Two Poles of the Expression of Value: Relative Form and Equivalent Form

        The whole mystery of the form of value lies hidden in this elementary form. Its analysis, therefore, is our real difficulty.

        Here two different kinds of commodities (in our example the linen and the coat), evidently play two different parts. The linen expresses its value in the coat; the coat serves as the material in which that value is expressed. The former plays an active, the latter a passive, part. The value of the linen is represented as relative value, or appears in relative form. The coat officiates as equivalent, or appears in equivalent form.

        The relative form and the equivalent form are two intimately connected, mutually dependent and inseparable elements of. The expression of value; but, at the same time, are mutually exclusive, antagonistic extremes-i.e., poles of the same expression. They are allotted respectively to the two different commodities brought into relation by that expression. It is not possible to express the value of linen in linen. 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen is no expression of value. On the contrary, such an equation merely says that 20 yards of linen are nothing else than 20 yards of linen, a definite quantity of the use-value linen. The value of the linen can therefore be expressed only relatively-i.e., in some other commodity. The relative form of the value of the linen pre-supposes, therefore, the presence of some other commodity-here the coat-under the form of an equivalent. On the other hand, the commodity that figures as the equivalent cannot at the same time assume the relative form. That second commodity is not the one whose value is expressed. Its function is merely to serve as the material in which the value of the first commodity is expressed.


        No doubt, the expression 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth 1 coat, implies the opposite relation: 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen. But, in that case, I must reverse the equation, in order to express the value of the coat relatively; and, so soon as I do that, the linen becomes the equivalent instead of the coat. A single commodity cannot, therefore, simultaneously assume, in the same expression o f value, both forms. The very polarity of these forms makes them mutually exclusive.

        Whether, then, a commodity assumes the relative form, or the opposite equivalent form, depends entirely upon its accidental position in the expression of value-that is, upon whether it is the commodity whose value is being expressed or the commodity in which value is being expressed.

                                      2. The Relative Form of Value

                             a. The Nature and Import of This Form

        In order to discover how the elementary expression of the value of a commodity lies hidden in the value-relation of two commodities, we must, in the first place, consider the latter entirely apart from its quantitative aspect. The usual mode of procedure is generally the reverse, and in the value-relation nothing is seen but the proportion between definite quantities of two different sorts of commodities that are considered equal to each other. It is apt to be forgotten that the magnitudes of different things can be compared quantitatively, only when those magnitudes are expressed in terms of the same unit. It is only as expressions of such a unit that they are of the same denomination, and therefore commensurable.

        Whether 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = 20 coats o r = x coats-that is, whether a given quantity of linen is worth few or in any coats, every such statement implies that the linen and coats, as magnitudes of value, are expressions o f the same unit, things of the same kind. Linen = coat is the basis of the equation.

        But the two commodities, whose identity of quality is thus assumed, do not play the same part. It is only the value of the linen that is expressed, and how? By its reference to the coat as its equivalent, as something that can be exchanged for it. In this relation the coat is the mode of existence of value, is value embodied, for only as such is it the same as the linen. On the other hand, the linen's own value comes to the front, receives independent expression, for it is only as being value that it is comparable with the coat as a thing of equal value, or exchangeable with the coat. To borrow an illustration from chemistry, butyric acid is a different substance from propyl formate. Yet both are made up of the same chemical substances, carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (0), and that, too, in like proportions-namely C4H8O2. If now we equate butyric a cid to propyl formate, then, in the first place, propyl formate would be, in this relation, merely a form of existence of C4H8O2; and in the second place, we should be stating that butyric acid also consists of C4H8O2. Therefore, by thus equating the two substances, expression would be given to their chemical composition, while their different physical forms would be neglected.

        If we say that, as values, commodities are mere congelations of human labour, we reduce them by our analysis, it is true, to the abstraction, value; but we ascribe to this value no form apart from their bodily form. It is otherwise in the value-relation of one commodity to another. Here, the one stands forth in its character of value by reason o f its relation to the other.

        By making the coat the equivalent of the linen, we equate the labour embodied in the former to that in the latter. Now, it is hue that the tailoring, which makes the coat, is concrete labour of a different sort from the weaving which makes the linen. But the act of equating it to the weaving, reduces the tailoring to that which i s really equal in the two kinds of labour, to their common character of human labour. In this roundabout way, then, the fact is expressed, that weaving also, in so far as it weaves value, has nothing to distinguish it from tailoring, and, consequently, is 'abstract human labour. It is the expression of equivalence between different sorts of commodities that alone brings into relief the specific character of value-creating labour, and this it does by actually reducing the different varieties of labour embodied in the different kinds of commodities to their common quality of human labour in the abstract.

        There is, however, something else required beyond the expression of the specific character of the labour of which the value of the linen consists. Human labour-power in motion, or human labour, creates value, but is not itself value. It becomes value only in its congealed state, when embodied in the form of some object. In order to express the value of the linen as a congelation of human labour, that value must be expressed as having objective existence, as being a something materially different from the linen itself, and yet a something common to the linen and all other commodities. The problem is already solved.

        When occupying the position of equivalent in the equation of value, the coat ranks qualitatively as the equal of the linen, as something of the same kind, because it is value. In this position it is a thing in which we see nothing but value, or whose palpable bodily form represents value. Yet the coat itself, the body of the commodity, coat, is a mere use-value. A coat as such no more tells us it is value, than does the first piece of linen we take hold of. This shows that when placed in value-relation to the linen, t h e coat signifies more than when out of that relation, jus t as many a man strutting about in a gorgeous uniform counts for more than when in mufti.

        In the production of the coat, human labour-power, in the shape of tailoring, must have been actually expended. Human labour is therefore accumulated in it. In this aspect the coat is a depository of value, but though worn to a thread, it does not let this fact show through. And as equivalent of the linen in the value equation, it exists under this aspect alone, counts therefore as embodied value, as a body that is value. A, for instance, cannot be ""your majesty"" to B, unless at the same time majesty in B's eyes assumes the bodily form of A, and, what is more, with every new father of the people, changes its features, hair, and many other things besides.

        Hence, in the value equation, in which the coat is the equivalent of the linen, the coat officiates as the form of value. The value of the commodity linen is expressed by the bodily form of the commodity coat, the value of one by the use-value of the other. As a use-value, the linen is something palpably different from the coat; as value, it is the same as the coat, and now has the appearance of a coat. Thus the linen acquires a value-form different from its physical form. The fact that it is value is made manifest by its equality with the coat, just as the sheep's nature of a Christian is shown in his resemblance to the Lamb of God.

        We see, then, all that our analysis o f the value o f commodities has already told us, is told us by the linen itself, so soon as it comes into communication with another commodity, the coat. Only it betrays its thoughts in that language with which alone it is familiar, the language of commodities. In order to tell us that its own value is created by labour in its abstract character of human labour, it says that the coat, in so far as it is worth as much as the linen, and therefore is value, consists of the same labour as the linen. In order to inform us that its sublime reality as value is not the same as its buckram body, it says that value has the appearance of a coat, and consequently that so far as the linen is value, it and the coat are as like as two peas. We may here remark, that the language of commodities has, besides Hebrew, many other more or less correct dialects. The German ""Wertsein,"" to be worth, for instance, expresses in a less striking manner than the Romance verbs ""valere,"" ""valer,"" ""valoir,"" that the equating of commodity B to commodity A, is commodity A's own mode of expressing its value. Paris vaut bien une messe.

        By means, therefore, of the value-relation expressed in our equation, the bodily form of commodity B becomes the value-form of commodity A, or the body of commodity B acts as a mirror to the value of commodity A. By putting itself in relation with commodity B, as value in propria persona, as the matter of which human labour is made up, the commodity A converts the value in use, B, into the substance in which to express its, A's, own value. The value of A, thus expressed in the use-value of B, has taken the form of relative value.

                      a. b. Quantitative Determination of Relative Value

        Every commodity, whose value it is intended to express, is a useful object of given quantity, as 15 bushels of corn, or 100 lbs. of coffee. And a given quantity of any commodity contains a definite quantity of human labour. The value-form must therefore not only express value generally, but also value in definite quantity. Therefore, in the value-relation of commodity A to commodity B, of the linen to the coat, not only is the latter, as value in general, made the equal in quality of the linen, but a definite quantity of coat (1 coat) is made the equivalent of a definite quantity (20 yards) of linen.

        The equation, 20 yards of linen=l coat, or 20 yards of linen are worth one coat, implies that the same quantity of value-substance (congealed labour) is embodied in both; that the two commodities have each cost the same a mount of labour of the same quantity of labour-time. But the labour-time necessary for the production of 20 yards of linen or 1 coat varies with every change in the productiveness of weaving or tailoring. We have now to consider the influence of such changes on the quantitative aspect of the relative expression of value.

        I. Let the value of the linen vary, that of the coat remaining constant. If, say in consequence of the exhaustion of flax-growing soil, the labour-time necessary for the production of the linen be doubled, the value of the linen will also be doubled. Instead of the equation, 20 yards of linen= 1 coat, we should have 20 yards of linen=2 coats, since 1 coat would now contain only half the labour-time embodied in 20 yards of linen. If, on the other hand, in consequence, say, of improved looms, this labour-time be reduced by one-half, the value of the linen would fall by one-half. Consequently, we should have 20 yards of linen=Yz coat. The relative value of commodity A, i.e., its value expressed in commodity B, rises and falls directly as the value of A, the value of B being supposed constant.

        II. Let the value of the linen remain constant, while the value of the coat varies. If, under these circumstances, in consequence, for instance, of a poor crop of wool, the labour-time necessary for the production of a coat becomes doubled, we have instead of 20 yards of linen= 1 coat, 20 yards o f linen= Yz coat. I f, on the other hand, the value o f the coat sinks by one-half, then 20 yards of linen=2 coats. Hence, if the value of commodity a remains constant, its relative value expressed in commodity B rises and falls inversely as the value of B.

        If we compare the different cases in I. and II, we see that the same change of magnitude in relative value may arise from totally opposite causes. Thus, the equation, 20 yards of linen=l coat, becomes 20 yards of linen= 2 coats, either, because the value of the linen has doubled, or because the value of the coat has fallen by one-half; and it becomes 20 yards of linen=Y2 coat, either, because the value of the linen has fallen by one-half, or because the value of the coat has doubled.

        III. Let the quantities of labour-time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat vary simultaneously in the same direction and in the same proportion. In this case 20 yards of linen continue equal to 1 coat, however much their values may have altered. Their change of value is seen as soon as they are compared with a third commodity, whose value has remained constant. If the values o f all commodities rose or fell simultaneously, and in the same proportion, their relative values would remain unaltered. Their real change of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of commodities produced in a given time.

        IV. The labour-time respectively necessary for the production of the linen and the coat, and therefore the value o f these commodities may simultaneously vary in the same direction, but a t unequal rates, or in opposite directions, or in other ways. The effect of all these possible different variations, on the relative value of a commodity, may be deduced from the results of I, II, and III. Thus real changes in the magnitude of value are neither unequivocally nor exhaustively reflected in their relative expression, that is, in the equation expressing the magnitude o f relative value. The relative value of a commodity may vary, although its value remains constant. Its relative value may remain constant, although its value varies; and finally, simultaneous variations in the magnitude of value and in that of its relative expression by no means necessarily correspond in amount.

            Section 4. The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret Thereof

        A commodity appears, at first sight, a very trivial thing, and easily understood. Its analysis shows that it is, in reality, a very queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties. So far as it is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it, whether we consider it from the point of view that by its properties it is capable of satisfying human wants, or from the point that those properties are the product of human labour. It is as clear as noon-day that man, by his industry, changes the forms of the materials furnished by Nature, in such a way as to make them useful to him. The form of wood, for instance, is altered, by making a table out of it. Yet, for all that, the table continues to be that common, every-day thing, wood. But, as soon as it steps forth as a commodity, it is changed into something transcendent. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than ""table-turning"" ever was.

        The mystical character of commodities does not originate, therefore, in their use-value. Just as little does it proceed from the nature of the determining factors of value, For, in the first place, however varied the useful kinds of labour, or productive activities, may be, it is a physiological fact, that they are functions o f the human organism, and that each such function, whatever may be its nature or form, is essentially the expenditure of human brain, nerves, muscles, &c. Secondly, with regard to that which forms the groundwork for the quantitative determination of value, namely, the duration of that expenditure, or the quantity of labour, it is quite clear that there is a palpable difference between its quantity and quality. In all states of society, the labour-time that it costs to produce the means of subsistence, must necessarily b e an object of interest to mankind, though not of equal interest in different stages of development. And lastly, from the moment that men in any way work for one another, their labour assumes a social form.

        Whence, then, arises the enigmatical character of the product of labour, as soon as it assumes the form of commodities? Clearly from this form itself. The equality of all sorts of human labour is expressed objectively by their products all being equally values; the measure of the expenditure of labour-power by the duration o f that expenditure, takes the form o f the quantity of value o f the products of labour; and finally, the mutual relations of the producers with in which the social character of their labour affirms itself, take the form of a social relation between the products.

        A commodity is therefore a mysterious thing, simply because in it the social character of men's labour appears to t h e m as an objective character stamped upon the product of that labour; because the relation of the producers to the sum total of their own labour is presented to them as a social relation, existing not between themselves, but between the products of their labour. This is the reason why the products of labour become commodities, social things whose qualities are at the same time perceptible and imperceptible by the senses. In the same way the light from an object is perceived by us not as the subjective excitation of our optic nerve, but as the objective form of something outside the eye itself. But, in the act of seeing, there is at all events, an actual passage of light from one thing to another, from the external object to the eye. There is a physical relation between physical things. But it is different with commodities. There, the existence of the things qua commodities, and the value-relation between the products of labour which stamps them as commodities, has absolutely no connexion with their physical properties and with the material relations arising therefore. There it is a definite social relation between men that assumes, in their eyes, the fantastic form of a relation between things. In order, therefore, to find an analogy, we must have recourse to the mist-enveloped regions of the religious world. In that world the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race. So it is in the world of commodities with the products of men's hands. This I call the Fetishism which attaches itself to the products of labour, as soon as they are produced as commodities, and which is therefore inseparable from the production of commodities.

        This Fetishism of commodities has its origin, as the foregoing analysis has already shown, in the peculiar social character of the labour that produces them.

        As a general rule, articles of utility become commodities, only because they are products of the labour of private individuals or groups of individuals who carry on their work independently of each other. The sum total of the labour of all these private individuals forms the aggregate labour of society. Since the producers do not come into social contact with each other until they exchange their products, the specific social character of each producer's labour does not show itself except in the act of exchange. I n other words, the labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society, only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly between the products, and indirectly, through them, between the producers. To the latter, therefore, the relations connecting the labour of one individual with that of the rest appear, not as direct social relations between individuals at work, but as what they really are, material relations between persons and social relations between things. It is only by being exchanged that the products of labour acquire, as values, one uniform social status, distinct from their varied forms of existence as objects of utility. This division of a product into a useful thing and a value becomes practically important, only when exchange has acquired such an extension that useful articles are produced for the purpose of being exchanged, and their character as values has therefore to be taken into account, before hand, during production. From this moment the labour of the individual producer acquires socially a two-fold character. On the one hand, it must, as a definite useful kind of labour, satisfy a definite social want, and thus hold its p lace as part and parcel of the collective labour of all, as a branch of a social division of labour that has sprung up spontaneously. On the other hand, it can satisfy the manifold wants of the individual producer himself, only in so far as the mutual exchangeability of all kinds of useful private labour is an established social fact, and therefore the private useful labour of each producer ranks on equality with that of all others. The equalisation of the most different kinds of labour can be the result only of an abstraction from their inequalities, or of reducing them to their common denominator, viz., and expenditure of human labour-power or human labour in the abstract. The two-fold social character of the labour of the individual appears to him, when reflected in his brain, only under those forms which are impressed upon that labour in every-day practice by the exchange of products. In this way, the character that his own labour possesses of being socially useful takes the form of the condition, that the product must be not only useful, but useful for others, and the social character that his particular labour has o f being the equal of an other particular kinds of labour, takes the form that an the physically different articles that are the products of labour, have one common quality, viz., that of having value.

        Hence, when we bring the products of our labour into relation with each other as values, it is not because we see in these articles the material receptacles of homogeneous human labour. Quite the contrary: whenever, by an exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labour, the different kinds of labour expended upon them. We are not aware of this, nevertheless we do it. Value, therefore, does not stalk about with a label describing what it is. It is value rather, that converts every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later on, we try to decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of our own social products; for to stamp an object of utility as a value, is just as much a social product as language. The recent scientific discovery, that the products of labour, so far as they are values, are but material expressions of the human labour spent in their production, marks, indeed, an epoch in the history o f the development of the human race, but, by no means, dissipates the mist through which the social character of labour appears to us to be an objective character of the products themselves. The fact, that in the particular form of production with which we are dealing, viz., the production of commodities, the specific social character of private labour carried on independently, consists in the equality of every kind of that labour, by virtue of its being human labour, which character, therefore, assumes in the product the form of value-this fact appears to the producers, notwithstanding the discovery above referred to, to be just as real and final, as the fact, that, after the discovery by science of the component gases of air, the atmosphere itself remainerl unaltered.

        What, first of all, practically concerns producers when they make an exchange, is the question, how much of some other product they get for their own? in what proportions the products are exchangeable? When these proportions have, b y custom, attained a certain stability, they appear to result from the nature of the products, so that, for instance, one ton of iron and two ounces of gold appear as naturally to be of equal value as a pound of gold and a pound of iron in spite of their different physical and chemical qualities appear to be of equal weight. The character of having value, when once impressed upon products, obtains fixity only by reason of their acting and re-acting upon each other as quantities of value. These quantities vary continually, independently of the will, foresight and action of the producers. To them, their own social action takes the form of the action of objects, which rule the producers instead of being ruled by the. It requires a fully developed production of commodities before, from accumulated experience alone, the scientific conviction springs up, that all the different kinds of private labour, which are carried on independently of each other, and yet as spontaneously developed branches of the social division of labour, are continually being reduced to the quantitative proportions in which society requires them, And why? Because, in the midst of all the accidental and ever fluctuating exchange-relations between the products, the labour-time socially necessary for their production forcibly asserts itself like an over-riding law of Nature. The law of gravity thus asserts itself when a house falls about our ears. The determination of the magnitude of value by labour-time is therefore a secret, hidden under the apparent fluctuations in the relative values of commodities. Its discovery, while removing all appearance of mere accidentality from the determination of the magnitude of the values of products, yet in no way alters the mode in which that determination takes place. Man's reflections on the forms of social life, and consequently, also, his scientific analysis of those forms, take a course directly opposite to that of their actual historical development. He begins, post festum, with the results of the process of development ready to hand before him . The characters that stamp products as commodities, and whose establishment is a necessary preliminary to the circulation of commodities, have already acquired the stability of natural, self-understood forms of social life, before man seeks to decipher, not their historical character, for in his eyes they are immutable, but their meaning. Consequently it was the analysis of the prices of commodities that alone led to the determination of the magnitude of value, and it was the common expression of all commodities in money that alone led to the establishment of their characters as values. It is, however, just this ultimate money-form of the world of commodities that actually conceals, instead of disclosing, the social character of private labour, and the social relations between the individual producers. When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen, because it is the universal incarnation of abstract human labour, the absurdity of the statement is self-evident. Nevertheless, when the producers of coats and boots compare those articles with linen, or, what is the same thing, with gold or silver, as the universal equivalent, they express the relation between their own private labour and the collective labour of society in the same absurd form.

        The categories of bourgeois economy consist of such like forms. They are forms o f thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite, historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labour as long as they take the form of commodities vanishes therefore, as soon as we come to other forms of production.

        Since Robinson Crusoe's experiences are a favorite theme with political economists, let us take a look at him on his island. Moderate though he be, yet some few wants he h a s to satisfy, and must therefore do a little useful work of various sorts, such as making tools and furniture, taming goats, fishing and hunting . Of his prayers and the like we take no account, since they are a source of pleasure to him, and he looks upon them as so much recreation. In spite of the variety of his work, he knows that his labour, whatever its form, is but the activity of one and the same Robinson, and consequently, that it consists of nothing but different modes of human labour. Necessity itself compels him to apportion his time accurately between his different kinds of work. Whether one kind occupies a greater space in his general activity than another, depends on the difficulties, greater or less as the case may be, to be overcome in attaining the useful effect aimed at. This our friend Robinson soon learns b y experience, and having rescued a watch, ledger, and pen and ink from the wreck, commences, like a trueborn Briton, to keep a set of books. His stock-book contains a list of the objects of utility that belong to him, of the operations necessary for their production; and lastly, of the labour-time that definite quantities of those objects have, on an average, cost him. All the relations between Robinson and the objects that form this wealth of his own creation, are here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without exertion, even to Mr. Sedley Taylor. And yet those relations contain that is essential to the determination of value.

        Let us now transport ourselves from Robinson's island bathed in light to the European middle ages shrouded in darkness. Here, instead of the independent man, we find everyone dependent, serfs and lords, vassals and suzerains, laymen and clergy. Personal dependence here characterises the social relations of production just as much as it does the other spheres of life organised on the basis of that production, But for the very reason that personal dependence forms the ground-work of society, there i s n o necessity for labour and its products to assume a fantastic form different from their reality. They take the shape, in the transactions of society, of services in kind and payments in kind. Here the particular and natural form of labour, and not, as in a society based on production of commodities, its general abstract form is the immediate social form of labour. Compulsory labour is just as properly measured by time, as commodity-producing labour, but every serf knows that what he expends in the service of his lord is a definite quantity of his own personal labour-power. The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing. No matter, then, what we may think of the parts played by the different classes of people themselves in this society, the social relations between individuals in the performance of their labour, appear at all events as their own mutual personal relations, and are not disguised under the shape of social relations between the products of labour.

        For an example of labour in common or directly associated labour, we have no occasion to go back to that spontaneously developed form which we find on the threshold of the history of all civilized races. We have one close at hand in the patriarchal industries of a peasant family that produces corn, cattle, yarn, linen, and clothing for home use. These different articles are, as regards the family, so many products of its labour, but as between themselves, they are not commodities. The different kinds of labour, such as tillage, cattle tending, spinning, weaving and making clothes, which result in the various products, are in themselves, and such as they are, direct social functions, because functions of the family, which, just as much a s a society based on the production of commodities, possesses a spontaneously developed system of division of labour. The distribution of the work within the family and the regulation of the labour-time of the several members, depend as well upon differences of age and sex as upon natural conditions varying with the seasons. The labour-power of each individual, by its very nature, operates in this case merely as a definite portion of the whole labour-power of the family, and therefore, the measure of the expenditure of individual labour-power by its duration, appears here by its very nature as a social character of their labour.

        Let us now picture to ourselves, by way of change, a community of free individuals, carrying on their work with the means of production in common, in which the labour-power of all the different individuals is consciously applied as the combined labour-power of the community. All the characteristics of Robinson's labour are here repeated, but with this difference, that they are social, instead of individual. Everything produced by him was exclusively the result of his own personal labour, and therefore simply an object of use for himself. The total product of our community is a social product. One portion serves as fresh means of production and remains social. But another portion is consumed by the members as means of subsistence. A distribution of this portion amongst them is consequently necessary. The mode of this distribution will vary with the productive organisation of the community, and the degree of historical development attained by the producers. We will assume, but merely for the sake of a parallel with the production of commodities, that the share of each individual producer in the means of subsistence is determined by his labour-time. Labour-time would, in that case, play a double part. Its apportionment in accordance with a definite social plan maintains the proper proportion between the different kinds of work to be done and the various wants of the community. On the other hand, it also serves as a measure of the portion of the common labour borne by each individual, and of his share in the part of the total product destined for -individual consumption. The social relations of the individual producers, with regard both to their labour and to its products, are in this case perfectly simple and intelligible, and that with regard not only to production but also to distribution.

        The religious world is but the reflex of the real world. And for a society based upon the production of commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social relations with one another by treating their products as commodities and values, whereby they reduce their individual private labour to the standard of homogeneous human labour-for such a society, Christianity with its cultus of abstract man, more especially in its bourgeois developments, Protestantism, Deism, &c., is the most fitting form of religion. In the ancient Asiatic and other ancient modes of production, we find that the conversion of products into commodities, and therefore the conversion of men into producers of commodities, holds a subordinate place, which, however, increases in importance as the primitive communities approach nearer and nearer to their dissolution. Trading nations, properly so called, exist in the • ancient world only in its interstices, like the gods of Epicurus in the Intermundia, or like Jews in the pores of Polish society. Those ancient social organisms of production are, as compared with bourgeois society, extremely simple and transparent. But they are founded either on the immature development of man individually, who has not yet severed the umbilical cord that unites him with his fellowmen in a primitive tribal community, or upon direct relations of subjection. They can arise and exist only when the development of the productive power of labour has not risen beyond a low stage, and then, therefore, the social relations within the sphere of material life, between man and man, and between man and Nature, are correspondingly narrow. This narrowness is reflected in the ancient worship of Nature, and in the other elements of the popular religions. The religious reflex of the real world can, in any case, only then finally vanish, when the practical relations of every-day life offer to man none but perfectly intelligible and reasonable relations with regard to his fellowmen and to Nature.

        The life-process of society, which is based on the process of material production, does not strip off its mystical veil until it is treated as production by freely associated men, and is consciously regulated by them in accordance with a settled plan . This, however, demands for society a certain material ground-work or set of conditions of existence which in their turn are the spontaneous product of a long and painful process of development.

        Political Economy has indeed analysed, however incompletely, value and its magnitude, and has discovered what lies beneath these forms. But it has never once asked the question why labour is represented by the value of its product and labour-time by the magnitude of that value. These formulae, which bear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they belong to a state of society, in which the process of production has the mastery over man, instead of being controlled by him, such formulae appear to the bourgeois intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by Nature as productive labour itself. Hence forms of social production that preceded the bourgeois form are treated by the bourgeoisie in much the same way as the Fathers of the Church treated pre-Christian religions.

        To what extent some economists are misled by the Fetishism inherent in commodities, or by the objective appearance of the social characteristics of labour, are shown, amongst other ways, by the dull and tedious quarrel over the part played by Nature in the formation of exchange-value. Since exchange-value is a definite social manner of expressing the amount of labour bestowed upon object, Nature has no more to do with it, than it has in fixing the course of exchange.

        The mode of production in which the product takes the form of a commodity, or is produced directly for exchange, is the most general and most embryonic form of bourgeois product ion. It therefore makes its appearance at an early date in history, though not in the same predominating and characteristic manner as now-a-days. Hence its Fetish character is comparatively easy to be seen through. But when we come to more concrete forms, even this appearance o f simplicity vanishes. Whence arose the illusions of the monetary system? To it gold and silver, when serving as money, did not represent a social relation between producers but were natural objects with strange social properties. And modern economy, which looks down with such disdain on the monetary system, does not its superstition come out as clear as noon-day, whenever it treats of capital? How long is it since economy discarded the physiocratic illusion that rents grow out of the soil and not out of society?

        But not to anticipate, we will content ourselves with yet another example relating to the commodity-form. Could commodities themselves speak, they would say: Our use-value may be a thing that interests men. It is no part of us as objects. What, however, does belong to us as objects, is our value. Our natural intercourse as commodities proves it. In the eyes of each other we are nothing but exchange-values. Now listen how those commodities speak through the mouth of the economist. ""Value""- (i. e., exchange-value) ""is a property of things, riches""- (i.e., use-value ) "" of man . Value, in this sense, necessarily implies exchanges, riches do not."" "" Riches"" ( use-value ) ""are the attribute of men, value is the attribute of commodities. A man or a community is rich, a pearl or a diamond is valuable . . . . A pearl or a diamond is valuable"" as a pearl or diamond, So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange-value either in a pearl or a diamond. The economic discoverers of this chemical element, who by-the-by lay special claim to critical acumen, find however that the use-value o f objects belongs to them independently of their material properties, while their value, on the other hand, forms a part of them as objects. What confirms them in this view is the peculiar circumstance that the use-value of objects is realised without exchange, by means of a direct relation between the objects and man, while, on the other hand, their value is realized only by exchange, that is, by means of a social process. Who fails here to call to mind our good friend, Dogberry, who informs neighbour Seacoal, that, ""To be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune; but reading and writing comes by Nature.""

                        Part II. The Transformation of Money into Capital

                CHAPTER IV. THE GENERAL FORMULA FOR CAPITAL

        The circulation of commodities is the starting-point of capital. The production of commodities, their circulation, and that more developed form of their circulation called commerce, these form the historical ground-work from which it rises. The modern history of capital dates from the creation in the 16th century of a world embracing commerce and a world-embracing market.

        If we abstract from the material substance of the circulation of commodities, that is, from the exchange of the various use-values, and consider only the economic forms produced by this process of circulation, we find its final result to be money: this final product of the circulation of commodities is the first form in which capital appears.

        As a matter of history, capital, as opposed to landed property invariably takes the form at first of money; it appears as moneyed wealth, as the capital of the merchant and of the usurer. But we have no need to refer to the origin of capital in order to discover that the first form of appearance of capital is money. We can see it daily under our very eyes. All new capital, to commence with, comes on the stage, that is, on the market, whether of commodities, labour, or money, even in our days, in the shape of money that by a definite process has to be transformed into capital.

        The first distinction we notice between money that is money only, and money that is capital, is nothing more than a difference in their form of circulation.

        The simplest form of the circulation of commodities is C-M-C, the transformation of commodities into money, and the change of the money back again into commodities; or selling in order to buy. But alongside of this form we find another specifically different form: M-C-M, the transformation of money into commodities, and the change of commodities back again into money; or buying in order to sell. Money that circulates in the latter manner is thereby transformed into, becomes capital, and is already potentially capital.

        Now let us examine the circuit M-C-M a little closer. It consists, like the other, of two antithetical phases. In the first phase, M-C, or the purchase, the money is changed into a commodity. In the second phase, C-M, o r the sale, the commodity is changed back again into money. The combination of these two phases constitutes the single movement whereby money is exchanged for a commodity, and the same commodity is again exchanged for money; whereby a commodity is bought in order to be sold, or, neglecting the distinction in form between buying and selling, whereby a commodity is bought with a commodity. The result, in which the phases of the process vanish, is the exchange of money for money, M-M. If I purchase 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £ 100, and resell the 2,000 lbs. of cotton for £ 110, I have, in fact, exchanged £ 100 for £ 110, money for money.

        Now it is evident that the circuit M-C-M would be absurd and without meaning if the intention were to ' exchange by this means two equal sums of money, £ 100 for £ 100. The miser's plan would be far simpler and surer; he sticks to his £ 100 instead of exposing it to the dangers of circulation. And yet, whether the merchant who has paid £ 100 for his cotton sells it for £ 110, or lets it go for £ 100, or even £50, his money has, at all events, gone through a characteristic and original movement, quite different in kind from that which it goes through in the hands of the peasant who sells corn, and with the money thus set free buys clothes. We have therefore to examine first the distinguishing characteristics o f t h e forms of the circuits M-C-M and C-M-C, and in doing this the real difference that underlies the mere difference of form will reveal itself.

        Let us see, in the first place, what the two forms have in common.

        Both circuits are resolvable into the same two antithetical phases, C-M, a sale, and M-C, a purchase. In each of these phases the same material elements-a commodity, and money, and the same economic dramatis personal, a buyer and a seller-confront one another. Each circuit is the unity of the same two antithetical phases, and in each case this unity is brought about by the intervention of three contracting parties, of whom one only sells, another only buys, while the third both buys and sells.

        What, however, first and foremost distinguishes the circuit C-M-C from the circuit M-C-M, is the inverted order of succession of the two phases. The simple circulation of commodities begins with a sale and ends with a purchase, while the circulation of money as capital begins with a purchase and ends with a sale. In the one case both the starting-point and the goal are commodities, in the other they are money. In the first form the movement is brought about by the intervention of money, in the second by that of a commodity.

        In the circulation C-M-C, the money is in the end converted into a commodity that serves as a use-value; it is spent once for all. In the inverted form, M-C-M, on the contrary, the buyer lays out money in order that, as a seller, he may recover money. By the purchase of his commodity he throws money into circulation, in order to withdraw it again by the sale of the same commodity. He lets the money go, but only with the sly intention of getting it back again. The money, therefore, is not s pent, it is merely advanced.

        In the circuit C-M-C, the same piece of money changes its place twice. The seller gets it from the buyer and pays it away to another seller. The complete circulation, which begins with the receipt, concludes with the payment, of money for commodities. It is the very contrary in the circuit M-C-M. Here it is not the piece of money that changes its place twice, but the commodity. The buyer takes it from the hands of the seller and passes it into the hands of another buyer. Just as in the simple circulation of commodities the double change of place of the same piece of money effects its passage from one hand into another, so here the double change of place of the same commodity brings about the reflux of the money to its point of departure.

        Such reflux is not dependent on the commodity being sold for more than was paid for it. This circumstance influences only the amount of the money that comes back. The reflux itself takes place, so soon as the purchased commodity is resold, in other words, so soon as the circuit M-C-M is completed. We have here, therefore, a palpable difference between the circulation of money as capital, and its circulation as mere money.

        The circuit C-M-C comes completely to an end, as soon as the money brought in by the sale of one commodity is abstracted again by the purchase of another.

        If, nevertheless, there follows a reflux of money to its starting point, this can only happen through a renewal or repetition of the operation. If I sell a quarter of corn of £3, and with this £3 buy clothes, the money, so far as I am concerned, is spent and done with. It belongs to the clothes merchant. If I now sell a second quarter of corn, money indeed flows back to me, not however as a, sequel to the first transaction, but in consequence o f its repetition. The money again leaves me, as soon as I complete this second transaction by a fresh purchase. Therefore, in the circuit C-M-C, the expenditure of money h a s nothing to do with its reflux. On the other hand, in M-C-M, the reflux of the money is conditioned by the very mode of its expenditure. Without this reflux, the operation fails, or the process is interrupted and incomplete, owing to the absence of its complementary and final phase, the sale.

        The circuit C-M-C starts with one commodity, and finishes with another, which falls out of circulation and into consumption. Consumption, this satisfaction of wants, in one word, use-value, is its end and aim. The circuit M-C-M, on the contrary, commences with money and ends with money. Its leading motive, and the goal that attracts it, is therefore mere exchange-value.

        In the simple circulation of commodities, the two extremes of the cirr.uit have the same economic form. They are both commodities, and commodities of equal value. But they are also use-values differing in their qualities, as, for example, corn and clothes. The exchange of products, of the different materials in which the labour of society is embodied, forms here the basis of the movement. It is otherwise in the circulation M-C M, which at first sight appears purposeless, because tautological. Both extremes have the same economic form. They are both money, and therefore are not qualitatively different use-values; for money is but the converted form of commodities, in which their particular use-values vanish. To exchange £ 100 for cotton, and then this same cotton again for £ 110, is merely a roundabout way of exchanging money for money, the same for the same, and appears to be an operation just as purposeless as it is absurd. One sum of money is distinguishable from another only by its amount. The character and tendency of the process M-C-M, is therefore not due to any qualitative difference between its extremes, both being money, but solely to their quantitative difference. More money is withdrawn from circulation at the finish than was thrown into it at the start. The cotton that was bought for £ 100 is perhaps resold for £ 100 + £ 10 or £ 110. The exact form of this process is therefore M-C-M, where M = M + 6M = the original sum advanced, plus an increment. This increment or excess over the original value I call ""surplus-value."" The value originally advanced, therefore, not only remains intact while in circulation, but adds to itself a surplus-value or expands itself. It is this movement that converts it into capital.

        Of course, it is also possible, that in C-M-C, the two extremes C-C, say corn and clothes, may represent different quantities of value. The farmer may sell his corn above its value, or may buy the clothes at less than their value. He may, on the other hand, ""be done"" by the clothes merchant. Yet, in the form of circulation now under consideration, such differences in value are purely accidental. The fact that the corn and the clothes are equivalents does not deprive the process of all meaning, as it does in M-C-M. The equivalence of their values is rather a necessary condition to its normal course.

        The repetition or renewal of the act of selling in order to buy is kept within bounds by the very object it aims at, namely, consumption o r the satisfaction of definite wants, an aim that lays altogether outside the sphere of circulation. But when we buy in order to sell, we, on the contrary, begin and end with the same thing, money, and exchange-value; and thereby the movement becomes interminable. No doubt, M becomes M+ ∆M, £ 100 become £ 110. But when viewed in their qualitative aspect alone, £ 110 are the same as £ 100, namely money; and considered quantitatively, £ 110 is, like £ 100, a sum of definite and limited value. If now, the £ 110 be spent as money, they cease to play their part. They are no longer capital. Withdrawn from circulation, they become petrified into a + hoard, and though they remained in that state till doomsday, not a single farthing would accrue to them. If, then, the expansion of value is once aimed at, there is just the same inducement to augment the value of the £ 110 as that of the £ 1 00; for both are but limited expressions for exchange-value, and therefore both have the same vocation to approach, by quantitative •increase, as near as possible to absolute wealth . Momentarily, indeed, the value originally advanced, the £ 100, is distinguishable from the surplus-value of £ 10 that is annexed to it during circulation; but the distinction vanishes immediately. At the end of the process, we do not receive with one hand the original £ 100, and with the other, the surplus-value of £ 10. We simply get a value of £ 110, which is in exactly the same condition and fitness for commencing the expanding process, as the original £ 1 00 was. Money ends the movement only to begin it again. Therefore, the final result of every separate circuit in which a purchase and consequent sale are completed, forms of itself the starting-point of a new circuit. The simple circulation of commodities- selling in order to buy-is a means of carrying out a purpose unconnected with circulation, namely, the appropriation of use values, the satisfaction of wants . The circulation of money as capital is, on the contrary, an end in itself, for the expansion of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement. The circulation of capital has therefore no limits.

        As the conscious representative of this movement, the possessor of money becomes a capitalist. His person, or rather his pocket, is the point from which the money starts and to which it returns. The expansion of value, which is the objective basis or main-spring of the circulation M-C-M, becomes his subjective aim, and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations, that he functions as a capitalist, that is, as capital personified and endowed with consciousness and a will. Use-values must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the capitalist; neither must the profit on any single transaction. The restless never-ending process of profit-making alone is what he aims at. This boundless greed after riches, this passionate chase after exchange-value, is common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is merely a capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser. The never-ending augmentation of exchange-value, which the miser strives after, by seeking to save his money from circulation, is attained by the more acute capitalist, by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation.

        The independent form, i.e., the money-form, which the value of commodities assumes in the case of simple circulation, serves only one purpose, namely, their exchange, and vanishes in the final result of the movement. On the other hand, in the circulation M-C-M, both the money and the commodity represent only different modes of existence of value itself, the money its general mode, and the commodity it’s particular, or, so to say, disguised mode. It is constantly changing from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost, and thus assumes an automatically active character. If now we take in turn each of the two different forms which self-expanding value successively assumes in the course of its life, we then arrive a t these two propositions: Capital is money: Capital is commodities. In truth, however, value is here the active factor in a process, in which, while constantly assuming the form in turn of money and commodities, it at the same time changes in magnitude, differentiates itself by throwing off surplus-value from itself; the original value, in other words, expands spontaneously. For the movement, in the course of which it adds surplus-value is its own movement, its expansion, therefore, is automatic expansion. Because it is value, it has acquired the occult quality of being able to add value to it. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.

        Value, therefore, being the active factor in such a process, and assuming at one time the form o f money, at another that of commodities, but through all these changes preserving itself and expanding, it requires some independent form, by means of which its identity may at any time be established. And this form it possesses only in the shape of money. It is under the form of money that value begins and ends, and begins again, every act of its own spontaneous generation. It began by being £ 100 it is now £ 110, and so on. But the money itself is only one of the two forms of value. Unless it takes the form of some commodity, it does not become capital. There is here no antagonism, as in the case of hoarding, between the money and commodities. The capitalist knows that all commodities, however scurvy they may look, or however badly they may smell, are in faith and in truth money, inwardly circumcised Jews, and what is more, a wonderful means whereby out o f money to make more money.

        In simple circulation, C-M-C, the value of commodities attained at the most a form independent of their use-values, i.e., the form of money; but that same value now in the circulation M-C-M, or the circulation of capital, suddenly presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own, passing through a life-process of its own, in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off in turn. Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value; as the father differentiates himself from himself qua the son, yet both are one and of one age: for only by the surplus-value of £ 10 does the £ 100 originally advanced become capital, and so soon as this takes place, so soon as the son, and by the son, the father, is begotten, so soon does their difference vanish, and they again become one, £ 110.

        Value therefore now becomes value in process, money in process; and, as such, capital. It comes out of circulation, enters into it again, preserves and multiplies itself within its circuit, comes back out of it with expanded bulk, and begins the same round ever afresh  M-M, money which begets money, such is the description of Capital from the mouths of its first interpreters, the Mercantilists.

        Buying in order to sell, or, more accurately, buying in order to sell dearer, M-C-M', appears certainly to be a form peculiar to one kind of capital alone, namely merchants' capital. But industrial capital too is money that is changed into commodities and by the sale of these commodities is re-converted into more money.

        The events that take place outside the sphere of circulation, in the interval between the buying and selling, do not affect the form of this movement. Lastly, in the case of interest-bearing capital, the circulation M-C-M' appears abridged. We have its result without the intermediate stage, in the form M-M', ""en style lapidaire"" so to say, money that is worth more money, value that is greater than itself.

        M-C-M' is therefore in reality the general formula of capital as it appears prima facie within the sphere of circulation. * * *

          CHAPTER VI. THE BUYING AND SELLING OF LABOUR-POWER

        The change of value that occurs in the case of money intended to be converted into capital, cannot take place in the money itself, since in its function of means of purchase and of payment, it does no more than realize the price of the commodity it buys or pays for; and, as hard cash, it is value petrified, never varying. Just as little can it originate in the second act of circulation, the re-sale of the commodity, which does no more than transform the article from its bodily form back again into its money-form . The change must, therefore, take p lace in the commodity bought by the first act, M-C, but not in its value, for equivalents are exchanged, and the commodity is p aid for at its full value. We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that the change originates in the use-value, as such, of the commodity, i.e., in its consumption. In order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity, our friend, Moneybags, must be so lucky as to find, within the sphere of circulation, in the market, a commodity, whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption, therefore, is itself an embodiment of labour, and consequently, a creation of value. The possessor of money does .find on the market such a special commodity in capacity for labour or labour-power.

        By labour-power or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any description.

        But in order that our owner of money may be able to find labour-power offered for sale as a commodity, various conditions must first be fulfilled. The exchange of commodities of itself implies no other relations of dependence than those which result from its own nature. On this assumption, labour-power can appear upon the market as a commodity, only if, and so far as, its possessor, the individual whose labour-power it is, offers it for sale, or sells it, as a commodity. In order that he may be able to do this, he must have it at his disposal, must be the untrammeled owner of his capacity for labour, i.e., of his person. He and the owner of money meet in the market, and deal with each other as on the basis of equal rights, with this difference alone, that one is buyer, the other seller; both, therefore, equal in the eyes of the law. The continuance of this relation demands that the owner of the labour-power should sell it only for a definite period, for it he were to sell it rump and stump, once for all, he would be selling himself, converting himself from a free man into a slave, from an owner of a commodity into a commodity. He must constantly look upon his labour-power as his own property, his own commodity, and this he can only do by placing it at the disposal of the buyer temporarily, for a definite period of time. By this means alone can he avoid renouncing his rights of ownership over it?

        The second essential condition to the owner of money finding labour-power in the market as a commodity is this-that the labourer instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his labour is incorporated, must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that very labour-power, which exists only in h is living self.

        In order that a man may be able to sell commodities other than labour-power, he must of course have the means of production, as raw material, implements, &C. No boots can be made without leather. He requires also the means of subsistence. Nobody-not even ""a musician of the future"" -can live upon future products, or upon use-values in an unfinished state; and ever since the first moment of his appearance on the world's stage, man always has been, and must still be a consumer, both before and while he is producing. In a society where all products assume the form of commodities, these commodities must be sold after they have been produced it is only after their sale that they can serve in satisfying the requirements of their producer. The time necessary for their sale is superadded to that necessary for their production.

        For the conversion of his money into capital, therefore, the owner of money must meet in the market with the free labourer, free in the double sense, that as a free man he can dispose of his labour-power as his own commodity, and that on the other hand he has no other commodity for sale, is short of everything necessary for the realisation of his labour-power.

        The question why this free labourer confronts him in the market has no interest for the owner of money, who regards the labour-market as a branch of the general market for commodities. And for the present it interests us just as little. We cling to the fact theoretically, as he does practically. One thing, however, is clear-Nature does not produce on the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men possessing nothing but their own labour-power. This relation has no natural basis, neither is its social basis one that is common to all historical periods. It is clearly the result of a past historical development, the product of many economic revolutions, of the extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production.

        So, too, the economic categories, already discussed by us, bear the stamp of history. Definite historical conditions are necessary that a product may become a commodity. It must not be produced as the immediate means of subsistence of the producer himself. Had we gone further, and inquired under what circumstances all or even the majority of products take the form of commodities, we should have found that this can only happen with production of a very specific kind, capitalist production. Such an inquiry, however, would have been foreign to the analysis of commodities. Production and circulation of commodities can take place, although the great mass of the objects produced are intended for the immediate requirements of their producers, a re not turned into commodities, and consequently social production is not yet by a long way dominated in its length and breadth by exchange-value. The appearance of products as commodities pre-supposes such a development of the social division of labour, that the separation of use-value from exchange value, a separation which first begins with barter, must already have been completed. But such a degree of development is common to many forms of society, which in other respects p resent the most varying historical features. On the other hand, if we consider money, its existence implies a definite stage in the exchange of commodities. The particular functions of money which it performs, either as the mere equivalent of commodities, or as means of circulation , or means of payment, as hoard or as universal money, point, according to the extent and relative preponderance of the one function or the other, to very different stages in the process of social production . Yet we know by experience that a circulation of commodities relatively primitive suffices for the production of all these forms. Otherwise with capital, the historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring into life, only when the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the market with the free labourer selling h is labour-power. And this one historical condition comprises a world's history. Capital, therefore, announces from its first appearance a new epoch in the process of social production.

        We must now examine more closely this peculiar commodity, labour-power. Like all others it has a value. How is that value determined?

        The value of labour-power is determined, as in the case of every other commodity, by the labour-time necessary for the production, and consequently also the reproduction, of this special article. So far as it has value, it represents no more than a definite quantity of the average labour of society incorporated in it. Labour-power exists only as a capacity, or power of the living individual. Its production consequently pre-supposes his existence. Given the individual, the production of labour-power consists in his reproduction of himself or his maintenance. For his maintenance h e requires a given quantity of the means of subsistence. Therefore the labour-time requisite for the production of labour-power reduces itself to that necessary for the production of those means of subsistence; in other words, the value of labour-power is the value of the means of subsistence necessary for the maintenance of the labourer. Labour power, however, becomes a reality only by its exercise; it sets itself in action only by working. But thereby a definite quantity of human muscle, nerve, brain, &c., is wasted, and these require to be restored. This increased expenditure demands a larger income. If the owner of labour-power works to-day, to-morrow he must again be able to repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health and strength . His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state as a labouring individual. His natural wants, such as food, clothing, fuel, and housing, vary according to the climatic and other physical conditions of his country. On the other hand, the number and extent of his so-called necessary wants, as also the modes of satisfying them, are themselves the product of historical development, and depend therefore to a great extent on the degree of civilization of a country, more particularly on the conditions under which, and consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which, the class of free labourers has been formed. In contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labour-power a historical and moral element. Nevertheless, in a given country, at a given period, the average quantity of the means of subsistence necessary for the labourer is practically known.

        The owner of labour-power is mortal. If then his appearance in the market is to be continuous, and the continuous conversion of money into capital assumes this, the seller of labour-power must pepetuate himself, ""in the way that every living individual perpetuates himself, by procreation."" The labour-power withdrawn from the market by wear and tear and death, must be continually replaced by, at the very least, an equal amount of fresh labour-power. Hence the sum of the means of subsistence necessary for the production of labour-power must include the means necessary for the labourer's substitutes, i. e., his children, in order that this race of peculiar commodity-owners may perpetuate its appearance in the market.

        In order to modify the human organism, so that it may acquire skill and handiness in a given branch of industry, and become labour-power of a special kind, a special education or training is requisite, and this, on its part, costs an equivalent in commodities of a greater or less amount. This amount varies according to the more or less complicated character of the labour-power. The expenses of this education (excessively small in the case of ordinary labour-power), enter pro tanto into the total value spent in its production.

        The value of labour-power resolves itself into the value of a definite quantity of the means of subsistence. It therefore varies with the value of these means or with the quantity of labour requisite for their production.

        We now know how the value paid by the purchaser to the possessor of the peculiar commodity, labour-power, is determined. The use-value which the former gets in exchange manifests itself only in the actual usufruct, in the consumption of the labour-power. The money-owner buys everything necessary for this purpose, such as raw material, in the market, and pays for i t at its full value. The consumption of labour-power is at one and the same time the production of commodities and of surplus-value. The consumption of labour-power is completed, as in the case of every other commodity, outside the limits of the market or of the sphere of circulation. Accompanied by Mr. :Moneybags and by the possessor of labour-power, we therefore take leave for a time of this noisy sphere, where everything takes place on the surface and in view of all men, and follow them both into the hidden abode of production, on whose threshold there stares us in the face ""No admittance except on business."" Here we shall see not only how capital produces, but how capital is produced. We shall at last force the secret of profit making.

        This sphere that we are deserting, within whose boundaries the sale and purchase of labour-power goes on is in fact a very Eden of the innate rights of man. There alone rule Freedom, Equality, Property and Bentham. Freedom because both buyer and seller of a commodity say of labour-power are constrained only by their own free will, They contract as free agents, and the agreement they come to, is but the form in which they give legal expression to their common will. Equality because each enters into relation with the other, as with a simple owner of commodities and they exchange equivalent for equivalent; Property, because each disposes only of what is his own. And Bentham, because each looks only to himself, the only force that brings them together and puts them in relation with each other, is the selfishness, the gain and the private interests of each. Each looks to himself only, and no one troubles himself about the rest, and just because they do so, do they all, in accordance with the pre-established harmony of things, or under the auspices of an all-shrewd providence, work together to their mutual advantage, for the common weal and in the interest of all.

        On leaving this sphere of simple circulation or of exchange of commodities, which furnishes the ""Free-trader Vulgaris"" with his views and ideas, and with the standard by which he judges a society based on capital and wages, we think we can perceive a change in the physiognomy of our dramatis personal. He, who before was the money-owner, now strides in front as capitalist the possessor of labour-power follows as his labourer. The one with an air of importance, smirking, intent on business; the other, timid and holding back, like one who is bringing his own hide to market and has nothing to expect but-a hiding.

1. I am inserting the parenthesis because its omission has often given rise to the misunderstanding that every product that is consumed by some one other than its producer is considered in Marx a commodity. [Engels, 4th German edition]

2. Compo.  Hegel, M""Philosophie des Rechts."" Berlin, 1 840. P. 250, § 190. [Marx]

3. The reader must note that we are not speaking here of the wages or value that the labourer gets f or a given labour-time, but of the value of the commodity in which that labour-time is materialised. Wages is a category that, as yet, has no existence at the present stage of our investigation. [Marx]

4. The celebrated Franklin, one of the first economists, after Wm. Petty, who saw through the nature of value, says: ""Trade in general being nothing else but the exchange of labour for labour, the value of all things is . . . most justly measured by labour."" (""The works of B. Franklin, &c.,"" edited by Sparks. Boston, 1836, Vol. II., p. 267.) Franklin is unconscious that by estimating the value of everything in labour, he makes abstraction from any difference in the sorts of labour exchanged, and thus reduced them all too equal human labour. But although ignorant of this, yet he says it. He speaks first of ""the one labour,"" then of• ""the other labour,"" and finally of ""labour,"" without further qualification as the substance of the value of everything. [Marx]

5. In a sort of way, it is with man as with commodities. Since he comes into the world neither with a looking glass in his hand, nor as a Fichtian philosopher, to whom ""I am I” is sufficient, man first sees and recognizes himself in other men. Peter only establishes his own identity as a man by first comparing himself with Paul as being of like kind. And thereby Paul, just as he stands in his Pauline personality. Becomes to Peter the type of the genus homo. [Marx]

6. Value is here, as occasionally in the preceding pages, used in sense of value determined as to quantity, or of value. [Marx]

7. Among the ancient Germans the unit for measuring land was what could be harvested in a day, and was called Tagwerk, Tagwanne (jurnale, or terra jurnalis, or diornalis), Mannsmaad. &c. (See G. L. von Maurer. ""Einleitung zur Geschichte der Mark-, &c. Verfassung,"" MUnchen, 1854, p. 129 sq) [Marx]

It is just nothing but a law of Nature founded on the want of knowledge of those whose action is the subject of it.""

1. Aristotle opposes Oeconomic to Chrematistic. He starts from the former. So far as it is the art of gaining a livelihood, it is limited to procuring those articles that are necessary to existence and useful either to a household or the state. ""True wealth consists of such values in use; for the quantity of possessions of this kind, capable of making life pleasant, is not unlimited. There is, however, a second mode of acquiring things, to which we may by preference and with correctness give the name of Chrematistic, and in this case there appear to be n o limits to riches and possessions. Trade (literally retail trade, and Aristotle takes this kind because in it values in use predominate) does not in its nature belong to Chrematistic, for here the exchange has reference only t o what i s necessary to themselves (the buyer or seller}."" Therefore, as he goes on to show, the original form of trade was barter, but with the extension of the latter, there arose the necessity for money. On the discovery of money, barter of necessity developed into trading in commodities, and this again, in opposition to its original tendency, grew into Chrematistic, into the art of making money. Now Chrematistic is distinguishable from Oeconomic in this way that in the case of Chrematistic circulation is the source of riches. And it appears to revolve about money, for money is the beginning and end of this kind of exchange. Therefore also riches, such as Chrematistic strives for, are unlimited. Just as every art that is not a means to an end, but an end in itself, has no limit to its aims, because it seeks constantly to approach nearer and nearer to that end, while those arts that pursue means to an end, are not boundless, since the goal itself imposes a limit upon them, so with Chrematistic, there are no bounds to its aims, these aims being absolute wealth. Oeconomic not Chrematistic has a limit . . . the object of the former is something different from money, of the latter the augmentation of money. . . . By confounding these two forms, which overlap each other, some people have been led to look upon the preservation and increase of money ad infinitum as the end and aim of Oecono mic."" (Aristoteles, ""DeRep."" edit. Bekker. lib. I.c. 8, 9. passim.) [Marx]

2. In encyclopaedias of classical antiquities we find such nonsense as this that in the ancient world capital was fully developed, ""except that the free labourer and a system of credit were wanting."" Mommsen also, in his ""History of Rome,"" commits, in this respect, one blunder after another. [MaTx]

3. Hence legislation in various countries fixes a maximum for labour-contracts. Wherever free labour is the rule, the laws regulate the mode of terminating this contract. In some States, particularly in Mexico (before the American Civil War, also in the territories taken from Mexico, and also, as a matter of fact, in the Danubian provinces till the revolution effected by Kusa), slavery is hidden under the form of peonage. By means of advances, repayable in labour, which are handed down from generation to generation, not only the individual labourer, but his family, become, de jacto, the property of other persons and their families. Juarez abolished peonage. The so-called Emperor Maximilian re-established it by a decree, which, in the House of Representatives at Washington, was aptly denounced as a decree for the re-introduction of slavery into Mexico. ""I may make over to another the use, for a limited time, of my particular bodily and mental aptitudes and capabilities; because in consequence of this restriction, they are impressed with a character of alienation with regard to me as a whole. But by the alienation of all my labour-time and the whole of my work, I should be converting the substance itself, in other words, my general activity and reality, my person, into the property of another."" (Hegel, Philosophie des
Rechts, Berlin, 1840, p. 104, § 67.) [Marx]

4. The capitalist epoch is therefore characterised by this, that labour power takes in the eyes o f the labourer himself the form of a commodity which is his property; his labour consequently becomes wage-labour. On the other hand, it is only from this moment that the produce of labour universally becomes a commodity. [Marx]

5. ""The value or worth of a man, is as of all other things his price-that is to say, so much as would b e given for the use of his power."" (Thomas. Hobbes, Leviathan, in Works, ed. Molesworth, London, 1 8 3 9-44, Vol. III, p. 7 6 . ) [Marx}

6. Hence the Roman Villicus, as overlooker of the agricultural slaves, received ""more meagre fare than working slaves, because his work was lighter."" (Theodor Mommsen, Riimisches Geschichte, 1856, p. 810.) [Marx]

7. Compare W. T. Thornton, Over Population and Its Remedy, London, 1846. [Marx]

                    Part III. The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value

             CHAPTER VI I. THE LABOUR PROCESS AND THE PROCESS OF                                         PRODUCING SURPLUS

             Section 1. The Labour-Process or the Production of Use-Values

        The capitalist buys labour-power in order to use it; and labourpower in use is labour itself. The purchaser of labour-power consumes it by setting the seller of it to work. By working, the latter becomes actually, what before he only was potentially, labour-power in action, a labourer. In order that his labour may re-appear in a commodity, he must, before all things, expend it on something useful, on something capable of satisfying a want of some sort. Hence, what the capitalist sets the labourer to produce is a particular use-value, a specified article. The fact that the production of use-values or goods, is carried on under the control o f a capitalist and on his behalf, does not alter the general character of that production. We shall, therefore, in the first place, have to consider the labour-process independently of the particular form it assumes under given social conditions.

        Labour is, in the first place, a process in which both man and Nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material re-actions between himself and Nature. He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces, setting in motion arms and legs, head and hands, the natural forces of his body, in order to appropriate Nature's productions in a form adapted to his own wants By thus acting on the external world and changing it, he at the same time changes his own nature/ He develops his slumbering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway. We are not now dealing with those primitive instinctive forms of labour that remind us of the mere animal. An immeasurable interval of time separates the state of things in which a man brings his labour-power to market for sale as a commodity, from that state in which human labour was still in its first instinctive stage. We pre-suppose labour in a form that stamps it as exclusively human. A spider conducts operations that resemble those of a weaver, and a bee puts to shame many an architect in the construction of her cells. But what distinguishes the worst architect from the best of bees is this, that the architect raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality. At the end of every labour- process, we get it result that already existed in the imagination of the labourer at its commencement. He not only effects a change of form in the material on which he works, but he also realises a purpose of his own that gives the law to his modus operandi, and to which he must subordinate his will . And this subordination is no mere momentary act. Besides the exertion of the bodily organs, the process demands that, during the whole operation, the workman's will be steadily in consonance with his purpose. This means close attention. The less he is attracted by the nature of the work, and the mode in which •it is carried on, and the less, therefore, he enjoys it as something which gives play to his bodily and mental powers, the more close his attention is forced to be.

        The elementary factors of the labour-process are ( 1 ) , the personal activity of man, i.e., work itself, ( 2 ) , the subject of that work, and ( 3 ) , its instruments.

        The soil ( and this, economically speaking, includes water) in the virgin state in which it supplies man with necessaries or the means of subsistence ready to hand, exists independently of him, and is the universal subject of human labour. All those things which labour merely separates from immediate connexion with their environment are subjects of labour spontaneously provided by Nature. Such are fish which we catch and take from their element, water, timber which we fell in the virgin forest and ores which we extract from their veins. I f, on the other hand, the subject of labour has, so to say, been filtered through previous labour, we call it raw material; such is ore already extracted and ready for washing. All raw materials are the subject of labour, but not every subject of labour is raw material: it can only become so, after it has undergone some alteration by means of labour.

        An instrument of labour is a thing, or a complex of .things, which the labourer interposes between himself and the subject of his labour, and which serves as the conductor of his activity. He makes use of the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of some substances in order to make other substances subservient to his aims. Leaving out of consideration such ready-made means of subsistence a s fruits, in gathering which a man's own limbs serve as the instruments of his labour, the first thing of which the labourer possesses himself is not the subject of labour but its instrument. Thus Nature becomes one of the organs of his activity, one that he annexes to his own bodily organs, adding stature to himself in spit of the Bible, As the earth is his original larder, so too it is his original tool house. It supplies him, for instance, with stones for throwing, grinding, pressing, cutting, &c. The earth itself is an instrument of labour, but when used as such in agriculture implies a whole series of other instruments and a comparatively high development of labour. No sooner does labour undergo the least development, than it requires specially prepared instruments. Thus in the oldest caves we find stone implements and weapons. In the earliest period of human history domesticated animals, i.e., animals which have been bred for the purpose, and have undergone modifications by means of labour, play the chief part as instruments of labour along with specially prepared stones, wood, bones, and shells. The use and fabrication of instruments of labour, although existing in the germ among certain species of animals, is specifically characteristic of the human labour-process, and Franklin therefore defines man as a tool-making animal. Relics of bygone instruments of labour possess the same importance for the investigation of extinct economic forms of society, as do fossil bones for the determination of extinct species of animal s. It is not the articles made, but how they are made, and by what instruments, that enables us to distinguish different economic epochs. Instruments of labour not only supply a standard of the degree of development to which human labour has attained, but they are also indicators of the social conditions under which that labour is carried on . Among the instruments of labour, those of a mechanical nature, which, taken as a whole, we may call the bone and muscles of production, offer much more decided characteristics of a given epoch of production, than those which, like pipes, tubs, baskets, jars, &c., serve only to hold the materials for labour, which latter class, we may in a general way, call the vascular system of production. The latter first begins to play an important part in the chemical industries.

        In a wider sense we m a y include among the instruments of labour, in addition to those things that are used for directly transferring labour to its subject, and which therefore, in one way or another, serve as conductors of activity, all such objects as are necessary for carrying on the labour-process. These do not enter directly into the process, but without them it is either impossible for it to take place at all, or possible only to a partial extent. Once more we find the earth to be a universal instrument of this sort, for it furnishes a locus stand to the labourer and a field of employment for his activity. Among instruments that are the result of previous labour and also belong to this class, we find workshops, canals, roads, and so forth.

        In the labour-process, therefore, man's activity, with the help of the instruments of labour, effects an alteration, designed from the commencement, in the material worked upon. The process disappears in the product; the latter is a use-value, Nature's material; adapted by a change of form to the wants of man. Labour has incorporated itself with its subject: the former is materialised, the latter transformed. That which in the labourer appeared as movement, now appears in the product as a fixed quality without motion. The blacksmith forges and the product is a forging.

        If we examine the whole process from the point of view o f its result, the product, it is plain that both the instruments and the subject of labour, are means of production, and that the labour itself is productive labour.

        Though a use-value, in the form of a product, issues from the labour-process, yet other use-values, products of previous labour, enter into it as means of production. The same use-value is both the product of a previous process and a means of production in a later process. Products are therefore not only results, but also essential conditions of labour.

        With the exception of the extractive industries, in which the material for labour is provided immediately by Nature, such as mining, hunting, fishing, and agriculture (so far as the latter is con- , fined to breaking up virgin soil), all branches of industry manipulate raw material, objects already filtered through labour, already products of labour. Such is seed in agriculture. Animals and plants, which we are accustomed to consider as products of Nature, are in their present form, not only products of, say last year's labour, but the result of a gradual transformation, continued through many generations, under man's superintendence, and by means of his labour, But in the great majority of cases, instruments of labour show even to the most superficial observer, traces of the labour of past ages.

        Raw material may either form the principal substance of a product, or it may enter into its formation only as an accessory. An accessory may be consumed by the instruments of labour, as coal under a boiler, oil by a wheel, hay by draft-horses, or it may be mixed with the raw material in order to produce some modification thereof, as chlorine into unbleached linen, coal with iron, dye-stuff with wool, or again, it may help to carry on the work itself, as in the case of the materials used for heating and lighting workshops. The distinction between principal substance and accessory vanishes in the true chemical industries, because there none of the r a w material re-appears, in its original composition, in the substance of the product.

        Every object possesses various properties, and is thus capable of being applied to different uses. One and the same product may therefore serve as raw material in very different processes. Corn, for example, is a raw material for millers, starch-manufacturers, distillers, and cattle-breeders. It also enters as raw material into its own production in the shape of seed; coal, too, is at the same time the product of, and a means of production in, coal-mining.

        Again, a particular product may be used in one and the same process, both as an instrument of labour and as raw material. Take, for instance, the fattening of cattle, where the animal is the raw material and a t the same time an instrument for the production of manure.

        A product, though ready for immediate consumption, may yet serve as raw material for a further product, as grapes when they become the raw material for wine. On the other hand, labour may give us its product in such a form, that we can use it only as raw material, as is the case with cotton, thread, and yarn  Such a raw material, though itself a product, may have to go through a whole series of different processes: in each of these in turn, it serves, with constantly varying form, as raw material, until the last process of the series leaves it a perfect product, ready for individual consumption, or for use as an instrument of labour.

        Hence we see, that whether a use-value is to be regarded as raw material, as instrument of labour, or as product, this is determined entirely by its function in the labour-process, by the position it there occupies: as this varies, so does its character.

        Whenever therefore a product enters as a means o f production into a new labour-process, it thereby loses its character of product, and becomes a mere factor in the process. A spinner treats spindles only as implements for spinning, and flax only as the material that he spins. Of course it is impossible to spin without material and spindles; and therefore the existence of these things as products, at the commencement of the spinning operation, must be presumed: but in the process itself, the fact that they are products of previous labour, is a matter of utter indifference; just as in the digestive process, it is of n o importance whatever, that bread is the produce of the previous labour of the farmer, the miller, and the baker. On the contrary, it is generally by their imperfections as products, that the means of production in any process assert themselves in their character of products. A blunt knife or weak thread forcibly reminds us of Mr. A., the cutler, or Mr. B., the spinner. In the finished product the labour by means o f which it has acquired its useful qualities is not palpable, has apparently vanished.

        A machine which does not serve the purposes of labour is useless. In addition, it falls a prey to the distractive influence of natural forces. Iron rusts and wood rots. Yarn with which we neither weave nor knit, is cotton wasted. Living labour must seize upon these things and rouse them from their death-sleep, change them from mere possible use-values into real and effective ones. Bathed in the fire of labour, appropriated as part and parcel of labour's organism, and, as it were, made alive for the performance of their functions in the process, they are in truth consumed, but consumed with a purpose, as elementary constituents of new use-values, of new products, ever ready as means of subsistence for individual consumption, or as means of production for some new labour-process.

        If then, on the one hand, finished products are not only results, but also necessary conditions, of the labour-process, on the other hand, their assumption into that process, their contact with living labour, is the sale means by which they can be made to retain their character of use-values, and be utilized.

        Labour uses up its material factors, its subject and its instruments, consumes them, and is therefore a process of consumption. Such productive consumption is distinguished from individual consumption by this, that the latter uses up products, as means of subsistence for the living individual; the former, as means whereby alone, labour, the labour-power of the living individual, is enabled to act. The product, therefore, of individual consumption, is the consumer himself; the result of productive consumption is a product distinct from the consumer.

        In so far then, as its instruments and subjects are themselves products, labour consumes products in order to create products, or in other words, consumes one set of products by turning them into means of production for another set. But, just as in the beginning, the only participators in the labour-process were man and the earth, which latter exists 'independently of man, so even now we still employ in the process many means of production, provided directly by Nature, that do not represent any combination of natural substances with human labour.

        The labour-process, resolved as above into its simple elementary factors, is human action with a view to the production of use-values, appropriation of natural substances to human requirements; it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and Nature; it is the everlasting Nature-imposed condition of human existence, and therefore is independent of every social phase of that existence, or rather, is common to every such phase. It was, therefore, not necessary to represent our labourer in connexion with other labourers; man and his labour on one side, Nature and its materials on the other, sufficed . As the taste of the porridge does not tell you who grew the oats, no m ore does this simple process tell you of itself what are the social conditions under which it is taking place, whether under the slave-owner's brutal lash, or the anxious eye of the capitalist, whether Cincinnatus carries it on in tilling his modest farm or a savage in killing wild animals with stones.

        Let us now return to our would-be capitalist. We left him just after he had purchased, in the open market, all the necessary factors of the labour-process; its objective factor, the means of production, as well as its subjective factor, labour-power. With the keen eye of an expert, he has selected the means of production and the kind of labour-power best adapted to his particular trade, be it spinning, bootmaking, or any other kind. He then proceeds to consume the commodity, the labour-power that he has just bought, by causing the labourer, the impersonation of that labour-power, to consume the means of production by his labour. The general character of the labour-process is evidently not changed by the fact that the labourer works for the capitalist instead of for himself; moreover, the particular methods and operations employed in boot making or spinning are not immediately changed by the intervention of the capitalist. He must begin by taking the labour-power as he finds it in the market, and consequently be satisfied with labour of such a kind as would be found in the period immediately preceding the rise of capitalists. Changes in the methods of production by the subordination of labour to capital, can take place only at a later period, and therefore will have to be treated of in a later chapter.

        The labour-process, turned into the process by which the capitalist consumes labo ur-power, exhibits two characteristic phenomena. First, the labourer works under the control of the capitalist to whom his labour belongs; the capitalist taking good care that the work is done in a proper manner, and that the means of production a re used with intelligence, so that there is no unnecessary waste of raw material, and no wear and tear of the implements beyond what is necessarily caused by the work.

        Secondly, the product is the property of the capitalist and not that of the labourer, its immediate producer. Suppose that a capitalist pays for a day's labour-power at its value; then the right to use that power for a day belongs to him, just as much a s the right to use any other commodity, such as a horse that he has hired for the day. To the purchaser of a commodity belongs its use, and the seller of labour-power, by giving his labour, does no more, in reality, than part with the use-value that he has sold. From the instant he steps into the workshop, the use-value of his labour-power, and therefore also its use, which is labour, belongs to the capitalist. By the purchase of labour-power, the capitalist incorporates labour, as a living ferment, with t h e lifeless constituents of the product. From his point of view, the labour-process is nothing more than the consumption of the commodity purchased, i. e., of lab our-power; but this consumption cannot be effected except by supplying the labour-power with the means of production. The labour-process is a process between things that the capitalist has purchased, things that have become his property. The product of this process belongs, therefore, to him, just as much as does the wine which is the product of a process of fermentation completed in his cellar.

                           Section 2. The Production of Surplus-Value

        The product appropriated by the capitalist is a use-value, as yarn, for example, or boots. But, although boots are, in one sense, the basis of all social progress, and our capitalist is a decided ""progressist,"" yet he does not manufacture boots for their own sake. Use value is, by no means, the thing ""qu'on aime pour lui-meme"" in the production of commodities. Use-values are only produced by capitalists, because, and in so far as, they are the material substratum, the depositories of exchange-value. Our capitalist has two objects in view: in the first place, he wants to produce a use-value. that has a value in exchange, that is to say, an article destined to be sold, a commodity; and secondly, he desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities used in its production, that is, of the means of production and the labour-power, that he purchased with his good money in the open market. His aim is to produce not only a usevalue, but a commodity also; not only use-value, but value; not only value, but a t the same time surplus-value.

        It must be borne in mind that we are now dealing with the production of commodities, and that, up to this point we have only considered one aspect of the process. Just as commodities are at the same time, use-values and values, so the process of producing them must be a labour process, and at the same time, a process of creating value.

        Let us now examine production as a creation of value. We know that the value of each commodity is determined by the quantity of labour expended on and materialised in it, by the working-time necessary, under given social conditions, for its production. This rule also holds good in the case o f the product that accrued to our capitalist, as the result of the labour-process carried on for him. Assuming this product to be 10 lbs. of yarn, our first step is to calculate the quantity of labour realised in it.

        For spinning the yarn, raw material is required; suppose in this case 10 lbs. of cotton. We have no need at present to investigate the value of this cotton, for our capitalist has, we will assume, bought it at its full value, say of ten shillings. In this price the labour required for the production of the cotton is already expressed in terms of the average labour of society. We will further assume that the wear and tear of the spindle, which, for our present purpose, may represent all other instruments of labour employed, amounts to the value of 2 S. If, then, twenty-four hours labour, or two working-days are required to produce the quantity of gold represented by twelve shillings, we have here, to begin with, two days labour already incorporated in the yarn .

        We must not let ourselves be misled by the circumstance that the cotton has taken a new shape while the substance of the spindle has to a certain extent been used up. B y the general law of value, if the value of 40 lbs. of yarn = the value of 40 lbs. of cotton + the value of a whole spindle, i. e., if the same working-time is required to produce the commodities on either side of this equation, then 10 lbs. of yarn a re a n equivalent for 10 lbs. of cotton, together with one-fourth of a spindle. In the case we are considering the same working-time is materialised in the 10 lbs. of yarn on the one hand, and in the 10 lbs. of cotton and the fraction of a spindle on the other. Therefore, whether value appears in cotton, in a spindle, or in yarn, makes no difference in the amount of that value. The spindle and cotton, instead of resting quietly side by side, join together in the process, their forms are altered, and they are turned into yarn; but their value is no more affected by this fact than it would be if they had been simply exchanged for their equivalent in yarn.

        The labour required for the production of the cotton, the raw material of the yarn, is part of the labour necessary to produce the yarn, and is therefore contained in the yarn. The same applies to the labour embodied in the spindle, without whose wear and tear the cotton could not be spun.

        Hence, in determining the value of the yarn, or the labour-time required for its production, all the special processes carried on at various times and in different places, which were necessary, first to produce the cotton and the wasted portion of the spindle, and then with the cotton and spindle to spin the yarn, may together be looked on as different and successive phases of one and the same process. The whole of the labour in the yarn is past labour; and it is a matter of no importance that the operations necessary for the production of its constituent elements were carried on at times which, referred to the present, are more remote than the final operation of spinning. If a definite quantity of labour, say thirty days is requisite to build a house, the total amount of labour incorporated in it is not altered by the fact that the work of the last day is done twenty-nine days later than that of the first. Therefore the labour contained in the raw material and the instruments of labour can be treated just as if it were labour expended in an earlier stage of the spinning process, before the labour of actual spinning commenced.

        The values of the means of production, i. e., the cotton and the spindle, which values are expressed in the price of twelve shillings, are therefore constituent parts of the value of the yarn, or, in other words, of the value o f the product.

        Two conditions must nevertheless be fulfilled. First, the cotton and spindle must concur in the production of a use-value; they must in the present case become yarn. Value is independent of the particular use-value by which it is borne, but it must be embodied in a use-value of some kind. Secondly, the time occupied in the labour of production must not exceed the time really necessary under the given social conditions of the case. Therefore, if no more than 1 lb. of cotton be requisite to spin I lb. of yarn, care must be taken that no more than this weight of cotton is consumed in the production of I lb. of yarn; and similarly with regard to the spindle. Though the capitalist have a hobby, and use a gold instead of a steel spindle, yet the only labour that counts for anything in the value of the yarn is that which would be required to produce a steel spindle, because no more is necessary under the given social conditions.

        We now know what portion of the value of the yarn is owing to the cotton and the spindle. It amounts to twelve shillings or the value of two days work. The next point for our consideration is what portion of the value of the yarn is added to the cotton by the labour of the spinner.

        We have now to consider this labour under a very different aspect from that which it had during the labour-process; there, we viewed it solely as that particular kind of human activity which changes cotton into yarn; there, the more the labour was suited to the work, the better the yarn, other circumstances remaining the same. The labour of the spinner was then viewed as specifically different from other kinds of productive labour, different on the one hand in its special aim, viz., spinning, different, on the other hand, in the special character of its operations, in the special nature of its means of production and in the special use-value of its product. For the operation of spinning, cotton and spindles are a necessity, but for making rifled cannon they would be of no use whatever. Here, on the contrary, where we consider the labour of the spinner only so far as it is value-creating, i.e., a source of value, his labour differs in no respect from the labour of the man who bores cannon, or ( what here more nearly concerns us ) , from the labour of the cotton-planter and spindle-maker incorporated in the means of production. It is solely by reason of this identity, that cotton planting, spindle making and spinning, are capable of forming the component parts, differing only quantitatively from each other, of one whole, namely, the value of the yarn. Here, we have nothing more to do with the quality, the nature and the specific character of the labour, but merely with its quantity. And this simply requires to be calculated. We proceed upon the assumption that spinning is simple, unskilled labour, the average labour of a given state of society. Hereafter we shall see that the contrary assumption would make no difference.

        While the labourer is at work, his labour constantly undergoes a transformation: from being motion, it becomes an object without motion; from being the labourer working, it becomes the thing produced. At the end of one hour's spinning, that act is represented by a definite quantity of yarn; in other words, a definite quantity of labour, namely that of one hour, has become embodied in the cotton. We say labour, i.e., the expenditure of his vital force by the spinner, and not spinning labour, because the special work of spinning counts here, only so far as it is the expenditure of labourpower in general, and not in so far as it is the specific work of the spinner.

        In the process we are now considering it is of extreme importance, that no more time be consumed in the work of transforming the cotton into yarn than is necessary under the given social conditions If under normal, i.e., average social conditions of production, a pounds of cotton ought to be m a de into b pounds of yarn by one hour's labour, then a day's labour does not count as 12 hours labour unless 12 a pounds of cotton have been made into 12b pounds of yam ; for in the creation of value, the time that is socially necessary alone counts.

        Not only the labour, but also the raw material and the product now appear in quite a new light, very different from that in which we viewed them in the labour-process pure and simple. The raw material serves now merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labour. By this absorption it is in fact changed into yarn, because it is spun, because labour-power in the form of spinning is added to it; but the product, the yarn, is now nothing more than a measure of the labour absorbed by the cotton. If in one hour 1 2/3 lbs. of cotton can be spun into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn, then 10 lbs. of yarn indicate the absorption of 6 hours' labour. Definite quantities of product, these quantities being determined by experience now represent nothing but definite quantities of labour, definite masses of crystallised labour-time. They are nothing more than the materialization of so many hours or so many days of social labour.

        We are here no more concerned about the facts, that the labour is the specific work of spinning, that it s subject is cotton and its product yarn, than we are about the fact that the subject itself is already a product and therefore raw material. If the spinner, instead of spinning, were working in a coal mine, the subject of his labour, the coal, would be supplied by Nature; nevertheless, a definite quantity of extracted coal, a hundredweight for example, would represent a definite quantity of absorbed labour.

        We assumed, on the occasion of its sale, that the value of a day's labour-power is three shillings, and that six hours' labour is incorporated in that sum; and consequently that this amount of labour is requisite to produce the necessaries of life daily required on an average by the labourer. If now our spinner by working for one hour can convert 1 2/3 lbs. of cotton into 1 2/3 lbs. of yarn, it follows that in six hours he will convert 10 lbs. of cotton into 10 lbs. of yarn. Hence, during the spinning process, the cotton absorbs six hours labour. The same quantity of labour is also embodied in a piece of gold of the value of three shillings. Consequently by the mere labour of spinning, a value of three shillings is added to the cotton.

        Let us now consider the total value of the product the 10 lbs. of yarn, Two and a half days labour has been embodied in it, of which two days were contained in the cotton and in the substance of the spindle worn away, and half a day was absorbed during the process of spinning. This two and a half days' labour is also represented by a piece of gold of the value of fifteen shillings. Hence, fifteen shillings is an adequate price for the 10 lbs. of yarn, or the price of one pound is eighteen pence.

        Our capitalist stares ill astonishment. The value of the product is exactly equal to the value of the capital advanced. The value so advanced has not expanded, no surplus-value has been created, and consequently money has not been converted into capital. The price of the yarn is fifteen shillings, and fifteen shil1ings were spent in the open market upon the constituent elements of the product, or, what amounts to the same thing, upon the factors of the labour process; ten shillings were paid for the cotton, two shillings for the substance of the spindle worn away, and three shillings for the labour-power. The swollen value of the yarn is of no avail, for it is merely the sum of the values formerly existing in the cotton, the spindle, and the labour-power: out of such a simple addition of existing values, no surplus-value can possibly arise. These separate values are now all concentrated in one thing; but so they were also in the sum of fifteen shillings, before it was split up into three parts, by the purchase of the commodities. There is in reality nothing very strange in this result. The value of one pound of yarn being eighteen pence, if our capitalist buys 10 lbs. of yarn in the market, h e must pay fifteen shillings for them. It is clear that, whether a man buys his house ready built, or gets it built for him, in neither case will the mode of acquisition increase the amount of money laid out on the house.

        Our capitalist, who is at home in his vulgar economy, exclaims: ""Oh! But I advanced my money for the express purpose of making more money."" The way to Hell is paved with good intentions, and he might just as easily have intended to make money, without producing at all. He threatens all sorts of things. He won't be caught napping again. In future he will buy the commodities in the market, instead of manufacturing them himself. But if all his brother capitalists were to do the same, where would he find his commodities in the market? And his money he cannot eat. He tries persuasion. ""Consider my abstinence; I might have played ducks and drakes with the 15 shillings; but instead of that I consumed it productively, and made yarn with it."" Very well, and by way of reward he is now in possession of good yarn instead of a bad conscience; and as for playing the part of the miser; it would never do for him to relapse into such bad ways as that; we have seen before to what results such asceticism lead. Besides, where nothing is, the king has lost his rights; whatever may be the merit of his abstinence, there is nothing wherewith specially to remunerate it, because the value of the product is merely the sum of the values of the commodities that were thrown into the process of production. Let him therefore console himself with the reflection that virtue is its own reward. But no, he becomes importunate. He says: ""The yarn .is of no use to me: I produced it for sale."" In that case let him sell it, or, still better, let him for the future produce only things for satisfying his personal wants, a remedy that his physician MacCulloch has already prescribed as infallible against an epidemic of over-production. He now gets obstinate. ""Can the labourer,"" he asks, ""merely with his arms and legs, produce commodities out of nothing? Did I not supply him with the materials, by means of which, and in which alone, his labour could be embodied? And as the greater part of society consists of such never-do-wells, have I not rendered society incalculable service by my instruments of production, my cotton and my spindle, and not only society, but the labourer also, whom in addition I .have provided with the necessaries of life? And am I to be allowed nothing in return for all this service?"" Well, but has not the labourer rendered him the equivalent service of changing his cotton and spindle into yarn? Moreover, there is here no question of service. A service is nothing more than the useful effect of a use-value, be it of a commodity, or be it of labour. But here we are dealing with exchange-value. The capitalist paid to the labourer a value of 3 shillings, and the labourer gave him back an exact equivalent in the value of 3 shillings, added by him to the cotton : he gave him value for value. Our friend, up to this time so purse-proud, suddenly assumes the modest demean our of his own workman, and exclaims: ""Have I myself not worked? Have I not performed the labour of superintendence and of overlooking the spinner? And does not this labour, too, create value?"" His over looker and his manager try to hide their smiles. Meanwhile, after a hearty laugh, he re-assumes his usual mien. Though h e chanted to us the whole creed of the economists, in reality, he says, he would not give a brass farthing for it. He leaves this and all such like subterfuges and juggling tricks to the professors of Political Economy, who are paid for it. He himself is a practical man; and though he does not always consider what he says outside his business, yet in his business he knows what he is about.

        Let us examine the matter more closely, The value of a day's labour-power amounts to 3 shillings, because on our assumption half a day's labour is embodied in that quantity of labour-power, i.e., because the means of subsistence that are daily required for the production of labour-power, cost half a day's labour. But the past labour that is embodied in the labour-power, and the living labour that it can call into action; the daily cost of maintaining it, and its daily expenditure in work, are two totally different things. The former determines the exchange-value of the labour-power the latter is its use-value. The fact that half a day's labour is necessary to keep the labourer alive during 24 hours does not in any way prevent him from working a whole day. Therefore, the value of labour-power and the value which that labour-power creates in the labour-process are two entirely different magnitudes; and this difference of the two values was what the capitalist had in view, when he was purchasing the labour-power. The useful qualities that labour-power possesses, and by virtue of which it makes yam or boots, were to him nothing more than a conditio sine qua non; for in order to create value, labour must be expended in a useful manner. What really influenced him was the specific use-value which this commodity possesses of being a source not only of value, but of more value than it has itself. This is the special service that the capitalist expects from labour-power, and in this transaction he acts in accordance with the ""eternal laws"" of the exchange of commodities. The seller of labour-power, like the seller of any other commodity, realises its exchange-value, and parts with its use-value. He cannot take the one without giving the other. The use-value of labour-power, or in other words, labour, belongs just as little to its seller, as the use-value of oil after it has been sold belongs to the dealer who has sold it. The owner of the money has paid the value of a day's labour-power; his, therefore, is the use of it for a day; a day's labour belongs to him. The circumstance, that on the one hand the daily sustenance of labour-power costs only half a days labour, while on the other hand the very same labour-power can work during a whole day, that consequently the value which its use during one day creates, is double what he pays for that use, this circumstance is, without doubt, a piece of good luck for the buyer, but by no means an injury to the seller.

        Our capitalist foresaw this state of things, and that was the cause of his laughter. The labourer therefore finds, in the workshop, the means of production necessary for working, not only during six, but during twelve hours. Just as during the six hours' process our ' 10 lbs. of cotton absorbed six hours' labour, and became 10 lbs. of yarn, so now, 20 lbs. of cotton will absorb 12 hours' labour and be changed into 20 lbs. of yarn. Let us now examine the product of this prolonged process. There is now materialised in this 20 lbs. of yarn the labour of five days, of which four days are due to the cotton and the lost steel of the spindle, the remaining day having been absorbed by the cotton during the spinning process. Expressed in gold, the labour of five days is thirty shillings. This is therefore the price of the 20 lbs. of yarn, giving, as before, eighteen pence as the price of a pound. But the sum of the values of the commodities that entered into the process amounts to 27 shillings. The value of the yarn is 30 shillings. Therefore the value of the product is 1/9 greater than the value advanced for its production; 27 shillings have been transformed into 30 shillings; a surplus-value of 3 shillings has been created. The trick has at last succeeded; money has been converted into capital.

        Every condition of the problem i s satisfied, while the laws that regulate the exchange of commodities, have been in no way violated. Equivalent has been exchanged for equivalent. For the capitalist as buyer paid for each commodity, for the cotton, the spindle and the labour-power, its full value. He then did what is done by every purchaser of commodities; he consumed their use-value. The consumption of the labour-power, which was also the process of producing commodities, resulted in 20 lbs. of yarn, having a value of 30 shillings. The capitalist, formerly a buyer, now returns to market as a seller, of commodities. He sells his yarn at eighteen pence a pound, which is its exact value. Yet for all that he withdraws 3 shillings more from circulation than he originally threw into it. This metamorphosis, this conversion of money into capital, takes place both within the sphere of circulation and also outside it; within the circulation, because conditioned by the purchase of the labour power in the market; outside the circulation, because what is done within it is only a stepping-stone to the production of surplus-value, a process which is entirely confined to the sphere of production. Thus ""tout est pour Ie mieux dans Ie meilleur des mondes possibles.""

        By turning his money into commodities that serve as the ma terial elements of a new product, and as factors in the labour-process, by incorporating living labour with their dead substance, the capitalist at the same time converts value, i.e., past, materialised, and dead labour into capital, into value big with value, a live monster that is fruitful and multiplies.

        If we now compare the two processes of producing value and of creating surplus-value, we see that the latter is nothing but the continuation of the former beyond a definite point. If on the one hand t he process be not carried beyond the point, where the value paid by the capitalist for the labour-power is replaced by an exact equivalent, it is simply a process of producing value; if, on the other hand, it be continued beyond that point, it becomes a process of creating surplus-value.

        If we proceed further, and compare the process of producing value with the labour-process, pure and simple, we find that the latter consists of the useful labour, the work that produces use values. Here we contemplate the labour as producing a particular article; we view it under its qualitative aspect alone, with regard to its end and aim. But viewed as a value-creating process, the same labour-process presents itself under its quantitative aspect alone. Here it is a question merely of the time occupied b y the labourer in doing the work; of the period during which the labour-power is usefully expended. Here, the commodities that take part in the process, do not count any longer as necessary adjuncts of labour-power in the production of a definite, useful object. They count merely as depositories of so much absorbed or materialised labour; that labour, whether previously embodied in the means of production, or incorporated in them for the first time during the process of the action of labour-power, counts in either case only according to its duration; it amounts to so many hours or days as the case may be.

        Moreover, only so much of the time spent in the production of any article is counted, as, under the given social conditions, is necessary. The consequences of this are various. In the first place, it becomes necessary that the labour should be carried on under normal conditions. If a self-acting mule is the implement in general use for spinning, it would be absurd to supply the spinner with a distaff and spinning wheel. The cotton too must not be such rubbish as to cause extra waste in being worked, but must be of suitable quality. Otherwise the spinner would be found to spend more time in producing a pound of yarn than is socially necessary, in which case the excess of time would create neither value nor money. But whether the material factors of the process are of normal quality or not, depends not upon the labourer, but entirely upon the capitalist. Then again, the labour-power itself must be of average efficacy. I n the trade in which it is being employed, it must possess the average skill, handiness and quickness prevalent in that trade, and Our capitalist took good care to buy labour-power of such normal goodness. This power must be applied with the average amount of exertion and with the usual degree of intensity; and the capitalist is as careful to see that this is done, as that his workmen are not idle for a single moment. He has bought the use of the labour-power for a definite period, and he insists upon his rights. He has no intention of being robbed. Lastly, and for this purpose our friend has a penal code of his own, a]] wasteful consumption of raw material or instruments of labour is strictly forbidden, because what is so wasted, represents labour superfluously expended, labour that does not count in the product or enter into its value.

        We now see, that the difference between labour, considered on the one hand as producing utilities, and on the other hand, as creating value, a difference which we discovered by our analysis of a commodity, resolves itself into a distinction between two aspects of the process of production.

        The process of production, considered on the one hand as the unity of the labour-process and the process of creating value, is production of commodities; considered on the other hand as the unity of the labour-process and the process of producing surplus value, it is the capitalist process o f production, or capitalist production of commodities.

        We stated, on a previous page, that in the creation of surplus value it does not in the least matter, whether the labour appropriated by the capitalist be simple unskilled labour of average quality or more complicated unskilled labour. All labour of a higher or m ore complicated character than average labour is expenditure of labour-power of a more costly kind, labour-power whose production has cost more time and labour, and which therefore has a higher value, than unskilled or simple labour-power. This power being of higher value, its consumption is labour of a higher class, labour that creates in equal time’s proportionally higher values than unskilled labour does. Whatever difference in skill there may be between the labour of a spinner and that of a jeweller, the portion of his labour by which the jeweller merely replaces the value of his own labourpower, does not in any way differ in quality from the additional portion by which he creates surplus-value. In the making of jewellery, just as in spinning, the surplus-value results only from a quantitative excess of labour, from a lengthening-out of one and the same labour-process, in the one case, of the process of making jewels, in the other of the process of making yarn .

        But on the other hand, in every process of creating value, the reduction of skilled labour to average social labour, e.g., one day of skilled to six days of unskilled labour, is unavoidable. We therefore save ourselves a superfluous operation, and simplify our analysis, by the assumption, that the labour of the workman employed by the capitalist is unskilled average labour. * * *

                                 CHAPTER X THE WORKING-DAY

                          Section 1. The Limits of the Working-Day

        We started with the supposition that labour-power is bought and sold at its value. Its value, like that of all other commodities, is determined by the working-time necessary to its production. If the production of the average daily means of subsistence of the labourer takes up 6 hours, he must work, on the average, 6 hours every day, to produce his daily labour-power, or to reproduce the value received as the result of its sale. The necessary part of his working-day amounts to 6 hours, and is, therefore, caeteris paribus, a given quantity. But with this, the extent of the working-day itself is not yet given.

        Let us assume that the line A B represents the length of the necessary working-time, say 6 hours. If the l abour be prolonged 1, 3, or 6 hours beyond A B, we have 3 other lines: Working day I. A -- B - C. Working day II. A--B – C. Working day III. A-- B –C, representing 3 different working-days of 7, 9, and 1 2 hours. The extension B C of the line A B represents the length of the surplus-labour. As the working-day is A B + B or A C, it varies with the variable quantity B C. Since A B is constant, the ratio of B C to A B can always b e calculated. In working-day I, it is 1/6, in working-day II, 3/6, in working-day III, 6/6 o f A B. Since, further, the ratio   determines the rate of the surplus-value the latter is given by the ratio of B C to A B. It amounts in the 3 different working-days respectively to 16 2/3, 50 and 100 per cent. On the other hand, the rate of surplus-value alone would not give us the extent of the working-day. If this rate, e.g., were 100 per cent, the working-day might be of 8, 10, 12, or more hours. It would indicate that the 2 constituent parts of the working-day, necessary-labour and surplus-labour time, were equal in extent, but not how long each of these two constituent parts was.

        The working-day is thus not a constant, but a variable quantity. One of its parts, certainly, is determined by the working-time required for the reproduction of the labour-power of the labourer himself. But its total amount varies with the duration of the surplus-labour. The working-day is, therefore, determinable, but is, per se, indeterminate.

        Although the working-day is not a fixed, but a fluent quantity, it can, on the other hand, only vary within certain limits. The minimum limit is, however, not determinable; of course, if we make the extension line B C or the surplus-labour= a, we have a minimum limit, i.e., the part of the day which the labourer must necessarily work for his own maintenance. On the basis of capitalist production, however, this necessary labour can form a part only of the working-day; the working-day itself can never be reduced to' this minimum. On the other h and, the working-day has a maximum limit. It cannot be prolonged beyond a certain point. This maximum limit is conditioned by two things. First, by the physical bounds of labour-power Within the 24 hours of the natural day a man can expend only a definite quantity of his vital force. A horse, in like manner, can only work from day to day, 8 hours. During part of the day this force must rest, sleep; during another part the man has to satisfy other physical needs, to feed, wash, and clothe himself. Besides these purely physical limitations, the extension of the working-day encounters moral ones. The labourer needs time for satisfying his intellectual and social wants, the extent and number of which are conditioned by the general state of social advancement. The variation of the working-day fluctuates, therefore, within physical and social bounds. But both these limiting conditions are of a very elastic nature, and allow the greatest latitude, So we find working-days of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 hours, i.e., of the most different lengths.

        The capitalist has bought the labour-power at its day-rate. To him it s use-value belongs during one working-day. He has thus acquired the right to make the labourer work for him during one day. But, what is a working-day?

        At all events less, than a natural day, By how much? The capitalist has his own views of this ultima Thule, the necessary limit of the working-day. As capitalist, he is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital. But capital has one single life impulse, the tendency to create value and surplus-value, to make its constant factor, the means of production, absorb the greatest possible amount of surplus-labour.

        Capital is dead labour, that, vampire-like, only lives by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks. The time during which the labourer works, is the time during which the capitalist consu mes the labour-power he has purchased of him.

        If the labourer consumes his disposable time for himself, he robs the capitalist.

        The capitalist then takes his stand on the law of the exchange of commodities. He, like all other buyers, seeks to get the greatest possible benefit out of the use-value of his commodity. Suddenly the voice of the labourer, which had been stifled in the storm and stress of the process of production, rises:

        The commodity that I have sold to you differs from the crowd of other commodities, in that its use creates value and a value greater than its own. That is why you bought it. That, which on your side appears a spontaneous expansion of capital, is on mine extra expenditure of labour-power. You and I know on the market only one law, that of the exchange of commodities. And the consumption of the commodity belongs not to the seller who parts with it, but to the buyer, who acquires it. To you, therefore, belongs the use of my daily labour-power. But by means of the price that you pay for it each day, I must be able to reproduce it daily, and to sell it again. Apart from natural exhaustion through age, &c, I must be able on the morrow to work with the same normal amount of force, health and freshness as to-day. You preach to me constantly the gospel of ""saving"" and ""abstinence."" Good! I will, like a sensible saving owner, husband my sale wealth, labour-power, and abstain from all foolish waste of it. I will each day spend, set in motion, put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration, and healthy development. By an unlimited extension of the working-day, you may in one day use up a quantity of labourpower greater than I can restore in three. What you gain in labour I lose in substance. The use of my labour-power and the spoliation of it are quite different things. If the average time that (doing a reasonable amount of work) an average labourer can live, is 30 years, the value of my labour-power, which you pay me from day to day is  or  of its total value. But if you consume it in 10 years, you pay me daily  instead of  of its total value, i.e., only 1/3 of its daily value, and you rob me, therefore, every day of 2/3 of the value of my commodity. You pay me for one day's labour-power, whilst you use that of 3 days. That is against our contract and the law of exchanges. I demand, therefore, a working- day of normal length, and I demand it without any appeal to your heart, for in money matters sentiment is out of place. You may be a model citizen perhaps a member of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and in the odour of sanctity to boot; but the thing that you represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast. That which seems to throb there is my own heart-beating. I demand the normal working-day because I, like every other seller, demand the value of my commodity.

        We see then, that, apart from extremely elastic bounds, the nature of the exchange of commodities itself imposes no limit to the working-day, no limit to surplus-labour. The capitalist maintains his rights as a purchaser when he tries to make the working- day as long as possible, and to make, whenever possible, two working-days out of one. On the other hand, the peculiar nature of the commodity sold implies a limit to its consumption by the purchaser, and the labourer maintains his right as seller when he wishes to reduce the working-day to one of definite normal duration. There is here, therefore, an antinomy, right against right, both equally bearing the seal of the law of exchanges. Between equal rights force decides. Hence is it that in the history of capitalist production, the determination of what is a working-day, presents itself as the result of a struggle, a struggle between collective capital, i.e., the class of capitalists, and collective labour, i.e., the working- class.

         Section 2. The Greed for Surplus-Labour. Manufacturer and Boyard

        Capital has not invented surplus-labour. Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production, the labourer, free or not free, must add to the working-time necessary for his own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production, whether this proprietor be the Athenian nobleman, Etruscan theocrat, civis Roman us, Norman baron, American slave-owner, Wallachian Boyard, modern landlord or capitalist. It is however, clear that in any given economic formation of society, where not the exchange-value but the use-value of the product predominates, surplus-labour will be limited by a given set of wants which may be greater or less, and that here no boundless thirst for surplus-labour arises from the nature of the production itself. Hence in antiquity over-work becomes horrible only when the object is to obtain exchange-value in its specific independent money-form; in the production of gold and silver. Compulsory working to death is here the recognised form of over-work. Only read Diodorus Siculus. Still these are exceptions in antiquity. But as soon as people, whose production still moves within the lower forms of slave-labour, corvee-labour, &c., are drawn into the whirlpool of an international market dominated by the capitalistic mode of production, the s ale of their products for export becoming their principal interest, the civilised horrors of over-work are grafted on the barbaric horrors of slavery, serfdom, &c. Hence the negro labour in the Southern States of the American Union preserved something of a patriarchal character, so long as production was chiefly directed to immediate local consumption But in proportion, as the export of cotton became of vital interest to these states, the over-working of the negro and sometimes the using up of his life in 7 years of labour became a factor in a calculated and calculating system. It was no longer a question of obtaining from him a certain quantity of useful products; it was now a question of production of surplus-labour itself. So was it also with the corvee, e.g., in the Danubian Principalities (now Roumania).

        The comparison of the greed for surplus-labour in the Danubian Principalities with the same greed in English factories has a special interest, because surplus-labour in the corvee has an independent and palpable form.

        Suppose the working-day consists of 6 hours of necessary labour, and 6 hours of surplus-labour. Then the free labourer gives the capitalist every week 6 X 6 or 36 hours of surplus-labour. It is the same as if he worked 3 days in the week for himself, and 3 days in the week gratis for the capitalist. But this is not evident on the surface. Surplus-labour and necessary labour glide one into the other. I can, therefore, express the same relationship by saying, e.g., that the labourer in every minute works 30 seconds for himself, and 30 for the capitalist, etc. It is otherwise with the corvee. The necessary labour which the Wallachian peasant does for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from his surplus-labour on behalf of the Boyard. The one he does on his own field, the other on the seignorial estate. Both parts of the labour-time exist, therefore, independently, side by side one with the other. In the corvee the surplus-labour is accurately marked off from the necessary labour. This, however, can make no difference with regard to the quantitative relation of surplus-labour to necessary labour. Three days' surplus-labour in the week remains three days that yield no equivalent to the labourer himself, whether it is called corvee or wage-labour. But in the capitalist the greed for surplus-labour appears in the straining after an unlimited extension of the working-day, in the Boyard more simply in a direct hunting after days of corvee.***

        The Factory Act of 1850 now in force (1867) allows for the average working-day 10 hours, i.e., for the first 5 days 12 hours from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., including 1/2 an hour for breakfast, and an h our for dinner, and thus leaving 10 1/2 working-hours, and 8 hours for Saturday, from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., of which 1/2 an hour is subtracted for breakfast. 60 working-hours are left, 10 1/2 for each of the first 5 days, 7 1/2 for the last. Certain guardians of these laws are appointed, Factory Inspectors, directly under the Home Secretary, whose reports are published half-yearly, by order of Parliament. They give regular and official statistics of the capitalistic greed for surplus-labour.

        Let us listen, for a moment, to the Factory Inspectors. ""The fraudulent mill-owner begins work a quarter of an hour (sometimes more, sometimes less) before 6 a.m., and leaves off a quarter of an hour (sometimes more, sometimes less) after 6 p.m. He takes 5 minutes from the beginning and from the end of the half hour nominally allowed for breakfast, and 10 minutes a t the beginning and end o f the hour nominally allowed for dinner. He works for a quarter of an hour (sometimes more, sometimes less) after 2 p.m. on Saturday. Thus his gain is

    Before 6 a.m.........................................................15 minutes
    After 6 p.m.,..........................................................15 minutes.
    At breakfast time, ................................................10 minutes.
    At dinner time,......................................................10 minutes.

                                Five days-300 minutes,            60 minutes.

    On Saturday before 6 a.m...................................15 minutes.
    A t breakfast time,................................................10 minutes.
    After 2 p.m., ........................................................15 minutes.
                                                                                40 minutes.

    Total weekly, ....................................................340 minutes.

Or 5 hours and 40 minutes weekly, which multiplied by 50 working weeks in the year (allowing two for holidays and occasional stoppages) is equal to 27 working-days.""

       ""Five minutes a day's increased work, multiplied b y weeks, are equal to two and a half days of produce i n the year.""

       ""An additional hour a day gained by small installments before 6 a.m., after 6 p.m., and at the beginning and end of the times nominally fixed for meals, is nearly equivalent to working 13 months in the year."" * * *

        These "" small thefts"" of capital from the labourer's meal and recreation time, the factory inspectors also designate as ""petty pilfering of minutes,"" ""snatching a few minutes,"" or, as the labourers technically called them, ""nibbling and cribbling at meal-times.""

        It is evident that in this atmosphere the -formation of surplusvalue by surplus-labour, is no secret. ""If you allow me,"" said a highly respectable master to me, ""to work only ten minutes in the day over-time, you put one thousand a year in my pocket."" ""Moments are the elements of profit.""

        Nothing is from this point of view more characteristic than the designation of the workers who work full time as ""full-timers,"" and the children under 13 who are only allowed to work 6 hours as ""half-timers . "" The worker is here nothing more than personified labour-time. All individual distinctions are merged in those of ""full-timers"" and ""half-timers.""

   Section 3. Branches of English Industry Without Legal Limits to Exploitation

        We have hitherto considered the tendency to the extension of the working-day, the were-woIf's hunger for surplus-labour in a department where the monstrous exactions, not surpassed, says an English bourgeois economist, by the cruelties of the Spaniards to the American red skins, caused capital at last to be bound by the chains of legal regulations. Now, let us cast a glance at certain branches of production in which the exploitation of labour is either free from fetters to this day, or was so yesterday.

        Mr. Broughton Charlton, county magistrate, declared, as chairman of a meeting held at the Assembly Rooms, Nottingham, on the 14th of January, 1860, ""that there was an amount of privation and suffering among that portion of the population connected with the lace trade, unknown in other parts of the kingdom, indeed, in the civilised world . . . . Children of nine or ten years are dragged from their squalid beds at two, three, or four O' clock in the morning and compelled to work for a bare subsistence until ten, eleven, or twelve at night, their limbs wearing away, their frames dwindling, their faces whitening, and their humanity absolutely sinking into a stone-like torpor, utterly horrible to contemplate . . . . We are not surprised that Mr. Mallett, or any other manufacturer, should stand forward and protest against discussion . . . . The system, as the Rev. Montagu Valpy describes it, is one of unmitigated slavery, socially, physically, morally, and spiritually . . . . What can be thought of a town which holds a public meeting to petition that the period of labour for men shall be diminished to eighteen hours a day? . . . We declaim against the Virginian and Carolinian cotton- planters. Is their black-market, their lash, and their barter of human flesh more detestable than this slow sacrifice of humanity which takes place in order that veils and collars may be fabricated for the benefit of capitalists?"" * * *

        The manufacture of lucifer matches dates from 1833, from the discovery of the method of applying phosphorus to the match itself. Since 184 5 this manufacture has rapidly developed in England, and has extended especially amongst the thickly populated parts o f London as well as in Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Bristol, Norwich, Newcastle and Glasgow. With it has spread the form of lockjaw, which a Vienna physician in 1845 discovered to be a disease peculiar to lucifer-matchmakers. Half the workers are children under thirteen, and young persons under eighteen. The manufacture is on account of its unhealthiness and unpleasantness in such bad odour that only the most miserable part of the laboring class, half-starved widows and so forth, deliver up their children to it, ""the ragged, half-starved, untaught children.""

        Of the witnesses that Commissioner White examined (1863), '270 were under 18, 50 under 10, 10 only 8, and 5 only 6 years old. A range of the working-day from 12 to 14 or 15 hours, night-labour, irregular meal-times, meals for the most part taken in the very workrooms those are pestilent with phosphorus. Dante would have found the worst horrors of his Inferno surpassed in this manufacture. * * *

        No branch of industry in England (we do not take into account the making of bread by machinery recently introduced) has preserved up to the present day a method o f production so archaic, so-as we see from the poets of the Roman Empire-pre-christian, as baking. But capital, as was said earlier, is at first indifferent as to the technical character of the labour-process; it begins by taking it just as it finds it.

        The incredible adulteration of bread, especially in London, was first revealed by the House of Commons Committee ""on the adulteration of articles of food"" (1855- 56), and Dr. Hassall's work, ""Adulterations detected."" The consequence of these revelations was the Act of August 6th, 1860, ""for preventing the adulteration of articles of food and drink,"" an inoperative law, as it naturally shows the tenderest consideration for every Free-trader who determines by the buying or selling of adulterated commodities "" to turn an honest penny. "" The Committee itself formulated more or less naively its conviction that Free-trade meant essentially trade with adulterated, or as the English ingeniously put it, ""sophisticated"" goods. In fact this kind of sophistry knows better than Protagoras how to make white black and black white, and better than the Eleatics how to demonstrate ad oculos that everything is only appearance.

        At all events the Committee had directed the attention of the public to its ""daily bread,"" and therefore to the baking trade. At the same time in public meetings and in petitions to Parliament rose the cry o f the London journeymen bakers against their overwork, &c. The cry was so urgent that Mr. H. S. Tremenheere, also a member of the Commission of 1863 several times mentioned, was appointed Royal Commissioner of Inquiry. His report, together with the evidence given, roused not the heart of the public but its stomach. Englishmen, always well up in the Bible, knew well enough that man, unless by elective grace a capitalist, or landlord, or sinecurist, is commanded to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow, but they did not know that he had to eat daily in his bread a certain quantity of human perspiration mixed with the discharge of abscesses, cobwebs, dead black-beetles, and putrid German yeast, without counting alum, sand, and other agreeable mineral ingredients. Without any regard to his holiness, Free-trade, the free baking- trade was therefore placed under the supervision of the State inspectors (Close of the Parliamentary session of 1863), and by the same Act of Parliament, work from 9 in the evening to 5 in the morning was forbidden for journeymen bakers under 18. The last clause speaks volumes as to the over-work in this old-fashioned, homely line of business.

        ""The work of a London journeyman baker begins, as a rule, at about eleven at night. At that hour he 'makes the dough, '-a laborious process, which lasts from half an hour to three quarters of an hour, according to the size of the batch or the labour bestowed upon it. He then lies down upon the kneading-board, which is also the covering of the trough in which the dough is 'made'; and with a sack under him, and another rolled up as a pillow, he sleeps for about a couple of hours. He is then engaged in a rapid and continuous labour for about five hours-throwing out the dough, 'scaling if off,' moulding it, putting it into the oven, preparing and baking rolls and fancy bread, taking the batch bread out of the oven, and up into the shop, &c., &c. The temperature of a bakehouse ranges from about 75 to upwards of 90 degrees, and in the smaller bakehouses approximates usually to the higher rather than to the lower degree of heat. When the business of making the bread, rolls, &c., is over, that of its distribution begins, and a considerable proportion of the journeymen in the trade, after working hard in the manner described during the night, are upon their legs for many hours during the day, carrying baskets, or wheeling hand-carts, and sometimes again in the bakehouse, leaving off work at various hours between 1 and 6 p.m. according to the season of the year, or the amount and nature of their master's business; while others are again engaged in the bakehouse in 'bringing out' more batches until late in the afternoon . . . . During what is called ' the London season,' the operatives belonging to the ' full-priced' bakers at the West End of the town, generally begin work at 11 p.m., and are engaged in making the bread, with one or two short ( sometimes very short ) intervals of rest, up to 8 o'clock the next morning. They are then engaged all day long, up to 4, 5, 6, and as late as 7 o'clock in the evening carrying out bread, or sometimes in the afternoon in the bakehouse again, assisting in the biscuit-baking. They may have, after they have done their work, sometimes five or six, sometimes only four or five hours' sleep before they begin again. On Fridays they always begin sooner, some about ten o'clock, and continue in some cases, at work, either in making or delivering the bread up to 8 p.m. on Saturday night, but more generally up to 4 or 5 o'clock, Sunday morning. On Sundays the men must attend twice or three times during the day for an hour or two to make preparations for the next day's bread . . . . The men employed by the underselling masters ( who sell their bread under the 'full price,' and who, as already pointed out, comprise three-fourths of the London bakers ) have not only to work on the average longer hours, but their work is almost entirely confined to the bakehouse. The underselling masters generally sell their bread . . . . In the shop, If they send it out, which is not common, except as supplying ' chandler's shops, they usually employ other hands for that purpose. It is not their practice to deliver bread from house to house. Towards the end of the week . . . the men begin on Thursday night at 10 o' clock, and continue on with only slight intermission until late on Saturday evening.""

        Even the bourgeois intellect understands the position of the ""underselling"" masters. ""The unpaid labour of the men was made the source whereby the competition was carried on."" And the ""full-priced"" baker denounces his underselling competitors to the Commission of Inquiry as thieves of foreign labour and adulterators. ""They only exist now by first defrauding the public and next getting 18 hours 'work out of their men for 12 hours’ wages.""

        The adulteration of bread and the formation of a class of bakers that sells the bread below the full price, date from the beginning of the 18th century, from the time when the corporate character of the trade was lost, and the capitalist in the form of the miller or flour-factor, rises behind the nominal master baker. Thus was laid the foundation of capitalistic production in this trade, of the unlimited extension of the working-day and of night-labour, although the latter only since 1824 gained a serious footing, even in London.

        After what has just been said, it will be understood that the Report of the Commission classes journeymen bakers among the short-lived labourers, who, having by good luck escaped the normal decimation of the children of the working-class, rarely reach the age of 42. Nevertheless, the baking trade is always overwhelmed with applicants. The sources of the supply of these labour-powers to London are Scotland, the western agricultural districts of England, and Germany. * * *

        From the motley crowd of labourers of all callings, ages, sexes, that press on us more busily than the souls of the slain on Ulysses, on whom-without referring to the Blue books under their arms-we see at a glance the mark of over-work, let us take two more figures whose striking contrast proves that before capital all men are alike-a milliner and a blacksmith.

        In the last week of June, 1863, all the London daily papers published a paragraph with the ""sensational"" heading, ""Death from simple over-work."" It dealt with the death of the milliner, Mary Anne Walkley, 20 years of age, employed in a highly respectable dressmaking establishment, exploited by a lady with the pleasant name of Elise. The old, often-told story was once more recounted. This girl worked, on an average, 16 1/2 hours, during the season often 30 hours, without a break, whilst her failing labourpower was revived by occasional supplies of sherry, port, or coffee. It was just now the height of the season. It was necessary to conjure up in the twinkling of an eye the gorgeous dresses for the noble ladies bidden to the ball in honour of the newly-imported Princess of Wales. Mary Anne Walkley had worked without intermission for 26 1/2 hours, with 60 other girls, 30 in one room that only afforded 1/3 of the cubic feet of air required for them. At night, they slept in pairs in one o f the stifling holes into which the bedroom was divided by partitions of board. And this was one of the best millinery establishments in London. Mary Anne Walkley fell ill on the Friday, died on Sunday, without, to the astonishment 6f Madame Elise, having previously completed the work in hand. The doctor, Mr. Keys, called too late to the death-bed, duly bore witness before the coroner's jury that ""Mary Anne Walkley had died from long hours of work in an over-crowded workroom, and a too small and badly-ventilated bedroom."" In order to give the doctor a lesson in good manners; the coroner's jury thereupon brought in a verdict that ""the deceased had died of apoplexy, but there was reason to fear that her death had been accelerated by over-work in an over-crowded workroom, &c."" ""Our white slaves,"" cried the Morning Star, the organ of the Free-traders, Cobden and. Bright, ""our white slaves, who are toiled into the grave, for the• most part silently pine and die.""

        ""It is not in dressmakers' rooms that working to death is the order of the day, but in a thousand other places; in every place I had almost said, where 'a thriving business' has to be done. We will take the blacksmith as a type. If the poets were true, there is no man so hearty, so merry, as the blacksmith; he rises early and strikes his sparks before the sun; he eats and drinks and sleeps as no other man. Working in moderation, he is, in fact, in one of the best of human positions, physically speaking. But we follow him into the city or town, and we see the stress of work on that strong man, and what then is his position in the death-rate of his country. In Marylebone, blacksmiths die at the rate of 31 per thousand per annum, or 11 above the mean of the male adults of the country in its entirety. The occupation, instinctive almost as a portion of human art, unobjectionable as a branch of human industry, is made by mere excess o f work, the destroyer of the man. He can strike so many blows per day, walk so many steps, breathe so many breaths, produce so much work, and live an average, say of fifty years; he is made to strike so many more blows, to walk so many more steps, to breathe so many more breaths per day, and to increase altogether a fourth of his life. He meets the effort; the result is that producing for a limited time a fourth more work, he dies at 37 for 50.""

                       Section 4. Day and Night Work. The Relay System

        Constant capital, the means of production, considered from the standpoint of the creation of surplus-value, only exist to absorb labour, and with every drop of labour a proportional quantity of surplus-labour. While they fail to do this, their mere existence causes a relative loss to the capitalist, for they represent during the time they lie fallow, a useless advance of capital. And this loss becomes positive and absolute as soon as the intermission of their employment necessitates additional outlay at the recommencement of work. The prolongation of the working-day beyond the limits of the natural day, into the night, only acts as a palliative. It quenches only in a slight degree the vampire thirst for the living blood of labour. To appropriate labour during all the 24 hours of the day is, therefore, the inherent tendency of capitalist production. But as it is physically impossible to exploit the same individual labour-power constantly during the night as well as the day, to overcome this physical hindrance, an alternation becomes necessary between the workpeople whose powers are exhausted by day, and those who are used up by night. This alternation may be effected in various ways; e.g., it may be so arranged that part of the workers are one week employed on day-work, the next week on night-work. It is well known that this relay system, this alternation of two sets of workers, held full sway in the full-blooded youth-time of the English cotton manufacture, and that at the present time it still flourishes, among others, in the cotton spinning of the Moscow district. This 24 hours' process of production exists to-day as a system in many of the branches of industry of Great Britain that are still ""free,"" in the blast-furnaces, forges, plate-rolling mills, and other metallurgical establishments in England, Wales, and Scotland. The working-time here includes, besides the 24 hours of the 6 working-days, a great part also of the 24 hours of Sunday. The workers consist of men and women, adults and children of both sexes. The ages of the children and young persons run through all intermediate grades, from 8 (in some cases from 6) to 18. In some branches a f indus try, the girls and women work through the night together with the males. * * *

Section 5. The Struggle for a Normal Working-Day. Compulsory Laws for the Extension of the Working-Day from the Middle of the 14th to the End of the 17th
                                                     Century

        ""What is a working-day? What is the length of time during which capital may consume the labour-power whose daily value it buys? How far may the working-day be extended beyond the working-time necessary for the reproduction of labour-power itself?"" It has been seen that to these questions capital replies: the working-day contains the full 24 hours, with the deduction of the few hours of repose without which labour-power absolutely refuses its services again. Hence it is self-evident that the labourer is nothing else, his whole life through, than labour-pow.er, that therefore all his disposable time is by nature and law labour-time, to be devoted to the self-expansion of capital, Time for education, for intellectual development, for the fulfilling of social functions and for social intercourse for the free-play of his bodily and mental activity, even the rest time of Sunday (and that in a country of Sabbatarians!) -moonshine! But in its blind unrestrainable passion, its were-wolf hunger for surplus-labour, capital overst.eps not only the moral, but even the merely physical maximum bounds of the working-day. It usurps the time for growth, development, and healthy maintenance o f the body. It steals the time required for the consumption of fresh air and sunlight. It higgles over a meal-time, incorporating it where possible with the process of production itself, so that food is given to the labourer as to a mere means of production, as coal is supplied to the boiler, grease and oil to the machinery. It reduces the sound sleep needed for the restoration, reparation, refreshment of the bodily powers to just so many hours of torpor as the revival of an organism, absolutely exhausted, renders essential. It is not the normal maintenance of the labour-power which is to determine the limits of the working-day; it is the greatest possible daily expenditure of labour-power, no matter how diseased, compulsory, and painful it may be, which is to determine the limits of the labourers' period of repose. Capital cares nothing for the length of life of labour-power. All that concerns it is simply and solely the maximum of labour-power that can be rendered fluent in a working-day. It attains this end by shortening the extent of the labourer's life, as a greedy farmer snatches increased produce from the soil by robbing it of its fertility.

        The capitalistic mode of production (essentially the production of surplus-value, the absorption of surplus-labour), produces thus, with the extension of the working-day, not only the deterioration of human labour-power by robbing it of its normal, moral and physical, conditions of development and function. It produces also the premature exhaustion and death of this lab our-power itself. It extends the labourer's time of production during a given period by shortening his actual life-time.

        But the value of the labour-power includes the value of the commodities necessary for the reproduction of the worker, or for the keeping up of the working-class. If then the unnatural extension of the working-day, that capital necessarily strives after in its unmeasured passion for self-expansion, shortens the length of life of the individual labourer, and therefore the duration of his labour-power, the forces used up have to be replaced at a more rapid rate and the sum of the expenses for the reproduction of labour-power will be greater; just as in a machine the part of its value to be reproduced every day is greater the more rapidly the machine is worn out. It would seem therefore that the interest of capital itself points in the direction of a normal working-day.

        The slave-owner buys his labourer as he buys his horse. If heloses his slave, he loses capital that can only be restored by new outlay in the slave-mart. But ""the rice-grounds of Georgia, or the swamps of the Mississippi may be fatally injurious to the human constitution; but the waste of human life which the cultivation of these districts necessitates, is not so great that it cannot be repaired from the teeming preserves of Virginia and Kentucky. Considerations of economy, moreover, which, under a natural system, afford some security for human treatment by identifying the master's interest with the slave's preservation, when once trading in slaves is practised, become reasons for racking to the uttermost the toil of the slave; for, when his place can at once be supplied from foreign preserves, the duration of his life becomes a matter of less moment than its productiveness while it lasts. It is accordingly a maxim of slave management, in slave-importing countries, that the most effective economy is that which takes out of the human chattel in the shortest space of time the utmost amount of exertion it is capable of putting forth. It is in tropical culture, where annual profits often equal the whole capital of plantations, that Negro life is most recklessly sacrificed. It is the agriculture of the West Indies, which has been for centuries prolific of fabulous wealth that has engulfed millions of the African race. It is in Cuba, at this day, whose revenues are reckoned by millions, and whose planters are princes, that we see in the servile class, the coarsest fare, the most exhausting and unremitting toil, and even the absolute destruction of a portion of its numbers every year.""

        Mutato nomine de te fabula narrator.  For slave-trade read labour-market, for Kentucky and Virginia, Ireland and the agricultural districts of England, Scotland, and Wales, for Africa, Germany. We heard how over-work thinned the ranks of the bakers in London. Nevertheless, the London labour-market is always overstocked with German and other candidates for death in the bakeries. Pottery, as we saw, is one of the shortest-lived industries. Is there any want therefore of potters? Josiah Wedgwood, the inventor of modern pottery, himself originally a common workman, said in 1785 before the House of Commons that the whole trade employed from 15,000 to 20,000 people. In the year 1861 the population alone of the town centres of this industry in Great Britain numbered 101, 302. ""The cotton trade has existed for ninety years . . . . I t has existed for three generations of the English race, and I believe I may safely say that during that period it has destroyed nine generations o f factory operatives."" * * *

        What experience shows to the capitalist generally is a constant excess of population, i.e., an excess in relation to the momentary requirements of surplus-lab our-absorbing capital, although this excess is made up o f generations of human beings stunted, shortlived, swiftly replacing each other, plucked, so to say, before maturity. And, indeed, experience shows to the intelligent observer with what swiftness and grip the capitalist m ode of production, dating, historically speaking, only from yesterday, has seized the vital power of the people by the very root-shows how the degeneration of the industrial population is only retarded by the constant absorption of primitive and physically uncorrupted elements from the country shows how even the country labourers, in spite of fresh air and the principle of natural selection, that works so powerfully amongst them, and only permits the survival of the strongest, are already beginning to die off. Capital that has such good reasons for denying the sufferings of the legions of workers that surround it, is in practice moved as much and as little by the sight of the coming degradation and final depopulation of the human race, as by the probable fall of the earth into the sun. In every stock-jobbing swindle every one knows that some time or other the crash must come, but every one hope that it may fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself has caught the shower of gold and placed it in safety. Apres moi Ie deluge! is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation. Hence Capital is reckless o f the health or length of life of the labourer, unless under compulsion from society.

        To the out cry as to the physical and mental degradation, the premature death, the torture of over-work, it answers: Ought these to trouble us since they increase our profits? But looking at things as a whole, all this does not, indeed, depend on the good or ill will of the individual capitalist. Free competition brings out the inherent laws of capitalist production, in the shape of external coercive laws having power over every individual capitalist. The establishment of a normal working-day is the result of centuries of struggle between capitalist and labourer. The history of this struggle shows two opposed tendencies. Compare, e.g., the English factory legislation of our time with the English Labour Statutes from the 14th century to when into the middle of the 18th.Whilst the modern Factory Acts compulsorily shortened the working-day, the earlier statutes tried to lengthen it by compulsion. Of course the pretensions of capital in embryo-when, beginning to grow, it secures the right of absorbing a quantum sufficit of surplus-labour, not merely by the force of economic relations, but by the help of the State-appear very modest when put face to face with the concessions that, growling and struggling, it has to make in its adult condition. It takes centuries ere the ""free"" labourer, thanks to the development of capitalistic production, agrees, i.e., is compelled by social conditions, to sell the 'Whole of his active life, his very capacity for work, for the price of the necessaries of life, his birthright for a mess of pottage. Hence it is natural that the lengthening of the work-day, which capital, 'from the middle of the 14th to the end of the 17th century, tries to impose by State measures on adult labourers, approximately coincides with the shortening of the working-day which, in the second half of the19th century, has here and there been effected by the State to prevent the coining of children's blood into capital. That which to-day, e.g., in the State of Massachusetts, until recently the freest State of the North-American Republic, has been proclaimed a s the statutory limit of the labour of children under 12, was in England, even in the middle of the 17th century, the normal working-day of ablebodiedartisans, robust labourers, athletic blacksmiths. * * *

                       Part IV. Production of Relative Surplus-Value
         CHAPTER XII. THE CONCEPT OF RELATIVE SURPLUSVALUE

        That portion of the working-day which merely produces an equivalent for the value paid by the capitalist for h is labour-power, has, up to this point, been treated by us as a constant magnitude, and such in fact it is, under given conditions of production and at a given stage in the economic development of society. Beyond this his necessary labour-time, the labourer, we saw, could continue to work for 2, 3, 4, 6, &c., hours. The rate of surplus-value and the length of the working-day depended on the magnitude of this prolongation though the necessary labour-time was constant, we saw, on the other hand that the total working-day was variable. Now suppose we have a working-day whose length, and whose apportionment between necessary labour and surplus-labour, are given. Let the whole line a c, a---b-c represent, for example, a working-day of 12 hours; the portion of a b 10 hours of necessary labour, and the portion b c 2 hours of surplus-labour. How now can the production of surplus-value be increased, i.e., how can the surplus- labour be prolonged, without, or independently of, any prolongation of a c?

        Although the length of a c is given, b c appears to be capable of prolongation, if not by extension beyond its end c, which is also the end of the working-day a c, yet, at all events, by pushing back its starting-point b in the direction of a. Assume that b'-b in the line a b' b c is equal to half of b c a                              b’         b               c
or to one hour's labour-time. If now, in a c, the working-day of 12hours, we move the point b to b', b c becomes b' c; the surpluslabour increases b y one half, from 2 hours to 3 hours, although the working-day remains as before at 12 hours. This extension of the surplus labour-time from b c to b' c, from 2 hours to 3 h ours, is, however, evidently impossible, without a simultaneous contraction of the necessary labour-time from a b into a b', from 10 hours to 9 hours. The prolongation of the surplus-labour would correspond to a shortening of the necessary labour; or a portion of the labour-time previously consumed, in reality, for the labourer's own benefit, would be converted into labour-time for the benefit of the capitalist. There would be an alteration, not in the length of the working-day, but in its division into necessary labour-time and surplus labour-time.

        On the other hand, it is evident that the duration of the surplus- labour is given, when the length of the working-day, and the value of labour-power, are given. The value of labour-power, i.e., the labour-time requisite to produce labour-power, determines the labour-time necessary for the reproduction o f that value. If one working-hour be embodied in sixpence, and the value of a day's labour-power be five shillings, the labourer must work 10 hours a day, in order to replace the value paid by capital for his labourpower, or to produce an equivalent for the value of his daily necessary means of subsistence. Given the value of these means of subsistence, the value of his labour-power is given; and given the value of his labour-power, the duration of his necessary labour-time is given. The duration of the surplus-labour, however, is arrived at, by subtracting the necessary labour-time from the total working-day. Ten hours subtracted from twelve, leave two, and it is not easy to see, how, under the given conditions, the surplus-labour can possibly be prolonged beyond two hours. No doubt, the capitalist can, instead of five shillings, pay the labourer four shillings and sixpence or even less. For the reproduction of this value of four shillings and sixpence, nine hours' labour-time would suffice; and consequently three hours of surplus-labour, instead of two, would accrue to the capitalist, and the surplus-value would rise from one shilling to eighteen pence. This result, however, would be obtained only by lowering the wages of the labourer below the value of his labourpower. With the four shillings and sixpence which he produces in nine hours, he commands one-tenth less of the necessaries of life than before, and consequently the proper reproduction of his labour-power is crippled. The surplus-labour would in this case be prolonged only by an overstepping of its normal limits; its domain would be extended only by a usurpation of part of the domain of necessary labour-time. Despite the important part which this method plays in actual practice, we are excluded from considering it in this place, by our assumption, that all commodities, including labour-power, are bought and sold at their full value. Granted this, it follows that the labour-time necessary 'for the production of labour-power, or for the reproduction of its value, cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourer's wages below the value of his labour-power, but only by a fall in this value itself. Given the length of the working-day, the prolongation of the surplus-labour must of necessity originate in the curtailment of the necessary labour-time; the latter cannot arise from the former. In the example we have taken, it is necessary that the value of labour-power should actually fall by one-tenth, in order that the necessary labour-time may be diminished by one-tenth, i.e., from ten h ours to nine, and in order that the surplus-labour may consequently be prolonged from two hours to three.

        Such a fall in the value of labour-power implies, however; that the same necessaries of life which w ere formerly produced in ten hours, can now be produced in nine hours. But this is impossible without an increase in the productiveness of labour. For example, suppose a shoemaker, with given tools, makes in one working-day of twelve hours, one pair of boots. If he must make two pairs in the same time, the productiveness of his labour must be doubled; and this can not be done, except by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working, or in both. Hence, the conditions of production, i.e., his mode of production, and the labour-process itself, must be revolutionised. By increase in the productiveness of labour, we mean, generally, an alteration in the labour-process, of such a kind as to shorten the labour-time socially necessary for the production of a commodity, and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of use-value. Hitherto in treating of surplus-value, arising from a simple prolongation of the working-day, we have assumed the mode of production to be given and invariable. But when surplus-value has to be produced by the conversion of necessary labour into surplus-labour, it by no means suffices for capital to take over the labour-process in the form under which it has been historically handed down and then simply to prolong the duration of that process. The technical and social conditions of the process, and consequently the very mode of production must be revolutionised, before the productiveness of labour can be increased. By that means alone can the value of labourpower be made to sink, and the portion of the working-day necessary for the reproduction of that value, be shortened.

        The surplus-value produced by prolongation of the working-day, I call absolute surplus-value. On the other hand, the surplus-value arising from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the working-day, I call relative surplus-value.

        In order to effect a fall in the value of labour-power, the increase in the productiveness of labour must seize upon those branches of industry, whose products determine the value of labour-power, and consequently either belong to the class of customary means of subsistence, or are capable of supplying the place of those means. But the value of a commodity is determined, not only by the quantity of labour which the labourer directly bestows upon that commodity, but also by the labour contained in the means of production .For instance, the value of a p air of boots depends, not only on the cobbler's labour, but also on the value of the leather, wax, thread, &c. Hence, a fall in the value of labour-power is also brought about by an increase in the productiveness of labour, and by a corresponding cheapening of commodities in those industries which supply the instruments of labour and the raw material, that form the material elements of the constant capital required for producing the necessaries of life. But an increase in the productiveness of labour in those branches of industry which supply neither the necessaries of life, nor the means of production for such necessaries, leaves the value of labour-power undisturbed.

        The cheapened commodity, of course, causes only a pro tanto fall in the value of labour-power, a fall proportional to the extent of that commodity employment in the reproduction of labour-power. Shirts, for instance, are a necessary means of subsistence, but are only one out of many. The totality of the necessaries of life consists, however, of various commodities, each the product of a distinct industry; and the value of each of those commodities enter as a component part into the value of labour-power. This latter value decreases with the decrease of the labour-time necessary for its reproduction; the total decrease being the sum of all the different curtailments of labour-time effected in those various and distinct industries. This general result is treated, here, as if it were the immediate result directly aimed at in each individual case. Whenever an individual capitalist cheapens shirts, for instance, by increasing the productiveness of labour, he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the value of labour-power and shortening, pro tanto, the necessary labour-time. But it is only in so far as he ultimately contribtites to this result that he assists in raising the general rate of surplus-value. The general and necessary tendencies of capital must be distinguished from their forms of manifestation.

        It is not our intention to consider, here, the way in which the laws, immanent in capitalist production, manifest themselves in the movements of individual masses of capital, where they assert themselves as coercive laws of competition, and are brought home to the mind and consciousness of the individual capitalist as the directing motives of his operations. But this much is clear; a scientific analysis of competition is not possible, before we have a conception of the inner nature of capital, just as the apparent motions of the heavenly bodies are not intelligible to any but him, who is acquainted with their real motions, motions which are not directly perceptible by the senses. Nevertheless, for the better comprehension of the production of relative surplus-value, we may add the following remarks, in which we assume nothing more than the results we have already obtained.

        If one hour's labour is embodied in sixpence, a value of six shillings will be produced in a working-day of 12 hours. Suppose that with the prevailing productiveness of labour, 12 articles are produced in these 12 hours. Let the value of the means of production used up in each article be sixpence. Under these circumstances, each article costs one shilling: sixpence for the value of the means of production, and sixpence for the value newly added in working with those means. Now let some one capitalist contrive to double the productiveness of labour, and to produce in the working-day of 12 hours, 24 instead of 12 such articles. The value of the means of production remaining the same, the value of each article will fall to nine pence, made up of sixpence for the value of the means of production and three pence for the value newly added by the labour. Despite the doubled productiveness of labour, the day's labour creates, as before, a new value of six shillings and no more, which, however, is now spread over twice as many articles. Of this value each article now has embodied in it 1/24th, instead of 1/12th, three-pence instead of sixpence; or, what amounts to the same thing, only half an hour's instead of a whole hour's labour-time, is now added to the means of production while they are being transformed into each article. The individual value of these articles is now below their social value; in other words, they have cost less labourtime than the great bulk of the same article produced under the average social conditions. Each article costs, on an average, one shilling, and represents 2 hours of social labour; but under the altered mode of production it costs only nine pence, or contains only 1 1/2 hours' labour. The real value of a commodity is, however, not its individual value, but its social value; that is to say, the real value is not measured by the labour-time that the article in each individual case costs the producer, but by the labour-time socially required for its production. If therefore, the capitalist who applies the new method, sells his commodity at its social value of one shilling, he sells it for three pence above its individual value, and thus realises an extra surplus-value of three pence. On the other hand, the working-day of 12 hours is, as regards him, now represented by 24 articles instead of 12. Hence, in order to get rid of the product of one working-day, the demand must be double what it was, i.e., the market must become twice as extensive. Other things being equal, his commodities can command a more extended market only by a diminution of their prices. He will therefore sell them above their individual but under their social value, say at ten pence each .By this means he still squeezes an extra surplus-value of one penny out of each. This augmentation of surplus-value is pocketed by him, whether his commodities belong or not to the class of necessary means of subsistence that participate in determining the general value of labour-power. Hence, independently of this latter circumstance, there is a motive for each individual capitalist to cheapen his commodities, by increasing the productiveness of labour.

        Nevertheless, even in this case, the increased production of surplus- value arises from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the corresponding prolongation of the surplus-labour. Let the necessary labour-time a mount to 10 hours, the value of a day's labour-power to five shillings, the surplus labour-time to 2 hours, and the daily surplus-value to one shilling. But the capitalist now produces 24 articles, which he sells at ten pence a-piece, making twenty shillings in all. Since the value of the means of production is twelve shillings, 14 2/5 of these articles merely rep lace the constant capital advanced. The labour of the 12 hours' working-day is represented by the remaining 9 3/5 articles. Since the price of the labour-power is five shillings, 6 articles represent the necessary labour-time, and 3 3/5 articles the surplus-labour. The ratio of the necessary labour to the surplus-labour, which under average social conditions was 5:1, is now only 5:3. The same result may be arrived at in the following way. The value of the product of the working-day of 12 hours is twenty shillings. Of this sum, twelve shillings belong to the value of the means of production, a value that merely re-appears. There remain eight shillings, which are the expression in money, of the value newly created during the working- day. This sum is greater than the sum in which average social labour of the same kind is expressed: twelve hours of the latter labour are expressed by six shillings only. The exceptionally productive labour operates as intensified labour; it creates in equal periods of time greater values than average social labour of the same kind. But our capitalist still continues to pay as before only five shillings as the value of a day's labour-power. Hence, instead of 10 hours, the labourer need now work only 7 4/5 hours, in order to reproduce this value. His surplus-labour is, therefore, increased by 2 4/5 hours, and the surplus-value he produces grows from one, into three shillings. Hence, the capitalist who applies the improved method of production, appropriates to surplus-labour a greater portion of the working-day, than the other capitalists in the same trade. He does individually, what the whole body of capitalists engaged in producing relative surplus-value, do collectively. On the other hand, however, this extra surplus-value vanishes, as soon as the new method of production has become general, and has consequently caused the difference between the individual value of the cheapened commodity and its social value to vanish. The law of the determination of value by labour-time, a law which brings under its sway the individual capitalist who applies the new method of production, by compelling him to sell his goods under their social value, this same law, acting as a coercive law of competition, forces his competitors to adopt the new method. The general rate of surplus-value is, therefore, ultimately affected by the whole process, only when the increase in the productiveness of labour, has seized upon those branches of production that are connected with, and has cheapened those commodities that form part of, the necessary means of subsistence, and are therefore elements of the value of labour-power.

        The value of commodities is in inverse ratio to the productiveness of labour. And so, too, is the value of labour-power, because it depends on the values of commodities. Relative surplus-value is, on the contrary, directly proportional to that productiveness. It rises with rising and falls with falling productiveness. The value of money being assumed to be constant, an average social working-day of 12 hours always produces the same new value, six shillings, no matter how this sum may be apportioned between surplus-value and wages. But if, in consequence of increased productiveness, the value of the necessaries of life fall, and the value of a day's labour-power be thereby reduced from five shillings to three, the surplus-value increases from one shilling to three. Ten hours were necessary for the reproduction of the value of the labour-power; now only six are required. Four hours have been set free, and can be annexed to the domain of surplus-labour. Hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency, to heighten the productiveness of labour, in order to cheapen commodities, and by such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself.

        The value of a commodity is, in itself, of no interest to the capitalist. What alone interests him, is the surplus-value that dwells in it, and is realisable by sale. Realisation of the surplus-value necessarily carries with it the refunding of the value that was advanced. Now, since relative surplus-value increases in direct proportion to the development o f the productiveness of labour, while, on the other hand, the value of commodities diminishes in the same proportion; since one and the same process cheapens commodities, and augments the surplus-value contained in them; we have here the solution of the riddle: why does the capitalist, whose sole concern is the production of exchange-value, continually strive to depress the exchange-value of commodities? A riddle with which Quesnay, one of the founders of Political Economy, tormented his opponents, and to which they could give him no answer. ""You acknowledge,"" He says, ""that the more expenses and the cost of labour can, in the manufacture of industrial products, be reduced without injury to production, the more advantageous is such reduction, because it diminishes the price of the finished article. And yet, you believe that the production of wealth, which arises from the labour of the workpeople, consists in the augmentation of the exchange"" value of their products.""

        The shortening of the working-day is, therefore, by no means what is aimed at, in capitalist production, when labour is economized by increasing its productiveness. It is only the shortening of the labour-time, necessary for the production of a definite quantity of commodities that is aimed at. The fact that the workman, when the productiveness of his labour has been increased, produces, say 10 times as many commodities as before, and thus spends one tenth as much labour-time on each, by no means prevents him from continuing to work 12 hours as before, nor from producing in those 12 hours 1,200 articles instead of 120. Nay, more, his working- day may be prolonged at the same time, so as to make him produce, say 1,400 articles in 14 hours. In the treatises, therefore, of economists of the stamp of MacCulloch, Ure, Senior, and tutti quanti, we may read upon one page, that the labourer owes a debt of gratitude to capital for developing his productiveness, because the necessary labour-time is thereby shortened, and on the next page, that h e must prove his gratitude by working in future for 15 hours instead o f 10. The object of all development of the productiveness of labour, within the limits of capitalist production, is to shorten that part of the working-day, during which the workman must labour for his own benefit, and by that very shortening, to lengthen the other part of the day, during which he is at liberty to work gratis for the capitalist. How far this result is also attainable, without cheapening commodities, will appear from an examination of the particular modes of producing relative surplus-value, to which examination we now proceed.

                                CHAPTER XIII. CO-OPERATION

        Capitalist production only then really begins, as we have already seen, when each individual capital employs simultaneously a comparatively large number of labourers; when consequently the labour-process is carried on on an extensive scale and yields, relatively, large quantities of products. A greater number of labourers working together, at the same time, in one place (or, if you will, in the same field of labour), in order to produce the same sort of commodity under the mastership of one capitalist, constitutes, both historically and logically, the starting-point of capitalist production. With regard to the mode of production itself, manufacture, in its strict meaning, is hardly to be distinguished, in its earliest stages, from the handicraft trades of the guilds, otherwise than by the greater number of workmen simultaneously employed by one and the same individual capital. The workshop of the medireval master handicraftsman is simply enlarged. * * *

        We saw in a former chapter, that a certain minimum amount of capital was necessary, in order that the number of labourers simultaneously employed, and consequently, the amount of surplusvalue produced, might suffice to liberate the employer himself from manual labour, to convert him from a small master into a capitalist, and thus formally to establish capitalist production. We now see that a certain minimum amount is a necessary condition for the conversion of numerous isolated and independent processes into one combined social process.

        We also saw that at first, the subjection of labour to capital was only a formal result of the fact, that the labourer, instead of working for himself, works for and consequently under the capitalist. By the co-operation of numerous wage-labourers, the sway of capital develops into a requisite for carrying on the labour-process itself, into a real requisite of production. That a capitalist should command on the field of production, is now as indispensable as that a general should command on the field of battle.

        All combined labour on a large scale requires, more or less, a directing authority, in order to secure the harmonious working of the individual activities, and to perform the general functions that have their origin in the action of the combined organism, as distinguished from the action of its separate organs. A single violin player is his own conductor; an orchestra requires a separate ones. The work of directing, superintending, and adjusting, becomes one of the functions of capital, from the moment that the labour under the control of capital, becomes co-operative. Once a function of capital, it acquires special characteristics.

        The directing motive, the end and aim of capitalist production, is to extract the greatest possible amount of surplus-value, and consequently to exploit labour-power to the greatest possible extent. As the number of the co-operating labourers increases, so too does their resistance to the domination of .capital, and with it, the necessity for capital to overcome this resistance by counter-pressure. The control exercised by the capitalist is not only a special function, due to the nature of the social labour-process, and peculiar to that process, but it is, at the same time, a function of the exploitation of a social labour-process, and is consequently rooted in the unavoidable antagonism between the exploiter and the living and labouring raw material he exploits.

        Again, in proportion to the increasing mass o f the means of production, now no longer the property of the labourer, but of the capitalist, the necessity increases for, some effective control over the proper application of those means. Moreover, the co-operation of wage-labourers is entirely brought about by the capital that employs them. Their union into one single productive body and the establishment of a connexion between their individual functions are matters foreign and external to them, are not their own act, but the act of the capital that brings and keeps them together, Hence the connexion existing between their various labours appears to them, ideally, in the shape of a preconceived plan of the capitalist, and practically in the shape of the authority of the same capitalist, in the shape of the powerful will of another, who subjects their activity to his aims. If, then, the control of the capitalist is in substance two-fold by reason of the two-fold nature of the process of production itself,-which, on the one hand, is a social process for producing use-values, on the other, a process for creating surplus value-in form that control is despotic. As co-operation extends its scale, this despotism takes forms peculiar to itself. Just as at first the capitalist is relieved from actual labour so 500n as his capital has reached that minimum amount with which capitalist production, as such, begins, so now, he hands over the work of direct and constant supervision of the individual workmen, and groups of workmen, to a special kind of wage-labourer. An industrial army of workmen, under the command of a capitalist, requires, like a real army, officers (managers), and sergeants (foremen, over lookers), who, while the work is being done, command in the name of the capitalist. The work of supervision becomes their established and exclusive function. When comparing the mode of production of isolated peasants and artisans with production by slave-labour the political economist counts this labour of superintendence among the faux frais of production But, when considering the capitalist mode of production, he, on the contrary, treats the work of control made necessary by the co-operative character of the labour-process as identical with the different work of control, necessitated by the capitalist character of that process and the antagonism of interests between capitalist and labourer. It is not because he is a leader of industry that a man is a capitalist; on the contrary, he is a leader of industry because he is a capitalist. The leadership of industry is an attribute of capital just as in feudal times the functions of general and judge, were attributes of landed property.

        The labourer is the owner of his labour-power until he has done bargaining for its sale with the capitalist; and he can sell no more than what he has-i.e., his' individual, isolated labour-power. This state of things is in no way altered by the fact that the capitalist, instead of buying the labour-power of one man, buys that of 100, and enters into separate contracts with 100 unconnected men instead of with one. He is at liberty to set the 100 men to work, without letting them co-operate. He pays them the value of 100 independent labour-powers, but he does not pay for the combined labour-power of the hundred. Being independent of each other, the labourers are isolated persons, who enter into relations with the capitalist, but not with one another. This co-operation begins only with the labour-process, but they have then ceased to belong to themselves. On entering that process, they become incorporated with capital. As co-operators, as members of a working organism they are but special modes of existence of capital. Hence, the productive pow.er developed by the labourer when working in co-operation, is the productive power of capital. This power is developed gratuitously, whenever the workmen are placed under given conditions, and it is capital that places them under such conditions. Because this power costs capital nothing, and because, on the other hand, the labourer himself does not develop it before his labour belongs to capital, it appears as a power with which capital is endowed by Nature-a productive power that is immanent in capital.

        The colossal effects of simple co-operation are to be seen in the gigantic structures of the ancient Asiatics, Egyptians, Etruscans,' &c. ""It has happened in times past that these Oriental States, after supplying the expenses of their civil and military establishments, have found themselves in possession of a surplus which they could apply to works of magnificence or utility and in the construction of these their command over the hands and arms of almost the entire nonagricultural population has produced stupendous monuments which still indicate their power. The teeming valley of the Nile... produced food for a swarming non-agricultural population, and this food, belonging to the monarch and the priesthood, afforded the means of erecting the mighty monuments which filled the land . . . . In moving the colossal statues and vast masses of which the transport creates wonder, human labour almost alone, was prodigally used . . . . The number of the labourers and the concentration of their efforts sufficed. We see mighty coral reefs rising from the depths of the ocean into islands and firm land, yet each individual depositor is puny, weak, and contemptible. The non-agricultural labourers of an Asiatic monarchy have little but their individual bodily exertions to bring to the task, but their number is their strength, and the power of directing these masses gave rise to the palaces and temples, the pyramids, and the armies of gigantic statues of which the remains astonish and perplex us. It is that confinement of the revenues which feed them, to one or a few hands, which makes such undertakings possible."" This power of Asiatic and Egyptian kings, Etruscan theocrats, &c., has in modern society been transferred to the capitalist, whether he be an isolated, or as in joint-stock companies, a collective capitalist.

        Co-operation, such as we find it at the dawn of human development, among races who live by the chase, or, say, in the agriculture of Indian communities, is based, on the one hand, on ownership in common of the means of production, and on the other hand, on the fact, that in those cases, each individual has no more torn himself off from the navel-string of his tribe or community, than each bee has freed itself from connexion with the hive. Such co-operation is distinguished from capitalistic co-operation b y both of the above characteristics. The sporadic application of co-operation on a large scale in ancient times, in the Middle Ages and in modern colonies, reposes on relations of dominion and servitude, principally on slavery. The capitalistic form, on the contrary, pre-supposes from first to last, the free wage-labourer, who sells his labour power to capital. Historically, however, this form is developed in opposition to peasant agriculture and to the carrying on of independent handicrafts whether in guilds or not. From the standpoint of these, capitalistic co-operation does not manifest itself as a particular historical form of co-operation, but co-operation itself appears to be a historical form peculiar to, and specifically distinguishing, the capitalist process of production.

        Just as the social productive power of labour that is developed by co-operation, appears to be the productive power of capital, so co-operation itself, contrasted with the process of production carried on by isolated independent labourers, or even by small employers, appears to be a specific form of the capitalist process of production. It is the first change experienced by the actual labour-process, when subjected to capital. This change takes place spontaneously. The simultaneous employment of a large number of wage-labourers, in one and the same process, which is a necessary condition of this change, also forms the starting-point of capitalist production. This point coincides with the birth of capital itself. If then, on the one hand, the capitalist mode of production presents itself to us historically, as a necessary condition to the transformation of the labour-process into a social process, so, on the other hand, this social form of the labour-process presents itself, as a method employed by capital for the more profitable exploitation of labour, by increasing that labour's productiveness.

        In the elementary form, under which we have hitherto viewed it, co-operation is a necessary concomitant of all production on a large scale, but it does not, in itself, represent a fixed form characteristic of a particular epoch in the development of the capitalist mode of production. At the most it appears to do so, and that only approximately, in the handicraft-like beginnings of manufacture, and in that kind of agriculture on a large scale, which corresponds to the epoch of manufacture, and is distinguished from peasant agriculture, mainly by the number of the labourers simultaneously employed, and by the mass of the means of production concentrated for their use. Simple co-operation is always the prevailing form, in those branches of production in which capital operates on a large scale and division of labour and machinery play but a subordinate part.

        Co-operation ever constitutes the fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production; nevertheless the elementary form of co-operation continues to subsist as a particular form of capitalist production side by side with the more developed forms of that mode of production.

             CHAPTER XIV. DIVISION OF LABOUR AND MANUFACTURE

                           Section 1. Two-fold Origin of Manufacture

         (1) By the assemblage, in one workshop under the control of a single capitalist, of labourers belonging to various independent handicrafts, but through whose hands a given article must pass on its way to completion. A carriage, for example, was formerly the product of the labour of a great number of independent artificers, such as wheelwrights, harness-makers, tailors, locksmiths, upholsterers, turners, fringe-makers, glaziers, painters, polishers, gilders, &c. In the manufacture of carriages, however, all these different artificers are assembled in one building where they work into one another's hands. * * *

         (2) Manufacture also arises in a way exactly the reverse of this-namely, by one capitalist employing simultaneously in one workshop a number of artificers, who all do the same, or the same kind of work, such as making paper, type, or needles. This is co-operation in its most elementary form. Each of these artificers (with the help, perhaps, of one or two apprentices), makes the entire commodity, and he consequently performs in succession all the operations necessary for its production. He still works in his old handicraft-like way. But very soon external circumstances cause a different use to be made of the concentration of the workmen on one spot, and of the simultaneousness of their work. An increased quantity o f the article has perhaps to be delivered within a given time. The work is therefore re-distributed. Instead of each man being allowed to perform all the various operations in succession, these operations are changed into disconnected, isolated ones, carried on side by side; each is assigned to a different artificer, and the whole of them together are performed simultaneously by the co-operating workmen. * * *

        The mode in which manufacture arises, its growth out of handicrafts, is therefore two-fold. On the one hand, it arises from the union of various independent handicrafts, which become stripped of their independence and specialised to such an extent as to be reduced to mere supplementary partial processes in the production of one particular commodity. On the other hand, it arises from the co-operation of artificers of one handicraft; it splits up that particular handicraft into its various detail operations, isolating, and making these operations independent of one another up to the point where each becomes the exclusive function of a particular labourer. On the one hand, therefore, manufacture either introduces division of labour into a process of production, or further develops that division; on the other hand, it unites together handicrafts that were formerly separate. But whatever may have been its particular starting-point, its final form is invariably the same-a productive mechanism whose parts are human beings. * * *

                       Section 2. The Detail Labourer and His Implements

        If we now go more into detail, it is, in the first place, clear that a labourer who all his life performs one and the same simple operation, converts his whole body into the automatic, specialised implement of that operation. Consequently, he takes less time in doing it, than the artificer who performs a whole series of operations in succession. But the collective labourer, who constitutes the living mechanism of manufacture, is made up solely of such specialized detail labourers. Hence, in comparison with the independent handicraft, more is produced in a given time, or the productive power of labour is increased. Moreover, when once this fractional work is established as the exclusive function of one person, the methods it employs become perfected. The workman's continued repetition of the same simple act, and the concentration of his attention on it, teach him by experience how to attain the desired effects with the minimum of exertion. But since there are always several generations of labourers living at one time, and working together at the manufacture of a given article, the technical skill, the tricks of the trade thus acquired, become established, and are accumulated and handed down. Manufacture, in fact, produces the skill of the detail labourer, by reproducing, and systematically driving to an extreme within the workshop, the naturally developed differentiation of trades, which it found ready to hand in society at large. On the other hand, the conversion of fractional work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them into castes, or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes , to ossify them into guilds. * * *

        An artificer, who performs one after another the various fractional operations in the production of a finished article, must at one time change his place, at another his tools. The transition from one operation to another interrupts the flow of his labour, and creates, so to say, gaps in his working-day. These gaps close up as soon as he is tied to one and the same operation all day long; they vanish in proportion as the changes in his work diminish. The resulting increased productive power is owing either to an increased expenditure of labour-power in a given time-i.e., to increased intensity"" of labour-or to a decrease in the amount of labour-power unproductively consumed. The extra expenditure of power, demanded by every transition from rest to motion, is made up for by prolonging the duration of the normal velocity when once acquired. On the other hand, constant labour of one uniform kind disturbs the intensity and flow of a man's animal spirits, which find recreation and delight in mere change of activity. * * *

        Early in the manufacturing period, the principle of lessening the necessary labour-time in the production of commodities was accepted and formulated: and the use of machines, especially for certain simple first processes that have to be conducted on a very large scale, and with the application of great force, sprang up here and there. Thus, at an early period in paper manufacture, the tearing up of the rags was done by paper-mills; and in metal works, the pounding of the ores was effected by stamping mills. The Roman Empire had handed down the elementary form of all machinery in the water-wheel.

        The handicraft period bequeathed to us the great inventions of the compass, of gunpowder, of type-printing, and of the automatic clock. But, on the whole, machinery played that subordinate part which Adam Smith assigns to it in comparison with division of labour. The sporadic use of machinery in the 17th century was of the greatest importance, because it supplied the great mathematicians of that time with a practical basis and stimulant to the creation of the science of mechanics.

        The collective labourer, formed by the combination of a number of detail labourers, is the machinery specially characteristic of the manufacturing period. The various operations that are performed in turns by the producer of a commodity, and coalesce one with another during the progress of production, lay claim to him in various ways. In one operation he must exert more strength, in another more skill, in another more attention; and the same individual does not possess all these qualities in an equal degree. After Manufacture has once separated, made independent, and isolated the various operations, the labourers are divided, classified, arid grouped according to their predominating qualities. If their natural endowments are, on the one hand, the foundation on which ,the division of labour is built up, on the other hand, Manufacture, once introduced, develops in them new powers that are by nature fitted only for limited and special functions. The collective labourer now possesses, in an equal degree of excellence, all the qualities requisite for production, and expends them in the most economical manner, by exclusively employing all his organs, consisting of particular labourers, or groups of labourers, in performing their special functions. The one-sidedness and the deficiencies of the detail labourer become perfections when he is a part of the collective labourer. The habit of doing only one thing converts him into a never failing instrument, while his connexian with the whale mechanism campels him to' work with the regularity of the parts of a machine.

        Since the collective labourer has functions, bath simple and compIex, bath high and law, his members, the individual labour powers, require different degrees of training, and must therefore have different values. Manufacture, therefore, develops a hierarchy of labour-powers, to which there corresponds a scale of wages. If, the one hand, the individual labourers are appropriated and annexed far life by a limited function; and the other hand, the various operations of the hierarchy are parceled out among the labourers according to' bath their natural and their acquired capabilities .Every process of production, however, requires certain simple manipulations, which every man is capable of doing. They too are now severed from their connexian with the mare pregnant moments of activity, and ossified into exclusive functions of specially appointed labourers. Hence, Manufacture begets, in every handicraft that it seizes upon, a class of so-called unskilled labaurers, a class which handicraft industry strictly excluded. * * *

         Section 4. Division of Labour in Manufacture, and Division
                                          of Labour in Society

        We first considered the origin of Manufacture, then its simple elements, then the detail labourer and his implements, and finally, the totality of the mechanism. We shall now lightly touch upon the relation between the division of labour in manufacture, and the social division of labour, which farms the -foundation of all production of commodities.

        If we keep labour alone in view, we may designate the separation of social production into its main divisions or genera-viz., agriculture, industries, &c., as division of labour in general, and the splitting up of these families into species and sub-species, as division of labour in particular, and the division of labour within the workshop as division of labour in singular or in detail.

        Division of labour in a society, and the corresponding tying dawn of individuals to' a particular calling, develops itself, just as does the division of labour in manufacture, from apposite starting-paints. Within a family, and after further development with a tribe, there springs up naturally a division of labour, caused by differences of sex and age, a division that is consequently based an a purely physiological foundation, which division enlarges its materials by the expansion of the community, by the increase of population, and mare especially, by the conflicts between different tribes, and the subjugation of one tribe by another. On the other hand, as I have before remarked, the exchange of products springs up at the points where different families, tribes, communities, come in contact; for, in the beginning of civilisation, it is not private individuals but families, tribes, &c ., that meet on an independent footing. Different communities find different means of production and different means of subsistence in their natural environment. Hence, their modes of production, and of living, and their products are different. It is this spontaneously developed difference which, when different communities come in contact, calls forth the mutual exchange of products, and the consequent gradual conversion of those products into commodities. * * *

        The foundation of every division of labour that is well developed, and brought about by the exchange of commodities, is the separation between town and country. It may be said, that the whole economic history of society is summed up in the movement of this antithesis. We pass it over, however, for the present.

        Just as a certain number of simultaneously employed labourers are the material pre-requisites for division of labour in manufacture, so are the number and density of the populations, which here correspond to the agglomeration in one workshop, a necessary condition for the division of labour in society. Nevertheless, this density is more or less relative. A relatively thinly populated country, with well-developed means of communication, has a denser population than' a more numerously populated country, with badly-developed means of communication; and in this sense the Northern States of the American Union, for instance, are more thickly populated than India.

        Since the production and the circulation of commodities are the general pre-requisites of the capitalist mode of production, division of labour in manufacture demands, that division of labour in society at large should previously have attained a certain degree of development. Inversely, the former division reacts upon and develops and multiplies the latter. Simultaneously, with the differentiation of the instruments of labour, the industries that produce these instruments become more and more differentiated. If the manufacturing system seize upon an industry, which, previously, was carried on in connexion with others, either as a chief or as a subordinate industry, and by one producer, these industries immediately separate their connexion, and become independent. If it seizes upon a particular stage in the p roduction of a commodity, the other stages of its production become converted into so many independent industries. It has al ready been stated, that where the finished article consists merely of a n umber of parts fitted together, the detail operations may re-establish themselves as genuine and separate handicrafts. In order to carry out more perfectly the division of labour in manufacture, a single branch of production is, according to the varieties of its raw material, or the various forms that one and the same raw material may assume, split up into numerous, and to some extent, entirely new manufactures. Accordingly, in France alone, in the first half of the 18th century, over 100 different kinds of silk stuffs were woven, and, in Avignon, it was law, that ""every apprentice should devote himself to only one sort of fabrication, and should not learn the preparation of several kinds of stuff at once."" The territorial division of labour, which confines special b ranches of production to special districts of a country, acquires fresh stimulus from the manufacturing system, which exploits every special advantage. The Colonial system and the opening out of the markets of the world, both of which are included in the general conditions of existence of the manufacturing period, furnish rich material for developing the division of labour in society. It is not the place, here, to go on to show how division of labour seizes upon, not only the economic, but every other sphere of society, and everywhere lays the foundation of that all engrossing system of specialising and sorting men, that development in a man of one single faculty at the expense of all other faculties, which caused A. Ferguson, the master of Adam Smith, to exclaim: ""We make a nation of Helots, and have no free citizens.""

        But, in spite of the numerous analogies and links connecting them, division of labour in the interior of a society, and that in the interior of a workshop, differ not only in degree, but also in kind. The analogy appears most indisputable where there is an invisible bond uniting the various branches of trade. For instance the cattle-breeder produces hides, the tanner makes the hides into leather, and the shoemaker, the leather into boots. Here the thing produced by each of them is but a step towards the final form, which is the product of all their labours combined. There are, besides, all the various industries that supply the cattle-breeder, the tanner, and the shoemaker with the means of production. Now it is quite possible t o imagine, with Adam Smith, that the difference between the above social division of labour, and the division in manufacture, is merely subjective, exists merely for the observer, who, in a manufacture, can see with one glance, all the numerous operations being performed on one spot, while in the instance given above; the spreading out of the work over great areas, and the great number of people employed in each branch of labour, obscure the connexion. But what is it that forms the bond between the independent labours of the cattle-breeder, the tanner, and the shoemaker? It is the fact that their respective products are commodities. What, on the other hand, characterises division of labour in manufactures? The fact that the detail labourer produces no commodities, It is only the common product of all the detail labourers that becomes a commodity. Division of labour in society is brought about by the purchase and sale of the products of different branches of industry while the connexion between the detail operations in a workshop, is due to the sale of the labour-power of several workmen to one capitalist, who applies it as combined labour-power. The division of labour in the workshop implies concentration of the means of production in the hands of one capitalist; the division of labour in society implies their dispersion among many independent producers of commodities. While within the workshop, the iron law of proportionality subjects’ definite numbers of workmen to definite functions, in the society outside the workshop, chance and caprice have full play in distributing the producers and their means of production among the various branches of industry. The different spheres of production, it is true, constantly tend to an equilibrium: for, on the one hand, while each producer of a commodity is bound to produce a use-value, to satisfy a particular social want, and while the extent of these wants differs quantitatively, still there exists an inner relation which settles their proportions into a regular system, and that system one of spontaneous growth; and, on the other hand, the law of the value of commodities ultimately determines how much of its disposable workingtime society can expend on each particular class of commodities. But this constant tendency to equilibrium, of the various spheres of production, is exercised, only in the shape of a reaction against the constant upsetting of this equilibrium. The a priori system on which the division of labour, within the workshop, is regularly carried out, becomes in the division of labour within the society, an a posteriori, nature-imposed, necessity, controlling the lawless caprice of the producers, and perceptible in the barometrical fluctuations of the market-prices. Division of labour within the workshop implies the undisputed authority of the capitalist over men that are but parts of a mechanism that belongs to him. The division of labour within the society brings into contact independent commodity producers, who acknowledge no other authority but that of competition, of the coercion exerted by the pressure of their mutual interests; just as in the animal kingdom, the bellum omnium contra omnes more or less preserves the conditions of existence of every species. The same bourgeois mind which praises division of labour in the workshop, life-long annexation of the labourer to a partial operation, and his complete subjection to capital, as being an organization of labour that increases its productiveness-that same bourgeois mind denounces with equal vigour every conscious attempt to socially control and regulate the process of production, as an inroad upon such sacred things as the rights of property, freedom and unrestricted play for the bent of the individual capitalist. It is very characteristic that the enthusiastic apologists of the factory system have nothing more damning to urge against a general organisation of the labour of society, than that it would turn all society into one immense factory.

        If, in a society with capitalist production, anarchy in the social division of labour and despotism in that of the workshop are mutual conditions the one of the other, we find, on the contrary, in those earlier forms of society in which the separation of trades has been spontaneously developed, then crystallised, and finally made permanent by law, on the one hand, a specimen of the organization of the labour of society, in accordance with an approved and authoritative plan, and on the other, the entire exclusion of division of labour in the workshop, or at all events a mere dwarf-like or sporadic and accidental development of the same.

        Those small and extremely ancient Indian communities, some of which have continued down to this day, are based on possession in common of the land, on the blending of agriculture and handicrafts, and on an unalterable division of labour, which serves, whenever a new community is started, as a plan and scheme ready cut and dried. * * * The law that regulates the division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of Nature, at the same time that each individual artificer, the smith, the carpenter, and so on, conducts in his workshop all the operations of his handicraft in the traditional way, but independently, and without recognising any authority over him. The simplicity of the organisation for production in these self-sufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same form, and when accidentally destroyed, spring up again on the spot and with the same name-this simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of Asiatic societies, an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of Asiatic States, and the never-ceasing changes of dynasty. The structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the storm-clouds of the political sky.

        The rules of the guilds, as I have said before, by limiting most strictly the number of apprentices and journeymen that a single master could employ, prevented him from becoming a capitalist. Moreover, he could not employ his journeymen in many other handicrafts than the one in which he was a master. The guilds zealously repelled every encroachment by the capital of merchants, the only form of free capital with which they came in contact. A merchant could buy every kind of commodity, but labour as a commodity he could not buy. He existed only on sufferance, as a dealer in the products of the handicrafts. If circumstances called for a further division of labour, the existing guilds split themselves up into varieties, or founded new guilds by the side of the old ones; all this, however, without concentrating various handicrafts in a single workshop. Hence, the guild organisation, however much it may have contributed by separating, isolating, and perfecting the handicrafts, to create the material conditions for the existence of manufacture, excluded division of labour in the workshop. On the whole, the labourer and his means of production remained closely united, like the snail with its shell, and thus there wanted the principal basis of manufacture, the separation of the labourer from his means of production, and the conversion of these means into capital.

        While division of labour in society at large, whether such division be brought about or not by exchange of commodities, is common to economic formations of society the most diverse, division of labour in the workshop, as practised by manufacture, is a special creation of the capitalist mode of production alone.

                     Section 5. The Capitalistic Character of Manufacture

         An increased number of labourers under the control of one capitalist is the natural starting-point, as well of co-operation generally, as of manufacture in particular, But the division of labour in manufacture makes this increase in the number of workmen a technical necessity. The minimum number that any given capitalist is bound to employ is here prescribed by the previously established division of labour. On the other hand, the advantages of further division are obtainable only by adding to the number of workmen, and this can be done only by adding multiples of the various detail groups. But an increase in the variable component of the capital employed necessitates an increase in its constant component, too, in the workshops, implements, &c., and, in particular, in the raw material, the call for which grows quicker than the number of workmen. The quantity of it consumed in a given time, by a given amount of labour, increases in the same ratio as does the productive power of that labour in consequence of its division. Hence, it is a law, based. on the very nature of manufacture, that the minimum amount of capital, which is bound to be in the hands of each capitalist, must keep increasing; in other words, that the transformation into capital of the social means of production and subsistence must keep extending.

        In manufacture, as well as in simple co-operation, the collective working organism is a form of existence of capital. The mechanism that is made up of numerous individual detail labourers belongs to the capitalist. Hence, the productive power resulting from a combination of labours appears to be the productive power of capital. Manufacture proper not only subjects the previously independent workman to the discipline and command of capital, but, in addition, creates a hierarchic gradation of the workmen themselves. While simple co-operation leaves the mode of working by the individual for the most part unchanged, manufacture thoroughly revolutionizes it, and seizes labour-power by its very roots. It converts the labourer into a crippled monstrosity, by forcing his detail dexterity at the expense of a world of productive capabilities and instincts; just as in the States of La Plata they butcher a whole beast for the sake of his hide or his tallow. Not only is the detail work distributed to the different individuals, but the individual himself is made the automatic motor of a fractional operation, and the absurd fable of Menenius Agrippa, which makes man a mere fragment of his own body, becomes realised. If, at first, the workman sells his labour-power to capital, because the material means of producing a commodity fail him, now his very labour-power refuses its services unless it has been sold to capital. Its functions can be exercised only in an environment that exists in the workshop of the capitalist after the sale. By nature unfitted to make anything independently, the manufacturing labourer develops productive activity as it mere appendage of the capitalist's workshop. As the chosen people bore in their features the sign manual of Jehovah, so division of labour brands the manufacturing workman as the property of capital.

        The knowledge, the judgment, and the will, which, though in ever so small a degree, are practised by the independent peasant or handicraftsman , in the same way as the savage makes the whole art of war consist in the exercise of his personal cunning-these faculties are now required only for the workshop as a whole. Intelligence in production expands in one direction, because it vanishes in many others. That is lost by the detail labourers, is concentrated in the capital that employs them. It is a result of the division of labour in manufactures that the labourer is brought face to face with the intellectual potencies of the material process of production, as the property of another, and as a ruling power. This separation begins in simple co-operation, where the capitalist represents to the single workman, the oneness and the will of the associated labour. It is developed in manufacture which cuts down the labourer into a detail labourer. It is completed in modern industry, which makes science a productive force distinct from labour and presses it into the service of capital.

        In manufacture, in order to make the collective labourer, and through him capital, rich in social productive power, each labourer must be made poor in individual productive powers. ""Ignorance is the mother of industry as well as of superstition. Reflection and fancy are subject to err; but a habit of moving the hand or the foot is independent of either. Manufactures, accordingly, prosper most where the mind is least consulted, and where the workshop may . . . be considered as an engine, the parts of which are men; "" As a matter of fact, some few manufacturers in the middle of the 18th century preferred for certain operations that were trade secrets, to employ half-idiotic persons.

        ""The understandings of the greater part of men,"" says Adam Smith, ""are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations . . . has no occasion to exert his understanding . . . . He generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become."" After describing the stupidity of the detail labourer he goes on: ""The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind. . . . It corrupts even the activity of his body and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employments than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems in this manner to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilised society, this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall."" For preventing the complete deterioration of the great mass of the people by division of labour, A. Smith recommends education of the people by the State, but prudently, and in homeopathic doses. G. Garnier, his French translator and commentator, who, under the first French Empire, quite naturally developed into a senator, quite as naturally opposes him on this point. Education of the masses, he urges, violates the first law of the division of labour, and with it ""our whole social system would be proscribed."" ""Like All other divisions of labour,"" he says, ""that between hand labour and head labour is more pronounced and decided in proportion as society ( he rightly uses this word, for capital, landed property and their State ) becomes richer. This division of labour, like every other, is an effect of past, and a cause of future progress . . . ough the government then to work in opposition to this division of labour, and to hinder its natural course? Ought it to expend a part of the public money in the attempt to confound and blend together two classes of labour, which are striving after division and separation?”

        Some crippling of body and mind is inseparable even from division of labour in society as a whole. Since, however, manufacture carries this social separation of branches of labour much further, and also, by its peculiar division, attacks the individual at the very roots of his life it is the first to afford the materials for, and to give a start to, industrial pathology.

        ""To subdivide a man is to execute him, if he deserves the sentence, to assassinate him if he does not. . . . The subdivision of labour is the assassination of a people.""

        Co-operation based on division of labour, in other words, manufacture, commences as a spontaneous formation. As soon as it attains some consistence and extension, it becomes the recognized methodical and systematic form of capitalist production. History shows how the division of labour peculiar to manufacture, strictly so called, acquires the best adapted form at first by experience, as it were behind the backs of the actors, and then, like the guild handicrafts, strives to hold fast that form when once found, and here and there succeeds in keeping it for centuries. Any alteration in this form, except in trivial matters, is solely owing to a revolution in the instruments of labour. Modern manufacture wherever it arises-I do not here allude to modern industry based on machinery—either finds the disjecta membra poetre ready to hand, and only waiting to be collected together, as is the case in the manufacture of clothes in large towns, or it can easily apply the principle of division, simply by exclusively assigning the various operations of a handicraft (such as book-binding) to particular men. In such cases, a week's experience is enough to determine the proportion between the numbers of the hands necessary for the various functions. By decomposition of handicrafts, by specialisation of the instruments of labour, by the formation of detail labourers, and by grouping and combining the latter into a single mechanism, division of labour in manufacture creates a qualitative gradation, and a quantitative proportion in the social process of production; it consequently creates a definite organisation of the labour of society, and thereby develops at the same time new productive forces in the society. In its specific capitalist form-and under the given conditions, it could take no other form than a capitalistic one manufacture is but a particular method of begetting relative surplus-value, or of augmenting at the expense o f the labourer the self-expansion of capital-usually called social wealth, ""Wealth of Nations,"" &c. It increases the social productive power of labour, not only for the benefit of the capitalist instead of for that of the labourer, but it does this by crippling the individual labourers. It creates new conditions for the lordship of capital over labour. If, therefore, on the one hand, it presents itself historically as a progress and as a necessary phase in the economic development of society, on the other hand, it is a refined and civilized method of exploitation.

        Political Economy, which as an independent science, first sprang into being during the period of manufacture, views the social division of labour only from the standpoint of manufacture, and sees in it only the means of producing more commodities with a given quantity of labour, and, consequently, of cheapening commodities and hurrying on the accumulation of capital. In most striking contrast with this accentuation of quantity and exchange-value, is the attitude of the writers of classical antiquity, who hold exclusively by quality and use-value. In consequence of the separation of the social branches of production, commodities are better made, the various bents and talents of men select a suitable field, and without some restraint no important results can be obtained anywhere.  Hence both product and producer are improved by division of labour. If the growth of the quantity produced is occasionally mentioned, this is only done with reference to the greater abundance of use values. There is not a word alluding to exchange-value or to the cheapening of commodities. This aspect, from the standpoint of use-value alone, is taken as well by Plato, who treats division of labour as the foundation on which the division of society into classes is based, as by Xenophon, who with characteristic bourgeois instinct, approaches more nearly to division of labour within the workshop. Plato's Republic, in so far as division of labour is treated in it, as the formative principle of the State, is merely the Athenian idealization of the Egyptian system of castes, Egypt having served as the model of an industrial country to many of his contemporaries also, amongst others to Isocrates, and it continued to have this importance to the Greeks of the Roman Empire.

        During the manufacturing period proper, i.e., the period during which manufacture is the predominant form taken by capitalist production, many obstacles are opposed to the full development of the peculiar tendencies of manufacture. Although manufacture creates, as we have already seen, a simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled, simultaneously with their hierarchic arrangement in classes, yet the number of the unskilled labourers, owing to the preponderating influence of the skilled, remains very limited. Although it adapts the detail operations to the various degrees of maturity, strength, and development of the living instruments of labour thus conducing to exploitation of women and children, yet this tendency as a whole is wrecked on the habits and the resistance of the male labourers. Although the splitting up of handicrafts lowers the cost of forming the workman, and thereby lowers his value, yet for the more difficult detail work, a longer apprenticeship is necessary, and, even where it would be superfluous, is jealously insisted upon by the workmen. In England, for instance, we find the laws of apprenticeship, with their seven years' probation, in full force down to the end of the manufacturing period; and they are not thrown on one side till the advent of Modern Industry. Since handicraft skill is the foundation of manufacture and since the mechanism of manufacture as a whole possesses no framework, apart from the labourers themselves, capital is constantly compelled to wrestle with the insubordination of the workmen. ""By the infirmity of human nature,"" says friend Ure,"" it happens that the more skilful the workman, the more self-willed and intractable he is apt to become, and of course the less fit a component of a mechanical system in which . . . he may do great damage to the whole."" Hence throughout the whole manufacturing period there runs the complaint of want of discipline among the workmen. And had we not the testimony of contemporary' writers, the simple facts, that during the period between the 1 6th century and the epoch of Modern Industry, capital failed to become the master of the whole disposable working-time of the manufacturing labourers, that manufacturers are short-lived, and change their locality from one country to another with the emigrating or immigrating workmen, these 'facts would speak volumes. ""Order must in one way or another be established,"" exclaims in 1770 the oft-cited author of the ""Essay on Trade and Commerce."" ""Order,"" re-echoes Dr. Andrew Ure 66 years later, ""Order"" was wanting in manufacture based on ""the scholastic dogma of division of labour,"" and ""Arkwright created order.""

        At the same time manufacture was unable, either to seize upon the production of society to its full extent, or to revolutionise that production to its very core. It towered up as an economic work of art, on the broad foundation of the town handicrafts, and of the rural domestic industries. At a given stage in its development, the  narrow technical basis on which manufacture rested, came into conflict with requirements of production that were created by manufacture itself.

        One of its most finished creations was the workshop for the production of the instruments of labour themselves including especially the complicated mechanical apparatus then already employed. A machine-factory, says Ure, ""displayed t h e division of labour in manifold gradations-the file, the drill, the lathe, having e a c h its different workman in the order of skill."" (P. 21.) This workshop, the product of the division of labour in manufacture, produced in. its turn-machines. It is they that swept away the handicraftsman's work as the regulating principle of social production. Thus, on the one hand, the technical reason for the life-long annexation of the workman to a detail function is removed. On the other hand, the fetters that this same principle laid on the dominion of capital fall away.

7. The simple belief in the inventive genius exercised a priori by the individual capitalist in division of labour, exists now-a-days only among German professors, of the stamp of Herr Roscher, who, to recompense the capitalist from whose Jovian head division of labour sprang ready formed, dedicates to him ""various wages"" (diverse ArbeitsHihne ). The more or less extensive application of division of labour depends on length of purse, not on greatness of genius. [Marx]

8. With Plato, division o f labour within the community is a development from the multifarious requirements, and the limited capacities o f individuals. The main point with him is, that the labourer must adapt himself to the work, not the work to the labourer; which latter is unavoidable, if h e carries on several trades at once, thus making one or the other of them subordinate. So in Thucydides: ""Seafaring is an art like any other, and cannot, as circumstances require, b e carried on as a subsidiary occupation; nay, other subsidiary occupations cannot b e carried on alongside of this one."" If the work, says Plato, has t o wait for the labourer, the critical point in the process is missed and the article spoiled. The same Platonic idea is found recurring in the protest o f the English bleachers against the clause in the Factory Act that provides fixed meal-times for all operatives. Their business can not wait the convenience of the work men, for "" in the various operations of singeing, washing, bleaching, mangling, calendering, and dyeing, none o f them can be stopped at a given moment without risk of damage . . . to enforce the same dinner hour for all the work people might occasionally subject valuable goods to the risk of d

                  CHAPTER XV. MACHINERY AND MODERN INDUSTRY

                          Section 1. The Development of Machinery

        John Stuart Mill says in his ""Principles of Political Economy"": "" I t is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being."" That is, however, by no means the aim of the capitalistic application of machinery. Like every other increase in the productiveness of labour, machinery is intended to cheapen commodities, and, by shortening that portion of the working-day, in which the labourer works for himself, to lengthen the other portion that he gives, without an equivalent, to the capitalist. In short, it is a means for producing surplus-value.

        In manufacture, the revolution in the mode of production begins with the labour-power, in modern industry it begins with the instruments of labour. Our first inquiry then is how the instruments of labour are converted from tools into machines, or what is the difference between a machine and the implements of handicraft? We are only concerned here with striking and general characteristics; for epochs in the history of society are no more separated from each other by hard and fast lines of demarcation, than are geological epochs. * * *

          Section 3. The Proximate Effects of Machinery on the Workman

        The starting-point of Modern Industry is, as we have shown, the revolution in the instruments of labour, and this revolution attains its most highly developed form in the organised system of machinery in a factory. Before we inquire how human material is incorporated with this objective organism, let us consider some general effects of this revolution on the labourer himself.

       A. APPROPRIATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY LABOUR-POWER BY
            CAPITAL. THE EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN

        In so far as machinery dispenses with muscular power, it becomes a means of employing labourers of slight muscular strength, and those whose bodily development is incomplete, but whose limbs are all the more supple. The labour of women and children was, therefore, the first thing sought for by capitalists who used machinery. That mighty substitute for labour and labourers was forthwith changed into a means for increasing the number of wage-labourers by enrolling, under the direct sway of capital, every member of the workman's family, without distinction of age or sex. Compulsory work for the capitalist usurped the place, not only of the children's play, but also of free labour at home within moderate limits for the support of the family.

        The value o f labour-power was determined not only by the labour-time necessary to maintain the individual adult labourer, but also by that necessary to maintain h is family. Machinery, by throwing every member of that family on to the labour-market, spreads the value of the man's labour-power over his whole family. It thus depreciates his labour-power. To purchase the labour-power of a family of four workers may, perhaps, cost more than it formerly did to purchase the labour-power of the head of the family, but, in return, four days' labour takes the place of one, and their price falls in proportion to the excess of the surplus-labour of four over the surplus-labour of one. In order that the family may live, four people must now, not only labour, but expend surplus-labour for the capitalist. Thus we see, that machinery, while augmenting the human material that forms the principal object of capital's exploiting power, at the same time raises the degree 0-£ exploitation . * * *

                        B. PROLONGATION OF THE WORKING-DAY

        If machinery be the most powerful means for increasing the productiveness of labour i.e., for shortening the working-time required in the production of a commodity, it becomes in the hands of capital the most powerful means, in those industries first invaded by it, for lengthening the working-day beyond all bounds set by human nature. It creates, on the one hand, new conditions by which capital is enabled to give free scope to this its constant tendency, and on the other hand, new motives with which to whet capital's appetite for the labour of others.

        In the first place, in the form of machinery, the implements of labour become automatic, things moving and working independent of the workman. They are thenceforth an industrial perpetuum mobile, that would go on producing forever, did it not meet with certain natural obstructions in the weak bodies and the strong wills of its human attendants. The automaton, as capital, and because it is capital, is endowed, in the person of the capitalist, with intelligence and will; it is therefore animated by the longing to reduce to a minimum the resistance offered by that repellent yet elastic natural barrier, man. This resistance is moreover lessened by the apparent lightness of machine work and by the more pliant and docile character of the women and children employed on it. * * *

        Machinery produces relative surplus-value; not only by directly depreciating the value of labour-power, and by indirectly cheapening the same through cheapening the commodities that enter into its reproduction, but also, when it is first introduced sporadically into an industry, by converting the labour employed by the owner of that machinery, into labour of a higher degree and greater efficacy, by raising the social value of the article produced above its individual value, and thus enabling the capitalist to replace the value of a day's labour-power by a smaller portion of the value of a day's product. During this transition period, when the use of machinery is a sort of monopoly, the profits are therefore exceptional, and the capitalist endeavours to exploit thoroughly ""the sunny time of this his first love,"" by prolonging the working-day as much as possible. The magnitude of the profit whets his appetite for more profit.

        As the use of machinery becomes m ore general in a particular industry, the social value of the product sinks down to its individual value, and the law that surplus-value does not arise from the labour-power that has been replaced by the machinery, but from the labour-power actually employed in working with the machinery, asserts itself. Surplus-value arises from variable capital alone, and we saw that the amount of surplus-value depends on two factors, viz., the rate of surplus-value and the n umber of the workmen simultaneously employed. Given the length of the working-day, the rate of surplus-value is determined by the relative duration o f the necessary labour and of the surplus-labour in a day. The number of the labourers simultaneously employed depends, on its side, on the ratio of the variable to the constant capital. Now, however much the use of machinery may increase the surplus-labour at the expense of the necessary labour by heightening the productiveness of labour, it is clear that it attains this result, only by diminishing the number of workmen employed by a given amount of capital. It converts what was formerly variable capital, invested in labourpower, into machinery which, being constant capital, does not produce surplus-value. It is impossible, for instance, to squeeze as much surplus-value out of 2 as out of 24 labourers. If each of these 2.4 men gives only one hour of surplus-labour in 12, the: 1.4 men give together 24 hours of surplus-labour, while 24 hours is the total labour of the two men. Hence, the application of machinery to the production of surplus-value implies a contradiction which is immanent in it, since of the two factors of the surplus-value created by a given amount of capital, one, the rate of surplus-value, cannot be increased, except by diminishing the other, the number of workmen. This contradiction comes to light, as soon as by the general employment of machinery in a given industry, the value of the machine-produced commodity regulates the value of all commodities of the same sort; and it is this contradiction, that in its turn, drives the capitalist, without his being conscious of the fact, to excessive lengthening of the working-day, in order that he may compensate the decrease in the relative number of labourers exploited, by an increase not only of the relative, •but of the absolute surplus-labour.

        If , then, the capitalistic employment of machinery, on the one hand, supplies new and powerful motives to an excessive lengthening of the working-day, and radically changes, a s well the methods of labour, as also the character of the social working organism, in such a manner as to break down all opposition to this tendency, on the other hand it produces, partly by opening out to the capitalist new strata of the; working-class, previously inaccessible to him, partly by setting free the labourers it supplants, a surplus working population, which is compelled to submit to the dictation of capital. Hence that remarkable phenomenon in the history of Modern Industry, that machinery sweeps away every moral and natural restriction on the length of the working-day. Hence, too, the economic paradox, that the most powerful instrument for shortening labour-time, becomes the most unfailing means for placing every moment of the labourer's time and that of his family, at the disposal of the capitalist for the purpose of expanding the value of his capital. ""If,"" dreamed Aristotle, the greatest thinker of antiquity, ""if every tool, when summoned, or even of its own accord, could do the work that befits it, just as the creations of Dredalus moved of themselves, or the tripods of Hephrestos went of their own accord to their sacred work, if the weavers' shuttles were to weave of themselves, then there would be no need either of apprentices for the master workers, or of slaves for the lords."" And Antipatros, a Greek poet of the time of Cicero, hailed the invention of the water-wheel for grinding corn, an invention that is the elementary form of all machinery, as the giver of freedom to female slaves, and the bringer back of the golden age. Oh! Those heathens! They understood, as the learned Bastiat, and before him the still wiser MacCulloch have discovered, nothing of Political Economy and Christianity. They did not, for example, comprehend that machinery is the surest means of lengthening the working-day. They perhaps excused the slavery of one on the ground that it was a means to the full development of another. But to preach slavery of the masses, in order that a few crude and half-educated parvenus, might become ""eminen t spinners,"" ""extensive sausage-makers,"" and ""influential shoeblack dealers,"" to do this, they lacked the bump of Christianity.

                                  C. INTENSIFICATION OF LABOUR

        The immoderate lengthening of the working-day, produced by machinery in the hands of capital, leads to a reaction on the part of society, the very sources of whose life are menaced; and, thence, to a normal working-day whose length is fixed by law. Thenceforth a phenomenon that we have already met with, namely, the intensification of labour, develops into great importance. Our analysis of absolute surplus-value had reference primarily to the extension or duration of the labour, its intensity being assumed as given. We now proceed to consider the substitution of a more intensified labour for labour of more extensive duration, and the degree o f the former. * * *

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                          Section IV. The Factory

        At the commencement of this chapter we considered that which we may call the body of the factory, i.e., machinery organised into a system. We there saw how machinery, by annexing the labour of women and children, augments the number of human beings who form the material for capitalistic exploitation, how it confiscates the whole of the workman's disposable time, by immoderate extension of the hours of labour, and how finally its progress, which allows of enormous increase of production in shorter and shorter periods, serves as a means of systematically getting more work done in a shorter time, or of exploiting labour-power more intensely. We now turn to the factory as a whole, and that in its most perfect form. * * *

        So far as division of labour re-appears in the factory, it is primarily a distribution of the workmen among the specialized machines; and of masses of workmen, not however organised into groups, among the various departments of the-factory, in each of which they work at a number of similar machines placed together; their co-operation, therefore, is only simple. The organised group, peculiar to manufacture, is replaced by the connexion between the head workman and his few assistants. The essential division is, into work-men who are actually employed on the machines (among whom are included a few who look after the engine), and into mere attendants (almost exclusively children) of these workmen. Among the attendants are reckoned more or less all ""Feeders"" who supply the machines with the material to be worked. In addition to these two principal classes, there is a numerically unimportant class of persons, whose occupation it is to look after the whole of the machinery and repair it from time to time; such as engineers, mechanics, joiners, &c. This is a superior class of workmen, some of them scientifically educated, others brought up to a trade; it is distinct from the factory operative class, and merely aggregated to it . This division of labour is purely technical.

        To work at a machine, the workman should be taught from childhood, in order that he may learn to adapt his own movements to the uniform and unceasing motion of an automaton. When the machinery, as a whole, forms a system of manifold machines, working simultaneously and in concert, the co-operation based upon it, requires the distribution of various groups of workmen among the different kinds of machines. But the employment of machinery does away with the necessity of crystallising this distribution after the manner of Manufacture, by the constant annexation of a particular man to a particular function. Since the motion of the whole system does not proceed from the workman, but from the machinery, a change of persons can take place at any time without an interruption of the work. The most striking proof of this is afforded by the relays system, put into operation by the manufacturers 'during their revolt from 1848 to 1850. Lastly, the quickness with which machine work is learnt by young people does away with the necessity of bringing up for exclusive employment by machinery, a special class of operatives. With regard to the work of the mere attendants, it can, to some extent, be replaced in the mill by machines, and owing to its extreme simplicity, it allows of a rapid and constant change of the individuals burdened with this drudgery.

        Although then, technically speaking, the old system of division of labour is thrown overboard by machinery, it hangs on in the factory, as a traditional habit handed down from Manufacture, and is afterwards systematically re-moulded and established in a more hideous form by capital, as a means of exploiting labour-power. The life-long specialty of handling one and the same tool now becomes the life-long specialty of serving one and the same machine. Machinery is put to a wrong use, with the object of transforming the workman, from his very childhood, into a part of a detail-machine. In this way, not only are the expenses of his reproduction considerably lessened, but at the same time his helpless dependence upon the factory as a whole, and therefore upon the capitalist, is rendered complete. Here as everywhere else, we must distinguish between the increased productiveness due to the development of the social process of production, and that due to the capitalist exploitation of that process. In handicrafts and manufacture, the workman makes use of a tool in the factory the machine makes use of him. There the movements o f the instrument of labour proceed from him, here it is the movements of the machine that he must follow. In manufacture the workmen are parts of a living mechanism. In the factory we have a lifeless mechanism independent of the workman, who becomes its mere living appendage. ""The miserable routine of endless drudgery and toil in which the same mechanical process is gone through over and over again, is like the labour of Sisyphus. The burden of labour, like the rock, keeps ever falling back on the worn-out labourer.""2 At the same time that factory work exhausts the nervous system to the uttermost it does away with the many-sided play of the muscles, and confiscates every atom of freedom, both in bodily and intellectual activity. The lightening of the labour, even, becomes a sort of torture, since the machine does not free the labourer from work, but deprives the work of all interest. Every kind of capitalist production, in so far as it is not only a labour-process, but also a process of creating surplus-value, has this in common, that it is not the workman that employs the instruments of labour, but the instruments of labour that employ the workman. But it is only in the factory system that this inversion for the first time acquires technical and palpable reality. By means of its conversion into an automaton, the instrument of labour confronts the labourer, during the labour process, in the shape of capital, of dead labour, that dominates, and pumps dry, living labour-power. The separation of the intellectual powers of production from the manual labour, and the conversion of those powers into the might of capital over labour, is, as we have already shown, finally completed by modern industry erected on the foundation of machinery. The special skill of each individual insignificant factory operative vanishes as an infinitesimal quantity before the science, the gigantic physical forces, and the mass. Of labours that are embodied in the factory mechanism and, together with that mechanism, constitute the power of the ""master."" This ""master,"" therefore, in whose brain the machinery and his monopoly of it are inseparably united, whenever he falls out with his ""hands,"" contemptuously tells them: ""The factory operatives should keep in wholesome remembrance the fact that theirs is really a low species of skilled labour; and that there is none which is m ore easily acquired, or of its quality more amply remunerated, or which by a short training of the least expert can be m ore quickly, as well as abundantly, acquired . . . . The master's machinery really plays a far more important part in the business of production than the labour and the skill of the operative, which six months' education can teach, and a common labourer can learn."" The technical subordination of the workman to the uniform motion of the instruments of labour, and the peculiar composition of the body of work people, consisting as it does of individuals of both sexes and of all ages, give rise to a barrack discipline, which is elaborated into a complete system in the factory, and which fully develops the before mentioned labour of overlooking, thereby dividing the workpeople into operatives and over lookers, into private soldiers and sergeants of an industrial army . ""The main difficulty [in the automatic factory] . . . lay . . . above all in training human beings to renounce their desultory habits of work and to identify themselves with the unvarying regularity of the complex automaton. To devise and administer a successful code of factory discipline, suited to the necessities of factory diligence, was the Herculean enterprise, the noble achievement of Arkwright! Even at the present day, when the system is perfectly organised and its labour lightened to the utmost, it is found nearly impossible to convert persons past the age of puberty, into useful factory hands."" The factory code in which capital formulates, like a private legislator, and at his own good will, his autocracy over his workpeople, unaccompanied by that division of responsibility, in other matters so much approved of by the bourgeoisie, and unaccompanied by the still more approved representative system, this code is but the capitalistic caricature of that social regulation of the labour-process which becomes requisite in co-operation on a great scale, and in the employment in common, of instruments of labour and especially o f machinery. The place of the slave-driver's lash is taken by the over looker's book of penalties. All punishments naturally resolve themselves into fines and deductions from wages, and the law-giving talent o f the factory Lycurgus so arranges matters, that a violation of his laws is, if possible, more profitable to him than the keeping of them.

        We shall here merely allude to the material conditions under which factory labour is carried on. Every organ of sense is injured in an equal degree by artificial elevation of the temperature, by the dust-laden atmosphere, by the deaJening noise, not to mention danger to life and limb among the thickly crowded machinery, which, with the regularity of the seasons, issues its list of the killed and wounded in the industrial battle. Economy of the social means o f production, matured and forced as in a hothouse by the factory system, is turned, in the hands of capital, into systematic robbery of what is necessary for the life of the workman while he is at work, robbery of space, light, air, and of protection to his person against the dangerous and unwholesome accompaniments of the productive process, not to mention the robbery of appliances for the comfort of the workman. Is Fourier wrong when he calls factories ""tempered bagnos""?

                Section 5. The Strife Between Workman and Machine

        The contest between the capitalist and the wage-labourer dates back to the very origin of capital. It raged on throughout the whole manufacturing period. But only since the introduction of machinery has the workman fought against the instrument of labour itself, the material embodim ent of capital. He revolts against this particular form of the means of production, as being the material basis of the capitalist mode of production. * * *

Section 9. The Factory Acts. Sanitary and Educational Clauses of the Same.                                            Their General Extension in England

        Factory legislation, that first conscious and methodical reaction of society against the spontaneously developed form of the process of production, is, as we have seen, just as much the necessary product of modern industry as cotton yarn, self-actors, and the electric telegraph. Before passing to the consideration of the extension of that legislation in England, we shall shortly notice certain clauses contained in the Factory Acts, and not relating to the hours of work. Apart from their wording, which makes it easy for the capitalist to evade them, the sanitary clauses are extremely meagre, and, in fact, limited to provisions for whitewashing the walls, for insuring cleanliness in some other matters, for ventilation, and for protection against dangerous machinery. In the third book we shall return again to the fanatical opposition of the masters to those clauses which imposed upon them a slight expenditure on appliances for protecting the limbs of their workpeople, an opposition that throws a fresh and glaring light on the Free-trade dogma, according to which, in a society with conflicting interests, each individual necessarily furthers the common weal by seeking nothing but his own personal advantagel * * *

        Paltry as the education clauses of the Act appear on the whole, yet they proclaim elementary education to be an indispensable condition to the employment of children. The success of those clauses proved for the first time the possibility of combining education and gymnastics with manual labour, and, consequently, of combining manual labour with education and gymnastics. The factory inspectors soon found out by questioning the schoolmasters, that the factory children, although receiving only one half the education of the regular day scholars, yet learnt quite as much and often more. ""This can be accounted for by the simple fact that, with only being at school for one half o f the day, they are always fresh, and nearly always ready and willing to receive instruction. The system, on which they work, half manual labour, and half school, renders each employment a rest and a relief to the other; consequently, both are far more congenial to the child, - than would be the case were he kept constantly at one. It is quite clear that a boy who has been at school all the morning, cannot (in hot weather particularly) cope with one who comes fresh and bright from his work."" Further in formation on this point will be found in Senior's speech at the Social Science Congress a t Edinburgh in 1863. He there shows, amongst other things, how the monotonous and uselessly long school hours of the children of the upper and middle classes, uselessly add to the labour of the teacher, ""while he not only fruitlessly but absolutely injuriously, wastes the time, health, and energy of the children . "" From the Factory system budded, as Robert Owen has shown us in detail, the germ of the education of the future, an education that will, in the case of every child over a given age, combine productive labour with instruction and gymnastics, not only as one of the methods of adding to the efficiency of production, but as the only method of producing fully developed human beings.

        Modern Industry, as we have seen, sweeps away by technical means the manufacturing division of labour, under which each man is bound hand and foot for life to a single detail-operation. At the same time, the capitalistic form o f that industry reproduces this same division of labour in a still more monstrous shape; in the factory proper, by converting the workman into a living appendage of the machine; and everywhere outside the Factory, partly by the sporadic use of machinery and machine workers, partly by re-establishing the division of labour on a fresh basis by the general introduction of the labour of women and children, and of cheap unskilled labour.

        The antagonism between the manufacturing division of labour and the methods of Modern Industry makes itself forcibly felt. It manifests itself, amongst other ways, in the frightful fact that a great part of the children employed in modern factories and manufactures, are from their earliest years riveted to' the mast simple manipulations, and exploited far years, without being taught a single sort of work that would afterwards make them of use, even in the same manufactory or factory.

        Modern Industry never looks upon and treats the existing farm of a process as final. The technical basis of that industry is therefore revolutionary, while all earlier modes of production were essentially conservative. By means of machinery, chemical processes and other methods, it is continually causing changes not only in the technical basis of production, but also in the functions of the labourer, and in the social combinations of the labour-process. At the same time, it thereby also revolutionizes the division of labour within the society, and incessantly launches masses of capital and a f workpeople from one branch of production to' another. But if Modern Industry, by its very nature, therefore necessitates variation of labour, fluency of function, universal mobility of the labourer, on the other hand, in its capitalistic farm, it reproduces the old division of labour with its ossified particularisations. We have seen h aw this absolute contradiction between the technical necessities a f Modern Industry, a n d the social character inherent in its capitalistic farm, dispels all fixity and security in the situation of the labourer; haw it constantly threatens, by taking away the instruments of labour, to' snatch from his hands his means of subsistence, and, by suppressing his detail function, to' make him superfluous. We have seen, too, how this antagonism vents its rage in the creation of that monstrosity, an industrial reserve army, kept in misery in order to' be always at the disposal of capital; in the incessant human sacrifices from among the working-class, in the mast reckless squandering of labour-power, and in the devastation caused by a social anarchy which turns every economic progress into a social calamity. This is the negative side. But if, an the one hand, variation of work at present imposes itself after the manner of an overpowering natural law, and with the blindly destructive action of a natural law that meets with resistance at all paints, Modern Industry, on the other hand, through its catastrophes imposes the necessity of recognising, as a fundamental law of production, variation of work, consequently fitness of the labourer far varied work, consequently the greatest possible development of his varied aptitudes, It becomes a question of life and death far society to adapt the made of production to the normal functioning of this law. Modern Industry, indeed, compels society, under penalty of death, to' replace the detail-worker of to-day; crippled by life-long repetition of one and the same trivial operation, and thus reduced to' the mere fragment of a man, by the fully developed individual, fit for a variety of labours, ready to face any change of production, and to whom the different social functions h e performs, are but so many modes of giving free scope to his own natural and acquired powers.

        One step already spontaneously taken towards effecting this revolution is the establishment of technical and agricultural schools, and of ""ecoles d' enseignement professionnel,"" in which the children of the working-men receive some little instruction in technology and in the practical handling of the various implements of labour. Though the Factory Act, that first and meagre concession wrung from capital, is limited to combining elementary education with work in the factory, there can be no doubt that when the working-class comes into power, as inevitably it must, technical instruction, both theoretical and practical, will take its proper place i n the working class schools . There is also no doubt that such revolutionary ferments, the final result of which is the abolition of the old division of labour, are diametrically opposed to the capitalistic form of production, and to the economic status o f the labourer corresponding to that form. But the historical development of the antagonisms, immanent in a given form of production, is the only way in which that form o f production can be dissolved and a new form established. ""Ne sutor ultra crepidam""-this ne plus ultra of handicraft wisdom became sheer nonsense, from the moment the watchmaker Watt invented the steam-engine, the barber Arkwright, the throstle, and the working-jeweller, Fulton, the steamship.

        So long as Factory legislation is confined to regulating the labour in factories, manufactori es, &c., it is regarded as a mere interference with the exploiting rights of capital. But when it comes to regulating the so-called ""home-labour,"" it is immediately viewed as a direct attack on the patria potestas, on parental authority. The tender-hearted English Parliament long affected to shrink from taking this step. The force of facts, however, compelled it at last to acknowledge that modern industry, in overturning the economic foundation on which was based the traditional family, and the family labour corresponding to it, had also unloosened all traditional family ties. The rights of the children had to be proclaimed .The final report of the Ch. Empl. Comm. of 1866, states:"" It is unhappily, to a painful degree, apparent throughout the whole of the evidence, that against no persons do the children of both sexes so much require protection as against their parents."" The system of unlimited exploitation of children's labour in general and the so-called home-labour in particular is ""maintained only because the parents are able, without check or control, to exercise this arbitrary and mischievous power over their young a n d tender offspring. . . . Parents must not possess the absolute power of making their children mere 'machines to earn so much weekly wage.' . . . The children and young persons, therefore, in all such cases may justifiably claim from the legislature, as a natural right, that an exemption should be secured to them, from what destroys prematurely their physical strength, and lowers them in the scale of intellectual and moral beings."" It was not, however, the misuse of parental authority that created the capitalistic exploitation, whether direct or indirect, of children's labour; but, on the contrary, it was the capitalistic mode of exploitation which, by sweeping away the economic basis of parental authority, made its exercise degenerate into a mischievous misuse of power. However terrible and disgusting the dissolution, under the capitalist system, of the old family ties may appear, nevertheless, modern industry, by assigning as it does an important part in the process of production, outside the domestic sphere, to women, to young persons, and to children of both sexes, creates a new economic foundation for a higher form of the family and o f the relations between the sexes. It is , o f course, just as absurd t o hold the Teutonic-Christian form o f the family t o be absolute and final as it would be to apply that character to the ancient Roman, the ancient Greek, o r the Eastern forms which, moreover, taken together form a series in historical development. Moreover, it is obvious that the fact of the collective working group being composed of individuals of both sexes and all ages, must necessarily, under suitable conditions, become a source of humane development; although in its spontaneously developed, brutal, capitalistic form, where the labourer exists for the process of production, and not the process of production for the labourer, that fact is a pestiferous source of corruption and slavery. "". "". "".

                         Section 10. Modern Industry and Agriculture

        The revolution called forth by modern industry in agriculture, and m the social relations of agricultural producers will be in vestigated later on. In this place we shall merely indicate a few results by way of anticipation. If the use of machinery in agriculture is for the most part free from the injurious physical effect it has on the factory operative, its action in superseding the labourers is more intense, and finds less resistance, as we shall see later in detail. In the counties of Cambridge and Suffolk, for example, the area of cultivated land has extended very much within the last twenty years (up to 1868), while m the same period the rural population has diminished, not only relatively, but absolutely. In the United States it is as yet only virtually that agricultural machines replace labourers; in other words, they allow of the cultivation by the farmer of a larger surface, but do not actually expel the labourers employed. In 1861 the number of persons occupied in England and Wales in the manufacture of agricultural machines was 1,034, whilst the number of agricultural labourers employed in the use of agricultural machines and steam-engines did not exceed 1,205.

        In the sphere of agriculture, modern industry has a more revolutionary effect than elsewhere, for this reason, that it annihilates the peasant, that bulwark of the old society, and replaces him by the wage-labourer. Thus the desire for social changes and the class antagonisms are brought to the same level in the country as in the town s. The irrational, old-fashioned methods of agriculture are replaced by scientific ones. Capitalist production completely tears asunder the old bond of union which held together agriculture and manufacture in their infancy. But at the same time it creates the material conditions for a higher synthesis in the future, viz., the union of agriculture and industry o n the basis of the more perfected forms they have each acquired during their temporary separation . Capitalist production, b y collecting the population in great centres, and causing an ever-increasing preponderance of town population, on the one hand concentrates the historical motive power of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the circulation of matter between man and the soil, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing; it therefore violates the conditions necessary to lasting fertility of the soil. By this action it destroys at the same time the health of the town labourer and the intellectual life of the rural labourer. But while upsetting the naturally grown conditions for the maintenance of that circulation of matter, it imperiously calls for its restoration as a system, as a regulating law of social production, and under a form appropriate to the full development of the human race. In agriculture as in manufacture, the transformation of production under the sway of capital, means, at the same time, the martyrdom of the producer; the instrument of labour becomes the means of enslaving, exploiting, and impoverishing the labourer; the social combination and organisation of labour-processes is turned into an organized mode of crushing out the workman's individual vitality, freedom, and independence. The dispersion of the rural labourers over larger areas breaks their power of resistance while concentration increases that of the town operatives. In modern agriculture, as in the urban industries, the increased productiveness and quantity of the labour set in motion are bought at the cost of laying waste and consuming by disease labour-power itself. Moreover, all progress in capitalistic agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the labourer, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility o f the soil for a given time, is a progress towards ruining the lasting sources of that fertility. The more a country starts its development on the foundation of modern industry, like the United States, for example, the more rapid is this process of destruction. Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth-the soil and the labourer.

        Part V. The Production of Absolute and of Relative Surplus-Value
          CHAPTER XVI. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE SURPLUS-VALUE

        In considering the labour-process, we began by treating it in the abstract, apart from its historical forms, as a process between man and Nature. We stated: ""If we examine the whole labour-process, from the p oint of view of its result, it is plain that both the instruments and the subjects of labour are means of production, and that the labour itself is productive labour."" And we further added: ""This method of determining, from the standpoint of the labourp rocess alone, what is productive labour, is by no means directly applicable to the case of the capitalist process of production."" We now proceed to the further development of this subject.

        So far as the labour-process is purely individual, one and the same labourer unites in himself all the functions, that later on become separated. When an individual appropriates natural objects for his livelihood, no one controls him but himself. Afterwards he is controlled by others. A single man cannot operate upon Nature without calling his own muscles into play under the control of his own brain. As in the natural body head and hand wait upon each other, so the labour-process unites the labour of the hand with that of the head. Later on they part company and even become deadly foes. The product ceases to be the direct product of the individual, and becomes a social product, produced in common by a co]lecture labourer, i.e. , by a combination of workmen, each of whom takes only a part, greater or less, in the manipulation of the subject of their labour. As the co-operative character of the labour-process becomes more and more marked, so, as a necessary consequence, does our notion of productive labour, and of its agent the productive labourer, become extended. In order to labour productively, it is n o longer necessary for y o u to do manual work yourself; enough, if you are an organ of the collective labourer, and perform one of its subordinate functions. The first definition given above of productive labour, a definition deduced from the very nature of the production of material objects, still remains correct for the collective labourer, considered as a whole. But it no longer holds good for each member taken individually.

        On the other hand, however, our notion of productive labour becomes narrowed. Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities it is essentially the production of surplus-value. The labourer produces, not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices therefore, that he should simply produce. He must produce surplus-value. That labourer alone is productive, who produces surplus-value for the capitalist, and thus works for the self expansion of capital. If we may take an example from outside the sphere of production of material objects a schoolmaster is a productive labourer, when, in addition to be labouring the heads of his scholars, he works like a horse to enrich the school proprietor. That the latter has laid out his capital in a teaching factory, instead of in a sausage factory, does not alter the relation. Hence the notion of a productive labourer implies not merely a relation between work and useful effect, between labourer and product of labour, but also a specific, social relation of production, a relation that has sprung up historically and stamps the labourer as the direct means of creating surplus-value. To be a productive labourer is, therefore, not a piece of luck, but a misfortune. * * *

        The prolongation of the working-day beyond the point at which the labourer would have produced just an equivalent for the value of his labour-power, and the appropriation of that surplus-labour by capital, this is production of absolute surplus-value. It forms the general groundwork of the capitalist system, and the starting-point for the production of relative surplus-value. The latter pre-supposes that the working-day is already divided into two parts, necessary labour, and surplus-labour. In order to prolong the surplus-labour, the necessary labour is shortened by methods whereby the equivalent for the wages is produced in less time. The production of absolute surplus-value turns exclusively upon the length of the working- day; the production of relative surplus-value, revolutionises out and out the technical processes of labour, and the composition of society. It therefore pre-supposes a specific mode, the capitalist mode of production, a mode which, along with its methods, •means, and conditions, arises and develops itself spontaneously on the foundation afforded by the formal subjection of labour to capital. In the course of this development, the formal subjection is replaced by the real subjection of labour to capital. * * *

        From one standpoint, any distinction between absolute and relative surplus-value appears illusory. Relative surplus-value is absolute, since it compels the absolute prolongation o f the working-day beyond the labour-time necessary to the existence of the labourer himself. Absolute surplus-value is relative, since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness of labour, as will allow of the necessary labour-time being confined to a portion of the working- day. But if we keep in mind the behaviour of surplus-value, this appearance of identity vanishes. Once the capitalist mode of production established and become general, the difference between absolute and relative surplus-value makes itself felt, wherever there is a question of raising the rate of surplus-value. Assuming that labour-power is paid for at its value, we are confronted by this alternative : given the productiveness of labour and its normal intensity, the rate of surplus-value can be raised only by the actual prolongation of the working-day; on the other hand, given the length of the working-day, that rise can be effected only by a change in the relative magnitudes of the components of the working-day, viz., necessary labour and surplus-labour; a change which, if the wages are not to fall below the value of labour-power, pre-supposes a change either in the productiveness or in the intensity of the labour. If the labourer wants all his time to produce the necessary means of subsistence for himself and his race, he has no time left in which to work gratis for others. Without a certain degree of productiveness in his labour, he has no such superfluous time at his disposal; without such superfluous time, no surplus labour, and therefore no capitalists, no slave-powers, no feudal lords, in one word, no class of large proprietors. * * *

    CHAPTER XXV. THE GENERAL LAW OF CAPITALIST ACCUMULATION
    Section 1. The Increased Demand for Labour-Power That Accompames
            Accumulation, the Composition of Capital Remaining the Same

        In this chapter we consider the influence of the growth of capital on the lot of the labouring class. The most important factor in this enquiry, Is the composition of capital and the changes it undergoes m the course of the process of accumulation.

        The composition of capital is to be understood in a two-fold sense. On the side of value, it is determined by the proportion in which it is divided into constant capital or value of the means of production, and variable capital or value of labour-power, the sum total of wages. On the side of material, as it functions in the process of production, all capital is divided into means of production and living labour-power. This latter composition is determined by the relation between the mass of the means of production employed, on the one hand, and the mass of labour necessary for their employment on the other. I call the former the value-composition, the latter the technical composition of capital. Between the two there is a strict correlation. To express this, I call the value-composition of capital, in so 'far as it is determined by its technical composition and mirrors the changes of the latter, the organic composition of capital. Wherever I refer to the composition of capital, without further qualification, its organic composition is always understood.

        The many individual capitals invested in a particular branch of production have, one with another, more or less different compositions. The average of the individual compositions gives us the composition of the total capital in this branch of production. Lastly, the average of these averages, in all branches of production, gives us the composition of the total social capital of a country, and with this alone are we, in the last resort, concerned in the following investigation.

        Growth of capital involves growth 0-£ its variable constituent or of the part invested in labour-power. A part of the surplus-value turned into additional capital must always be re-transformed into variable capital, or additional labour-fund. If we suppose that, all other circumstances remaining the same, the composition of capital also remains constant (i.e., that a definite mass of means of production constantly needs the same mass of labour-power to set it in motion), then the demands for labour and the subsistence-fund of the labourers clearly increase in the same proportion as the capital, and the more rapidly, the more rapidly the capital increases. Since the capital produces yearly a surplus-value, of which one part is yearly added to the original capital; since this increment itself grows yearly along with the augmentation of the capital already functioning; since lastly, under special stimulus to enrichment, such as the opening of new markets, or of new spheres for the outlay of capital in consequence of newly developed social wants, &c., the scale of accumulation may be suddenly extended, merely by a change in the division of the surplus-value or surplus-product into capital and revenue, the requirements of accumulating capital may exceed the increase of labour-power or of the number of labourers; the demand for labourers may exceed the supply, and, therefore, wages may rise. This must, indeed, ultimately be the case if the conditions supposed above continue. For since in each year more labourers are employed than in its predecessor, sooner or later a point must be reached, at which the requirements of accumulation begin to surpass the customary supply of labour, and, therefore, a rise of wages takes place. A lamentation on this score was heard in England during the whole of the fifteenth, and the first half of the eighteenth centuries. The more or less favourable circumstances in which the wage-working class supports and multiplies itself, in no way alter the fundamental character o f capitalist production. As simple reproduction constantly reproduces the capital-relation itself, i.e., the relation of capitalists on the one hand, and wage-workers on the other, so reproduction on a progressive scale, i.e., accumulation, reproduces the capital-relation on a progressive scale, more capitalists or larger capitalists at this pole, more wage-workers at that. The reproduction of a mass of labour-power, which must incessantly re-incorporate itself with capital for that capital's selfexpansion; which cannot get free from capital, and whose enslavement to capital is only concealed by the variety of individual capitalists to whom it sells itself, this reproduction of labour-power forms, in fact, an essential of the reproduction o f capital itself. Accumulation of cap ital is, therefore, increase of the proletariat.  * * *

        The law of capitalist production, that is at the bottom of the pretended ""natural law of population ,"" reduces itself simply to this: The correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital, and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this additional capital. It is therefore in no way a relation between two magnitudes, independent one of the other: on the one hand, the magnitude of the capital; on the other, the number of the labouring population; it is rather, at bottom, only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same labouring population. If the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working-class, and accumulated by the capitalist class; increases so rapidly that its conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour, then wages rise, and, all other circumstances remaining equal, the unpaid labour diminishes in proportion . But as soon as this diminution touches the point at which the surplus-labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity, a reaction sets in: a smaller part of revenue is capitalised, accumulation lags, and the movement of rise in wages receives a check. The rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only leave intact the foundations o f the capitalistic system, but also secure its reproduction on a progressive scale. The law of capitalistic accumulation, metamorphosed by economists into a pretended law of Nature, in reality merely states that the very nature of accumulation excludes every diminution in the degree of exploitation of labour, and every rise in the price of labour, which could seriously imperil the continual reproduction, on an ever-enlarging scale, of the capitalistic relation . It cannot be otherwise in a mode of production in which the la bourer exists to satisfy the needs of self-expansion of existing values, instead of, on the contrary, material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer. As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.

Section 3. Progressive Production of a Relative Surplus-Population or                                                        Industrial Reserve Army

        The accumulation of capital, though originally appearing as its quantitative extension only, is effected, as we have seen, under a progressive qualitative change in its composition, under a constant increase of its constant, at the expense of its variable constituent.

                                                       * * *

        * * * With the growth of the total capital, its variable constituent or the labour incorporated in it, also does increase, but in a constantly diminishing proportion. The intermediate pauses are shortened, in which accumulation works as simple extension of production, on a given technical basis. It is not merely that an accelerated accumulation of total capital, accelerated in a constantly growing progression, is needed to absorb an additional number of labourers, or even, on account of the constant metamorphosis of old capital, to keep employed those already functioning. In its turn, this increasing accumulation and centralisation becomes a source of new changes in the composition of capital, of a more accelerated diminution of its variable, as compared with its constant constituent. This accelerated relative diminution of the variable constituent that goes along with the accelerated increase of the total capital, and moves more rapidly than this increase, takes the inverse form, at the other pole, of an apparently absolute increase of the laboring population, an increase always moving more rapidly than that of the variable capital or the means of employment. But in fact, it is capitalistic accumulation itself that constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant population of labourers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the self-expansion of capital, and therefore a surplus-population.

                                                       * * *>

        * * * The labouring population therefore produces, along with the accumulation of capital produced by it, the means by which itself is made relatively superfluous, is turned into a relative surplus population; and it does this to an always increasing extent. This is a law of population peculiar to the capitalist mode of production; and in fact every special historic mode of production has its own special laws of population, historically valid within its limits alone. An abstract law of population exists for plants and animals only, and only in so far as man has not interfered with them.

        But if a surplus labouring population is a necessary product of accumulation or of the development of wealth on a capitalist basis, this surplus-population becomes, conversely, the lever of capitalistic accumulation, nay, a condition of existence of the capitalist mode of production. It forms a disposable industrial reserve army, that belongs to capital quite as absolutely as if the latter had bred it at its own cost. Independently of the limits of the actual increase of population, it creates, for the changing needs of the self-expansion of capital, a mass of human material always ready for exploitation. With accumulation, and the development of the productiveness of labour that accompanies it, the power of sudden expansion of capital grows also; it grows, not merely because the elasticity of the capital already functioning increases, not merely because the absolute wealth of society expands, of which capital only forms an elastic part, not merely because credit, under every special stimulus, at once places an unusual part of this wealth at the disposal of production in the form of additional capital; it grows, also, because the technical conditions of the process of production themselves machinery, means of transport, &c.-now admit of the rapidest transformation of masses of surplus-product into additional means of production. The mass of social wealth, overflowing with the advance of accumulation, and transformable into additional capital, thrusts itself frantically into old branches of production, whose market suddenly expands, or into newly formed branches, such as railways, &c . , the need for which grows out of the development of the old ones. In all such cases, there must be the possibility of throwing great masses of men suddenly on the decisive points without injury to the scale of production in other spheres. Overpopulation supplies these masses. The course characteristic of modern industry, viz ., a decennial cycle ( interrupted by smaller oscillations), of periods of average activity, production at high pressure, crisis and stagnation, depends on the constant formation, the greater or less absorption, and the re-formation of the industrial reserve army or surplus-population. In their turn, the varying phases of the industrial cycle recruit the surplus-population, and become one of the most energetic agents of its reproduction. This peculiar course of modern industry, which occurs in no earlier period of human history, was also impossible in the childhood of capitalist production. The composition of capital changed but very slowly. With its accumulation, therefore, there kept pace, on the whole, a corresponding growth in the demand for labour. Slow as was the advance of accumulation compared with that of more modern times, it found a check in the natural limits of the exploitable labouring population, limits which could only be got rid of by forcible means to be mentioned later. The expansion by fits and starts of the scale of production is the preliminary to its equally sudden contraction; the latter again evokes the former, but the former is impossible without disposable human material, without an increase in the number of labourers independently of the absolute growth of the population. This increase is effected by the simple process that constantly ""sets free"" a part of the labourers; by methods which lessen the numoer of labourers employed in proportion to the increased production. The whole form of the movement of modern industry depends, therefore, upon the constant transformation of a part of the labouring population into unemployed or half-employed hands.

        * * * Even Malthus recognises over-population as a necessity of modern industry, though, after his narrow fashion, he explains it by the absolute over-growth of the labouring population, not by their becoming relatively supernumerary. He says ""Prudential habits with regard to marriage, carried to a considerable extent among the labouring class of a country mainly depending upon manufactures and commerce, might injure it. . . . From the nature of a population, an increase of labourers cannot be brought into 'market in consequence of a particular demand till after the lapse of sixteen or eighteen years, and the conversion of revenue into capital, by saving, may take place much more rapidly; a country is always liable to an increase in the quantity of the funds for the maintenance of labour faster than the increase of population. "" 3 After Political Economy has thus demonstrated the constant production of a relative surplus-population of labourers to be a necessity of capitalistic accumulation, she very aptly, in the guise of an old maid, puts in the mouth of her beau ideal of a capitalist the following words addressed to those supernumeraries thrown on the streets by their own creation of additional capital : -""We manufacturers do what we can for you, whilst we are increasing that capital on which you must subsist, and you must do the rest by accommodating your numbers to the means of subsistence.""

        Capitalist production can by no means content itself with the quantity of disposable labour-power which the natural increase of population yields. It requires for its free play an industrial reserve army independent of these natural limits.

        Upto this point it has been assumed that the increase or diminution of the variable capital corresponds rigidly with the increase or diminution of the number of labourers employed.

        The number of labourers commanded by capital may remain the same, or even fall, while the variable capital increases. This is the case if the individual labourer yields m ore labour, and therefore his wages increase, and this although the price of labour remains the same or even falls, only more slowly than the mass of labour rises. Increase of variable capital, in this case, becomes an index of more labour, but not of more labourers employed. It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same . In the latter case, the outlay of constant capital increases in proportion to the mass of labour set in action; in the former that increase is much smaller. The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital.

        We have seen that the development o f the capitalist mode of production and of the productive power of labour-at once the cause and effect of accumulation-enables the capitalist, with the same outlay of variable capital, to set in action more labour by greater exploitation (extensive or intensive) of each individual labour-power. We have further seen that the capitalist buys with the same capital a greater mass of labour-power, as he progressively replaces skilled labourers by less skilled, mature labour-power by immature, male by female, that of adults by that of young persons or children.

        On the one hand, therefore, with the progress of accumulation, a larger variable capital sets more labour in action without enlisting more labourers; on the other, a variable capital of the same magnitude sets in action more labour with the same mass of labour-power; and finally, a greater number of inferior labour-powers by displacement of higher.

        The production of a relative surplus-population, or the setting free of labourers, goes on therefore yet more rapidly than the technical revolution of the process of production that accompanies, and is accelerated by, the advance of accumulation; and more rapidly than the corresponding diminution of the variable part of capital as compared with the constant. If the means of production, as they increase in extent and effective power, become to a less extent means of employment of labourers, this state of things is again modified by the fact that in proportion as the productiveness of labour increases, capital increases its supply of labour more quickly than its demand for labourers. The overwork of the employed part of the working-class swells the ranks of the reserve, whilst conversely the greater pressure that the latter by its competition exerts on the former, forces these to submit to over-work and to subjugation under the dictates of capital. The condemnation of one part of the working-class to enforced idleness by the over-work of the other part; and the converse, becomes a means of enriching the individual capitalists, and accelerates at the same time the production of the industrial reserve army on a scale corresponding with the advance of social accumulation. How important is this element in the formation of the relative surplus-population, is shown by the example of England. Her technical means for saving labour are colossal. Nevertheless, if tomorrow morning labour generally were reduced to a rational amount, and proportioned to the different sections of the working-class according to age and sex, the working population to hand would be absolutely insufficient for the carrying on of national production on its present scale. The great majority of the labourers now ""unproductive"" would have to be turned into ""productive"" ones.

        Taking them as a whole, the general movements of wages are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle. They are, therefore, not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population, but by the varying proportions in which the working-class is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus-population, by the extent to which it is now absorbed, now set free. For Modern Industry with its decennial cycles and periodic phases, which, moreover, as accumulation advances, are complicated by irregular oscillations following each other more and more quickly, that would indeed be a beautiful law, which pretends to make the action of capital dependent on the absolute variation of the population, instead of regulating the demand and supply of labour by the alternate expansion and con-traction of capital, the labour-market now appearing relatively under-full, because capital -is expanding, now again over-full, because it is contracting. Yet this is the dogma of the economists. According to them, wages rise in consequence of accumulation of capital. The higher wages stimulate the working population to more rapid multiplication, and this goes on until the labour market becomes too full, and therefore capital, relatively to the supply of labour, becomes insufficient. Wages fall, and now we have the reverse of the medal. The working population is little by little decimated as the result of the fall in wages, so that capital is again in excess relatively to them, or, as others explain it, falling wages and the corresponding increase in the exploitation of the labourer again accelerates accumulation, whilst, at the same time, the lower wages hold the increase of the working-class in check. Then comes again the time, when the supply of labour is less than the demand, wages rise, and so on. A beautiful mode of motion this for developed capitalist production! Before, in consequence of the rise of wages, any positive increase of the population really fit for work could occur, the time would have been passed again and again, during which the industrial campaign must have been carried through, the battle fought and won.

                                                       * * *

        The industrial reserve army, during the periods of stagnation and average prosperity, weighs down the active labour-army; during the periods of over-production and paroxysm, it holds its pretensions in check. Relative surplus-population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works. It confines the field of action of this law within the limits absolutely convenient to the activity of exploitation and to the domination of capital.

        This is the place to return to one of the grand exploits of economic apologetics. It will be remembered that if through the introduction of new, or the extension of old, machinery, a portion of variable capital is transformed into constant, the economic apologist interprets this operation which ""fixes"" capital and by that very act sets labourers ""free ,"" in exactly the opposite way, pretending that it sets free capital for the labourers. Only now can one fully understand the effrontery of these apologists. What are set free are not only the labourers immediately turned out by the machines, but also their future substitutes in the rising generation, and the additional contingent, that with the usual extension of trade on the old basis would be regularly absorbed.         They are now all ""set free,"" and every new bit of capital looking out for employment can dispose of them. Whether it attracts them or others, the effect on the general labour demand will be nil, if this capital is just sufficient to take out of the market as many labourers as the machines threw upon it. If it employs a smaller number, that of the supernumeraries increases; if it employs a greater, the general demand for labour only increases to the extent of the excess of the employed over those ""set free."" The impulse that additional capital, seeking an outlet, would otherwise have given to the general demand for labour, is therefore in every case neutralised to the extent of the labourers thrown out of employment by the machine. That is to say, the mechanism of capitalistic production so manages matters that the absolute increase of capital is accompanied by no corresponding rise in the general demand for labour,  And this apologist calls a compensation for the misery, the sufferings, the possible death of the displaced labourers during the transition period that banishes them into the industrial reserve army! The demand for labour is not identical with increase of capital, nor supply of labour with increase of the working-class. It is not a case of two independent forces working on one another. Les des sont pipes. Capital works on both sides at the same time. If its accumulation, on the one hand, increases the demand for labour, it increases on the other the supply of labourers by the ""setting free"" of them, whilst at the same time the pressure of the unemployed compels those that are employed to furnish more laboured therefore makes the supply of labour, to a certain extent, independent of the supply of labourers. The action of the law of supply and demand of labour on this basis completes the despotism of capital. As soon, therefore, as the labourers learn the secret, how it comes to pass that in the same • measure as they work more, as they produce more wealth for others, and as the productive power of their labour increases, so in the same measure even their function as a means of the self-expansion of capital becomes more and more precarious for them; as soon as they discov.er that the degree of intensity of the competition among themselves depends wholly on the pressure of the relative surplus-population; as soon as, by Trades' Unions, &c., they try to organize a regular .co operation between employed and unemployed in order to destroy or to weaken the ruinous effects of this natural law of capitalistic production on their class, so soon capital and its sycophant, Political Economy, cry out at the infringement of the ""eternal"" and so to say ""sacred"" law of supply and demand. Every combination of employed and en employed disturbs the ""harmonious"" action of this law. But, on the other hand, as soon as (in the colonies, e.g.) adverse circumstances prevent the creation of an industrial reserve army and, with it, the absolute dependence of the working-class upon the capitalist class, capital, along with its commonplace Sancho Panza, rebels against the ""sacred"" law of supply and demand, and tries to check its inconvenient action by forcible means and State interference.

               Section 4. Different Forms of the Relative Surplus-Population.

                        The General Law of Capitalistic Accumulation

        The relative surplus-population exists in every possible form. Every labourer belongs to it during the time when he is only partially employed or wholly unemployed. Not taking into account the great periodically recurring forms that the changing phases of the industrial cycle impress on it, now an acute form during the crisis, then again a chronic form during dull times-it has always three forms, the floating, the latent, and the stagnant. * * *

        The lowest sediment of the relative surplus-population finally dwells in the sphere of pauperism. Exclusive of vagabonds, criminals, prostitutes, in a word, the ""dangerous"" classes, this layer of society consists of three categories. First, those able to work one need only glance superficially at the statistics of English pauperism to find that the quantity of paupers increases with every crisis, and diminishes with every revival of trade. Second, orphans and pauper children, these are candidates for the industrial reserve army, and are, in times of great prosperity, as 1860, e.g., speedily and in large numbers enrolled in the active army of labourers. Third, the demoralised and ragged, and those unable to work, chiefly people who succumb to their incapacity for adaptation, due to the division of labour; people who have passed the normal age of the labourer; the victims of industry, whose number increases with the increase of dangerous machinery, of mines, chemical works, &c., the mutilated, the sickly, the widows, &c.. Pauperism is the hospital of the active labour-army and the dead weight of the industrial reserve army. Its production is included in that of the relative surplus population, its necessity in theirs; along with the surplus population, pauperism forms a condition of capitalist production, and of the capitalist development of wealth. It enters into the faux frais of capitalist production; but capital knows how to throw these, for the most part, from its own shoulders on to those of the working- class and the lower middle class.

        The greater the social wealth, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour, the greater is the industrial reserve army. The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital, develop also the labour-power a t its disposal. The relative mass of the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth. But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour-army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus-population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive, finally, the lazarus-layers of the working-class, and the industrial reserve army, the greater are official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation. Like all other laws it is modified in its working by many circumstances, the analysis of which does not concern us here.

        The folly is now patent of the economic wisdom that preaches to the labourers the accommodation of their number to the requirements of capital. The mechanism of capitalist production and accumulation constantly effects this adjustment. The first word of this adaptation is the creation of a relative surplus-population, or industrial reserve army. Its last word is the misery of constantly extending strata of the active army of labour, and the dead weight of pauperism.

        The law by which a constantly increasing quantity of means of production, thanks to the advance in the productiveness of social labour, may be set in movement by a progressively diminishing expenditure of human power, this law, in a capitalist society where the labourer does not employ the means of production, but the means of production employ the labourer-undergoes a complete inversion and is expressed thus : the higher the productiveness of labour, the greater is the pressure of the labourers on the means of employment, the more precarious, therefore, becomes their condition of existence, viz., the sale of their own labour-power for the increasing of another's wealth, or for the self-expansion of capital. The fact that the means of production and the productiveness of labour, increase more rapidly than the productive population, expresses itself; therefore, capitalistically in the inverse form that the labouring population always increases more rapidly than the conditions under which capital can employ this increase for its own self-expansion.

        We saw in Part IV., when analysing the production of relative surplus-value : within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer; all means for the development o f production transform themselves into means of domination over, and exploitation of, the producers; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man, degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine, destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil; they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour-process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as an independent power; they distort the conditions under which he works, subject him during the labour-process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness; they transform his life-time into working-time, and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital. But all methods for the production of surplus-value are at the same time methods of accumulation; and every extension of accumulation becomes again a means for the development of those methods. It follows therefore that in proportion as capital accumulates, the lot of the labourer is his payment high or low must grow worse. The law, finally, that always equilibrates the relative surplus-population, or industrial reserve army, to the extent and energy of accumulation, this law rivets the labourer to capital more firmly than the wedges of Vulcan did Prometheus to the rock. It establishes an accumulation of misery, corresponding with accumulation of capital. Accumulation of wealth at one pole is, therefore, at the same time accumulation of misery, agony of toil, slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole, i.e., on the side of the class that produces its own product in the form of capital. * * *

                   Part VIII. The So-Called Primitive Accumulation

        CHAPTER XXVI. THE SECRET OF PRIMITIVE ACCUMULATION

        We have seen how money is changed into capital; how through capital surplus-value is made, and from surplus-value more capital. But the accumulation of capital pre-supposes surplus-value; surplus-value pre-supposes capitalistic production; capitalistic production pre-supposes the pre-existence of considerable masses of capital and of labour-power in the hands of producers of commodities. The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation ( previous accumulation of Adam Smith ) preceding capitalistic accumulation; a n accumulation not the result of the capitalist mode of production but its starting point.

        This primitive accumulation plays in Political Economy about the same part as original sin in theology. Adam bit the apple, and thereupon sin fell on the human race. Its origin is supposed to be explained when it is told as an anecdote of the past. In times long gone by there were two sorts of people; one, the diligent, intelligent, and above all, frugal elite; the other, lazy rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living. The legend of theological original sin tells us certainly how man came to be condemned to eat his bread in the sweat of his b row; but the history of economic original sin reveals to us that there are people to whom this is by no means essential. Never mind! Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that, despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to us in the defence of property. M. Thiers, e.g., had the assurance to repeat it with all the solemnity of a statesman, to the French people, once so spiritual. But as soon as the question of property crops up, it becomes a sacred duty to proclaim the intellectual food of the infant as the one thing fit for all ages and for all stages of development. In actual history it is notorious that conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, briefly force play the great part. In the tender annals of Political Economy, the idyllic reigns from time immemorial. Right and ""labour"" were from all time the sole means of enrichment, the present year of course always excepted. As a matter of fact, the methods of primitive accumulation are anything but idyllic.

        In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are the means of production and of subsistence. They want transforming into capital. But this transformation itself can only take place under certain circumstances that centre in this, viz., that two very different kinds of commodity-possessors must come face to face and into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of production , means of subsistence, who are eager to increase the sum of values they possess, by buying other people's labour-power; on the other hand, free labourers, the sellers of their own labour-power, and therefore the sellers of labour. Free labourers, in the double - sense that neither they themselves form part and parcel of the means of production, as in the case of slaves, bondsmen, &c., nor d o the means of production belong to them , as in the case of peasant-proprietors; they are, therefore, free from, unencumbered by, any means of production of their own. With this polarization of the market for commodities, the fundamental conditions of capitalist production are given. The capitalist system presupposes the complete separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which they can realise their labour. As soon as capitalist production is once on its own legs, it not only maintains this separation, but reproduces it on a continually extending scale. The process, therefore, that clears the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his means of production; a process that transforms, on the one hand, the social means of subsistence and of production into capital, on the other, the immediate producers into wage-labourers . The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it.

        The economic structure of capitalistic society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society. The dissolution of the latter set free the elements of the former.

        The immediate producer, the labourer, could only dispose of his own person after he had ceased to be attached to the soil and ceased to be the slave, serf, or bondman of another. To become a free seller of labour-power, who carries his commodity wherever he finds a market, he must further have escaped from the regime of the guilds, their rules for apprentices and journeymen, and the impediments of their labour regulations. Hence, the historical movement which changes the producers into wage-workers appears, on the one hand, as their emancipation from serfdom and from the fetters of the guilds, and this side alone exists for our bourgeois historians. But, on the other hand, these new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of all the guarantees of existence afforded by the old feudal arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and fire.

        The industrial capitalists, these new potentates, had on their part not only to displace the guild masters of handicrafts, but also the feudal lords, the possessors of the sources of wealth. In this respect their conquest of social power appears as the fruit of a victorious struggle both against feudal lordship and its revolting prerogatives, and against the guilds and the fetters they laid on the free development of production and the free exploitation of man by man. The chevaliers d 'industrie, however, only succeeded in supplanting the chevaliers of the sword by making use of events of which they themselves were wholly innocent. They have risen by means as vile as those by which the Roman freedman once o n a time made himself the master of his patronus.

        The starting-point of the development that gave rise to the wage-labourer as well as to the capitalist was the servitude of the labourer. The advance consisted in a change of form of this servitude, in the transformation of feudal exploitation into capitalist exploitation. To understand its march, we need not go back very far. Although we come across the first beginnings of capitalist production as early as the 14th or 15th century, sporadically, in certain towns of the Mediterranean, the capitalistic era dates from the"" 16th century. Wherever it appears, the abolition of serfdom has been long effected, and the highest development of the middle ages, the existence of sovereign towns, has been long on the wane.

        In the history of primitive accumulation, all revolutions are epoch-making that act as levers for the capitalist class in course of formation; but, above all, those moments when great masses o f men a re suddenly and forcibly torn from their means of subsistence, and hurled as free and ""unattached"" proletarians on the labour-market. The expropriation of the agricultural producer, of the peasant, from the soil, is the basis of the whole process. The history of this expropriation, in different countries, assumes different aspects, and runs through its various phases in different orders of succession, and at different periods. In England alone, which we take as our example, has it the classic form.

                       CHAPTER XXVII. EXPROPRIATION OF THE
                   AGRICULTURAL POPULATION FROM THE LAND

        In England, serfdom had practically disappeared in the last part of the 14th century. The immense majority of the population consisted then, and to a still larger extent, in the 15th century, of free peasant proprietors, whatever was the feudal title under which their right of property was hidden. * * *

        The prelude of the revolution that laid the foundation of the capitalist mode of production, was played in the last third of the 15th, and the first decade of the 16th century. A mass of free proletarians was hurled on the labour-market by the breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers, who, as Sir James Steuart well says, ""everywhere uselessly filled house and castle."" Although the royal power, itself a product of bourgeois development, in its strife after absolute sovereignty forcibly hastened on the dissolution of these bands of retainers, it was by no means the sole cause of it. In insolent conflict with king and parliament, the great feudal lords created an incomparably larger proletariat by the forcible driving of the peasantry from the land, to which the latter had the same feudal right as the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the common lands. The rapid rise 6f the Flemish wool manufactures, and the corresponding rise in the price of wool in England, gave the direct impulse to these evictions. The old nobility had been devoured by the great feudal wars. The new nobility was the child of its time, for which money was the power of all powers. Transformation of arable land into sheep-walks was, therefore, its cry. * * *

        With the development of capitalist production during the manufacturing period, the public opinion o f Europe had lost the last remnant of shame and conscience. The nations bragged cynically of every infamy that served them as a means to capitalistic accumulation. Read, e.g., the naive Annals of Commerce of the worthy A . Anderson. Here it is trumpeted forth as a triumph of English statecraft that at the Peace of Utrecht, England extorted from the Spaniards by the Asiento Treaty the privilege of being allowed to ply the negro-trade, until then only carried on between Africa and the English West In dies, between Africa and Spanish America as well. England thereby acquired the right of supplying Spanish America until 1743 with 4,800 Negroes yearly. This threw, at the same time, an official cloak over British smuggling. Liverpool waxed fat on the slave-trade. This was its method of primitive accumulation. And, even to the present day, Liverpool ""respectability"" is the Pindar of the slave-trade which-compare the work of Aikin [1795] already quoted-""has coincided with that spirit of bold adventure which has characterised the trade of Liverpool and rapidly carried it to its present state of prosperity; has occasioned vast employment for shipping and sailors, and greatly augmented the demand for the manufactures of the country"" (p. 339). Liverpool employed in the slave-trade, in 1730, 15 ships; in 1751, 53; in 1760, 74; in 1770, 96; and in 1792, 132.

        Whilst the cotton industry introduced child-slavery in England, it gave in the United States a stimulus to the transformation of the earlier, more or less patriarchal slavery, into a system of commercial exploitation. In fact, the veiled slavery of the wage-workers in Europe needed, for its pedestal, slavery pure and simple in the new world.

        Tantre molis erat, to establish the ""eternal laws of Nature"" of the capitalist mode of production, to complete the process of separation between labourers and conditions of labour, to transform, at one pole, the social means of production and subsistence into capital, at the opposite pole, the mass of the population into wage labourers, into “free labouring poor” that artificial product of modern society. If money, according to Augier, ""comes into the world with a congenital blood-stain on one cheek,"" capital comes dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt.

           CHAPTER XXXI. GENESIS OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST

        The genesis of the industrial capitalist did not proceed in such a gradual way as that of the farmer. Doubtless many small guild-masters, and yet more independent small artisans, or even wage-labourers, transformed themselves into small capitalists, and (by gradually extending exploitation of wage-labour and corresponding accumulation) into full-blown capitalists. In the infancy of capitalist production, things often happened as in the infancy of mediaeval towns, where the question which of the escaped serfs should be master and which servant, was in great part decided by the earlier or later date of their flight. * * *

                                                       * * *

        The discovery of gold and silver in America, the extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signaIised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production . These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of .the European nations, with the globe for a theatre. It begins with the revolt of the Netherlands from Spain, assumes giant dimensions in England's AntiJacobin War, and is still going on in the opium wars against China, &c. The different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves now, more or less in chronological order, particularly over Spain, Portugal, Holland, France, and England. In England at the end of the 17th century, they arrive at a systematical combination, embracing the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation, and the protectionist system. These methods depend in part on brute force, e.g., the colonial system. But they all employ the power of the State, the concentrated and organised force of society, to hasten, hoth ouse fashion, the process of transformation of the feudal mode of production into the capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition. Force is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one. It is itself an economic power.

          CHAPTER XXXII. HISTORICAL TENDENCY OF CAPITALIST
                                         ACCUMULATION

        What does the primitive accumulation of capital, i.e., its historical genesis, resolve itself into? In so far as it is not immediate transformation of slaves and serfs into wage-labourers, and therefore a mere change of form, it only means the expropriation of the immediate producers, i.e., the dissolution of private property based on the labour of its owner. Private property, as the antithesis to social, collective property, exists only where the means of labour and the external conditions of labour belong to private individuals. But according as these private individuals are labourers or not labourers, private property has a different character. The numberless shades that it at first sight presents correspond to the intermediate stages lying between these two extremes. The private property of the labourer in his means of production is the foundation of petty industry, whether agricultural, manufacturing, or both; petty industry, again, is an essential condition for the development of social production and of the free individuality of the labourer himself. Of course, this petty mode of production exist also under slavery, serfdom, and other states of dependence, But it flourishes, it lets loose its whole energy, it attains its adequate classical form, only where the labourer is the private owner of his own means of labour set in action by himself: the peasant of the land which he cultivates, the artisan of the tool which he handles as a virtuoso. This mode of production pre-supposes parcelling of the soil, and scattering of the other means of production. As it excludes the concentration of these means of production, so also it excludes co-operation, division of labour within each separate process of production, the control over, and the productive application of the forces of Nature by society, and the free development of the social productive powers. It is compatible only with a system of production, and a society, moving within narrow and more or less primitive bounds. To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly says, ""to decree universal mediocrity."" At a certain stage of development it brings forth the material agencies for its own dissolution. From that moment new forces and new passions spring up in the bosom of society; but the old social organisation fetters them and keeps them down. It must be annihilated; it is annihilated. Its annihilation, the transformation of the individualised and scattered means of production into socially concentrated ones, of the pigmy property of the m any into the huge property of the few, the expropriation of the great mass of the people from the soil, from the means of subsistence, and from the means of labour, this fearful and painful expropriation of the mass of the people forms the prelude to the history of capital. It comprises a series of forcible methods, of which we have passed in review only those that have been epochmaking as methods of the primitive accumulation of capital. The expropriation of the immediate producers was accomplished with merciless Vandalism, and under the stimulus of passions the most infamous, the most sordid, the pettiest, the most meanly odious. Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent labouring-individual with the conditions of his labour, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labour of others, i.e., on wage-labour.

        As soon as this process of transformation has sufficiently decomposed the old society from top to bottom, as soon as the labourers are turned into proletarians, their means of labour into capital, as soon as the capitalist mode of production stands on its own feet, then the further socialisation of labour and further transformation of the land and other means of production into socially exploited and, therefore, common means of production, as well as the further expropriation of private proprietors, takes a new form. That which is now t o be expropriated is no longer the labourer working for himself, but the capitalist exploiting many labourers. This expropriation is accomplished by the action of the immanent laws of capitalistic production itself, by the centralisation of capital. One capitalist always kills many. Hand in hand with this centralisation, or this expropriation of many capitalists by a few, develop, on an ever-extending scale, the co-operative form of the labour-process, the conscious technical application of science, the methodical cultivation of the soil, the transformation of the instruments of labour into instruments of labour only usable in common, the economizing of all means of production by their use as the means of production of combined, socialised labour, the entanglement of all peoples in the net of the world-market, and with this, the international character of the capitalistic regime . Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of capital, who usurp and monopolise all advantages of this process of transformation, grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation, exploitation; but with this too grows the revolt of the working-class, a class always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organised by the very mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up and flourished along with, and under it. Centralisation of the means of production and socialisation of labour at last reach a point where they become incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.

        The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labour of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of Nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not re-establish private property for the producer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era: i.e., on co-operation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production.

        The transformation of scattered private property, arising from individual labour, into capitalist private property is, naturally, a process, incomparably more protracted, violent, and difficult, than the transformation of capitalistic private property, already practically resting on socialised production, into socialised property. In the former case, we had the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few usurpers; in the latter, we have the expropriation of a few surpers by the mass of the people.",Robert C. Tucker,1963,"[96, 91, 91]",3
624,Pretty Boy Lonely,"She is losing her religion. Yeah, it's not ‘cause of God. No, it's not ’cause of Satan. She is stuck in the middle. I know what you do when there's no one watching. I'm that pretty lonely boy in the arms of an avalanche. The sun dropped you out. But nobody even liked you, until your inheritance. Now you are in a parked car, going nowhere with all of your ugly friends. Riding high on prescription drugs, until you are slowly letting go. I've got it all on my shoulders, I've got it all on my shoulders, I sold my soul but I got it back on me. But I brought you in, laid you on the silver couch. I brought you in, your eyes were rolling back. I've got it all on my shoulders, I've got it all on my shoulders, I sold my soul but I got it back on me. Because you rely on me. I ride my bike down to Duncan's to get my dad some cigarettes, he says he needs them like his coffee and his hopelessness. But I don't believe him anymore. Yeah, I don't believe him anymore. Says he is disappointed in me at the dinner table. Who can stay in school, but fail his grade? I don't have the heart to tell him that I've hardly been there. He calls my sister a dyke, drags her across the floor because she doesn't like boys anymore. And I can hear her packing her bags in her room and I want to go with her but I'm only fourteen years old.

632,The Cinnamon Cinder (It's A Very Nice Dance),"IN THE LONG PROCESS OF EDITINGA Christmas book entitled ""ELF"" sits on a table, a drawing of 6'2"" BUDDY THE ELF (the guy we've seen from all the trailers and posters) is on the cover.
We push in on the book and it magically flips open to the first page: a drawing of small Papa Elf in his wonderful work shop.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
PULL OUT FROM THE BOOK TO REVEAL
The real life Elf and Workshop of the drawing we have just seen. PAPA ELF, 540 years old or roughly 55 in human years, is surrounded by scores of strange and specific tools and some scattered half-built toys.
PAPA ELF
So you're here for the story? Okay. Just let me wet my whistle.
He pours himself a shot of milk in a snow-flake shot glass and downs it.
PAPA ELF
(like it's liquor)
Whoo! That's strong! Must be two percent! Elves love to tell stories, you probably didn't know that, did you? Well, there's a lot of things about us that people don't know. For instance, we can't tell a lie. It's physiologically impossible. Here's another interesting Elf-ism: There are three jobs available to an Elf. You can make shoes at night while an old cobbler sleeps...but it's not exactly the most rewarding work.
QUICK CUT AWAY TO
Two ELVES hammering away at a pile of shoes as a fat shoemaker sleeps with a copy of ""Hot Cobbler"" magazine on his chest, a busty cobbler lady on the cover.
DISGRUNTLED COBBLER ELF
Lazy bastard couldn't even make a flip-flop...
EXT. ELF TREE - DAY
The exterior of a tree, we hear cooking going on inside.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
...you can bake cookies in a tree. But it's dangerous having an oven in an oak during dry season...
We hear a yelp and now a siren rings and then the TREE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, ELVES SCURRYING OUT.
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
PAPA ELF
But the third job. Well, the third job makes being an Elf worthwhile. Some call it ""the show"" or the ""big dance"". It's the profession every Elf aspires to. And that's to build toys in Santa's workshop.
CUT TO:
A TRACKING SHOT OF SANTA'S WORKSHOP
The CAMERA whips by a crowd of bustling elves building dolls, toy horses, action figures, squirt guns...everything. There's even a row of X-boxes being assembled.
PAPA ELF
It's a job only an Elf can do. Our nimble fingers, natural cheer and active minds are perfect for toy building. They've tried using Gnomes or Trolls but the Gnomes drank too much and the Trolls weren't toilet trained.
CUT AWAY:
1) A drunk GNOME, stein in hand, vomiting below the table. 2) A TROLL wearing a diaper is chewed out by an Elf cleaning up the floor.
PAPA ELF
And no human could ever do this work. Their hands are too big and they tend to get testy when over worked. In fact, no human has ever set foot in Santa's workshop. That is until about thirty years ago. And in case you haven't guessed it, that's our story. It was back in 1968. A particularly successful Christmas...
INT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT
A Christmas tree flickers. A nurse changes a giggling ten month-old BABY's diaper.
NURSE
You're quite a giggler, aren't you?
(lying him down)
Well, it's time for night-night.
She tucks the baby in and exits.
NURSE
(as she leaves)
Merry Christmas, my angel.
CLOSE ON
The Rocking Crib. The BABY rises, giggling. His eyes light up as he stands, holding the gate of the crib.
Santa's black boots drop in from the chimney. The baby shakes the gate. Quickly, Santa moves to the Christmas tree, where he lays out presents. There is an OFF-SCREEN CLANG! Santa LOOKS UP and sees the empty crib. The gate is down:
BABY'S POV
He gleefully skitters across the floor towards a large, fuzzy teddy bear in SANTA'S BIG RED BAG.
FADE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP
A bevy of ELVES with slightly larger 60's Elf collars and sideburns celebrate another successful Christmas. Several elves start CHANTING for a speech. SANTA, seated in his rocker, stands to applause. Merrily, he gestures for quiet.
SANTA
Alright, alright...Well, we've had another successful year. Prancer was able to control his bladder over Baltimore, and we didn't forget Delaware...
A party HORN blows. LAUGHTER. Santa cheerfully pats down with his hands for quiet.
SANTA
And now after a lot of hard work it's time for a vacation, starting now!
Santa looks at his watch as five seconds click off. The elves all rest their heads on their elbows.
SANTA
Alright! Vacation's over! Back to work! Time to start preparations for next Christmas.
The elves cheer and get back to work. When an OFF-SCREEN COOING is heard.
SANTA
What in the name of Sam Hill...?
More COOING. Perplexed, Santa looks down to his bag just as a human baby, dressed only in a diaper, crawls out and smiles.
Silence. The elves stare in awe at the strange visitor. An ELF looks on the back of his diaper and sees the brand name ""Little Buddy Diapers"".
ELF TWIN #2
It's name is Buddy. He must've...
ELF TWIN #1
...snuck into your sack at the orphanage. What do we do, Santa?
Santa looks befuddled.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Santa had a decision to make. But fortunately when it comes to babies, Santa's a push over. So Buddy would stay with an older Elf who had always wanted a child, but had been so committed to building toys, he had forgotten to settle down. Yes, Buddy was raised by me, his adopted father. My, how I love that boy.
MONTAGE: BUDDY GROWING UP AS AN ELF
A giant baby is wedged into an extra-tiny crib.

Tough Buddy grew twice as fast, he wasn't any different from the other little elves. I mean, not really...
Video Footage: of 7-year old Buddy riding a really small tricycle around in circles at a birthday party with a laughing Elf child on his back and another Elf under his arm.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And though it is against the Code of Elves to lie, all agreed that until Buddy asked us, no one was going to bring up the fact that he was actually a human being.

QUICK CUTS
A smiling Buddy pounds tiny elves into the boards with brute force. The elves are helpless. Buddy finishes this off with a wicked slap-shot.
ANNOUNCER
(like an elf Pat Foley)
He SCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORES! And it's 14-zero with eleven minutes left in the first period.
INT. ELF LOCKER ROOM - DAY
Post game, Buddy's in the locker room. Elves congratulate him and occasionally reach up to slap him on the butt.
POM POM
Good game, Buddy.
BUDDY
Thanks! Sorry about your shoulder, Pom Pom!
POM POM
No sweat. It's just a collar bone!
They're all tossing their jock straps in the bin. Little Elf jocks land, and then a HUGE ONE, proportionately the size of a large serving tray. It's Buddy's.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
But as much as Buddy was accepted by his friends and family, there were drawbacks to being a human in an elves' world.
RAPID FIRE:
A dozen shots of Buddy slamming his face into doorways, beams, cabinets. These shots look shockingly painful.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles dickens! Sone of a nutcracker!
INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
The FINALE: Buddy attempts to put a star on top of the semi-tall Elf Christmas tree.
But Buddy's pointy Elf slipper gets hung up in an ornament.
The elves step back, preparing for the inevitable: Buddy panics, wiggles his leg and pulls the tree over on top of him, falling into the fire place and engulfing in flames.
Pom Pom sprays him with a mini-fire extinguisher.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And no where were Buddy's differences more obvious than in Santa's toy shop.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NORTH POLE - DAY
We see an assembly line of elves making Etch-a-sketches with wooden hammers. We pan finally to Buddy as an ELF SUPERVISOR APPROACHES.
BUDDY
Gee, I'm sorry, Ming-Ming. I'm gonna come in a little short on my quota today.
ELF SUPERVISOR
It's okay, Buddy. How many Etcha-Sketches did you get finished?
Buddy is about to answer. But then his face winces up. FIGHTING BACK TEARS.
ELF SUPERVISOR
How many, Buddy? It's okay, you can tell me.
Clearly tearing up now, Buddy sets his tiny wooden hammer to the side and reveals a box of his toys.
BUDDY
I only made...
(crying)
Eighty-five.
Eighty-five? He might as well have said zero. The elves all look at each other.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, don't worry about it Buddy. This is a great start! You're only 915 off pace.
BUDDY
Oh, why don't you just say it Ming Ming?! I'm the worst toy maker in the whole world! I'm a cotton-head ninny-muggins!
ELF SUPERVISOR
Oh, you're not a cotton-head ninny muggins! We all have different talents, that's all.
BUDDY
Actually, it seems like everyone has the same talents. Except for me.
ELF SUPERVISOR
That's not true, you have lots of talents. Special talents. Like, uh...
Supervisor Elf looks around to the other Elves for back up. They try to chime in.
ELF #1
You changed the batteries in the fire alarm!
ELF #2
(absurdly positive)
You sure did! Triple A's! And in six months, you'll need to check 'em again! Won't he!
(everyone agrees)
ELF #3
And you're the only baritone in the Elf choir. Without you, we'd sound like a bunch of...I mean, you bring us down a whole octave!
ELF #1
In a good way!
ELF SUPERVISOR
See? You're not a cotton-head ninny muggins. You're Ex-traordinary!
BUDDY
Well, you know what? I'm sick of being extraordinary!
Upset, Buddy struggles to get his thighs out from under his desk, and now runs off, tagging his head on the door frame.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Buddy storms into his tiny house. Papa Elf looks up from his work, surprised. Buddy can't speak. He runs over and locks himself in the bathroom.
INT. ELF BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
This bathroom is ABSURDLY SMALL, Buddy squeezes in like Harry Houdini. The toilet is the size of a Big Gulp cup. Buddy sits on it and starts to sob. Washing his face in the tiny sink.
KNOCK KNOCK.
We INTERCUT with Papa Elf at the door.
PAPA ELF
Son? Are you okay?
BUDDY
Go away!
PAPA ELF
(shocked)
Buddy!
BUDDY
I'm sorry, papa. May I please have some Buddy time?
PAPA ELF
Open up, son. I think we need to talk.
The door finally creeks open, revealing a funny wide shot of him squeezed into this box of a room. He wiggles out. Still wiggling.
PAPA ELF
Come sit with your papa.
Papa sits on the couch, Buddy sits on Papa Elf's knee. Papa winces.
PAPA ELF
Alright, let's hear it.
BUDDY
Well, everyone knows you're Santa's Master Tinker. And Grandpapa was Master Tinker before you. And great Grandpapa before ye. I'm supposed to follow in your footsteps...but I'm always letting everyone down.
PAPA ELF
Well, there's something I should probably tell you, Buddy. And it's long over due...
(intense beat)
You see...um...
BUDDY
What is it, Papa?
Papa Elf looks into Buddy's beautifully innocent eyes. He can't bring himself to do it.
PAPA ELF
(changing the subject)
I need your help on something.
(adjusting Buddy's weight)
Up up now, nice and -- ow, OW!... There we are.
Papa Elf leads Buddy through a door to reveal the most amazing sight Buddy has ever beheld.
SANTA'S SLEIGH
A GLOW emanates from the hand-rubbed, red-lacquered wood chassis, illuminating the entire room.
BUDDY
Wow. Santa's sleigh!
(hesitates)
Can I touch it?
PAPA ELF
Touch it? You're going to help me make it fly, Buddy.
BUDDY
I thought the magical reindeer made the sleigh fly.
PAPA ELF
And where do the reindeers get their magic from?
BUDDY
Christmas spirit. Everyone knows that.
PAPA ELF
Yes, but unfortunately, Christmas Spirit is becoming a very limited resource.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
PAPA ELF
(hard to break the news)
Well, Buddy, as silly as it sounds, there are a lot of people down South who don't believe in Santa Claus.
BUDDY
(shocked)
What? Who do they think puts all their toys under the tree?
PAPA ELF
There's a rumor floating around that parents are putting them there.
BUDDY
That's ridiculous! There's no way parents could do that all in one night! And what about Santa's cookies!? I suppose parents eat them too?
PAPA ELF
I know...but every year less and less people are believing in Santa, and today we've got a real energy crisis on our hands. See how low the Claus-o-meter is?
We see a gauge on the instrument panel of the sleigh with CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LEVELS written and a needle resting in the DANGEROUSLY LOW red section.
PAPA ELF
That's why I installed this little baby back in the sixties.
Papa pushes a RED BUTTON, causing a JET ENGINE to shudder with a high-pitched whir. Buddy is amazed.
BUDDY
Oh my Gosh!
PAPA ELF
Watch the language son.
BUDDY
Forgive me, Papa. What's that?
PAPA ELF
A Viper turbojet with 358 cubic meters of displacement, high volume air intake and customized spark timing.
(off Buddy's look)
I know, it's a little less magical, but everyone's still getting their wish, that's the important thing, right?
(around him)
Listen, the motor mounts are giving me some wiggle. Do you want to give the ol' man a hand?
BUDDY
(coming around)
Do I?!
And just like that, father and son hunker down and tinker together.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - TOY TESTING - THE NEXT DAY
We push past a tiny door marked TESTING. Elves everywhere are testing toys. Buddy stands in front of a conveyor belt pushing Jack in the Boxes past him. He turns the crank producing the 'POP GOES THE WEASEL' tune and a puppet pops out scaring him every time. POP!
BUDDY
Ahh!
Another one: POP!
BUDDY
UHHHH!
This one doesn't pop for a beat and then: POP!
BUDDY
(biggest one yet)
AHHHH!!
(to supervisor)
I'm going to take five, okay Krumpet?
KRUMPET
Okay!
We follow Buddy as he approaches an Elf kitchenette. But before he enters, he stops, over-hearing a few Elves drinking cider and talking behind his back.
FOOM FOOM
...and that EX-traordinary bit! That was quick thinking.
ELF SUPERVISOR
Hey, I feel bad for the guy. I just hope he doesn't get wise.
FOOM FOOM
Hey, he's believed he was a real Elf for this long, hasn't he?
WE SLAM INTO A CLOSE UP OF BUDDY'S SHOCKED FACE
QUICK SERIES OF FLASHBACKS FROM BUDDY'S PAST flash before his eyes not unlike 'the sixth sense'.
AT THE SHOEMAKER: Buddy is painfully squeezing into new shoes.
IN BED: Buddy tosses and turns - three beds have been pushed together to make a human twin-sized bed.
IN THE ELF SHOWERS: Buddy is struggling to wash under a three-foot high shower head.
THE ELF CHOIR PHOTO: Only Buddy's waist is visible, he's cropped out.
An exact replay of those rapid-fire shots of Buddy slamming his head into doorways, beams, cabinets.
BUDDY
Ow...jeez...yikes...golly...charles...Dickens! Sone of a Nutcracker!
IN THE FACTORY: tinkering with a Ken Doll, Buddy moves the arms like his arms.
BACK ON BUDDY, queasy. His head spins as the CAMERA CIRCLES HIM. The room spins. Buddy's knees go weak.
Pom Pom hurries over, concerned.
POM POM
You don't look so good, Buddy. Are you okay?
Buddy tries to speak, but instead COLLAPSES RIGHT ON TOP OF POM POM, crushing him beneath his weight.
POM POM
(muffled under Buddy)
I'm okay, Buddy. Don't worry about a thing. I'm warm.
INT. PAPA'S WORKSHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER
Buddy wakes up from his sleep to find himself in Papa's workshop. FOCUS RACKS to Papa tending to his son.
BUDDY
Ooooooh. I had a terrible nightmare.
PAPA ELF
What is it, Buddy?
BUDDY
I dreamt I wasn't an Elf at all. I was a human. Oh, it was awful. I'm not a human, am I Papa?
PAPA ELF
I knew this day would come. You see, Buddy, I love you and nothing can ever change that. But the fact is, it wasn't a dream. You're not like the rest of us.
BUDDY
You mean I'm not an Elf?
PAPA ELF
No, son, you're a human being.
BUDDY
No wonder I'm always freezing!
PAPA ELF
We decided it was best to let you think you were one of us.
BUDDY
But I thought elves can't lie.
PAPA ELF
We can't. But Buddy, you never asked! I thought for sure when you cracked six feet it would come up.
BUDDY
(getting upset)
I thought I had a glandular problem.
PAPA ELF
Your glands are fine.
BUDDY
(emotional)
So, you're not my Papa?
PAPA ELF
Oh, I'll always be your Papa. It's just you have another Papa, too. A biological Papa.
Papa Elf opens a drawer and shows Buddy a photo: a young couple are in love...
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
I then proceeded to tell Buddy of how his father had fallen in love when he was very young with a beautiful girl named Susan Welles, and how Buddy was born and put up for adoption by his mother. And how she had later passed away. I told him his father had never even known Buddy was born. And most importantly, I told him where his Dad was: in a magical land called New York City.
Papa Elf puts a snow globe in front of Buddy showing the Empire State Building with a sign NEW YORK CITY.
BUDDY
Uhh! I feel confused and sweaty! I need some Buddy time!
Buddy runs off.
PAPA ELF
Buddy?! Buddy?!!
EXT. NORTH POLE - MINUTES LATER
Buddy runs and runs. He passes some ANIMATED ANIMALS, a RABBIT, a RACCOON and a SQUIRREL.
RACCOON
Hey, Buddy! Want to sing and pick snow berries?
BUDDY
Not now Pipsy!!
He passes by an ANIMATED SNOWMAN in the front yard of a toasty little cottage.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(a faint whisper)
Oooohhh! Buddy...
BUDDY
Hi, Jim. What's wrong?
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(very quietly)
Uh, ow. Sorry...my back's out of line again. Do you mind cracking it for me again?
BUDDY
Sure, Jim.
Buddy comes from behind him, squeezes and then we hear a CRACK.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
(speaking at full volume)
Ohhh, thank you, Buddy. That's soooo good. It's from all the standing. They never build me sitting down. Hey? Why the long face?
BUDDY
Well, Jim. It seems I'm...I'm not an Elf.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Of course you're not. You're six-three and had a beard when you were fifteen.
BUDDY
Papa says my real father is living in a magical place far away.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
At least you have a father. I was just rolled up one day. I never had anyone to play catch with. And even if I did. I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I guess I am pretty lucky after all.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
I bet your dad would be so happy to see you, he'd hug you and never let go. I wish I had a dad to hug. And even if I did, I only have sticks for arms.
BUDDY
I understand about your arms, Jim.
JIM THE SNOWMAN
Well, you should do all the things I can't. Go see him. Hug him. And play catch. And scratch your ass.
BUDDY
I will. I'm gonna go find my dad!
INT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP - THE NEXT DAY
A triumphant swell of music as Buddy walks through the workshop for the last time. Each Elf he passes says goodbye.
BUDDY
Bye Choo-choo! Bye Sunshine! Bye Tinkle Winkle! By Puffy! Bye Flade! Bye Gayle!
Santa steps into frame and puts his arm around Buddy.
SANTA
So I hear you're going on a little journey to the big city?
BUDDY
Yeah, but I'm kind of nervous. Jim told me New York is really different.
SANTA
Don't listen to Jim. He's never been anywhere. He doesn't even have any feet. I've been to New York thousands of times.
BUDDY
Wow. What's it like?
SANTA
Well there's some things you should know: first off, if you see gum on the street, leave it there. It's not free candy. Second, there are like thirty Ray's Pizzas and they all say they're the original, but the real one's on eleventh. And if you see a sign for a Peep show, it doesn't mean they're letting you look at presents before Christmas.
BUDDY
So much to remember...
SANTA
Don't worry, something tells me this trip is going to be good for you.
(patting him on the back)
It's time for my Buddy here to spread his wings.
BUDDY
I can't wait! Me and Dad are gonna go ice-skating and eat sugarplums!
SANTA
That's the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. You see, Buddy, your father... Well he's on the naughty list.
FAST PUSH INTO:
The NAUGHTY LIST, landing on ""Walter Hobbs.""
BUDDY
NOOOOOO!!!!
SANTA
I'm sorry, but it's true.
BUDDY
My stomach hurts. It feels like evil.
SANTA
Listen, Buddy, some people. They get mixed up about what's important in life. But that doesn't mean they can't change. Maybe your dad just needs a little Christmas spirit!
BUDDY
I'm good at that!
SANTA
I know you are.
Papa Elf steps forward, trying to hide the fact that he's tearing up. He and Buddy embrace.
PAPA ELF
I love you, Buddy. And I'll always be here for you.
(crying)
Now go on, get!
BUDDY
(crying)
Yes, Papa.
(crying and skipping)
Bye guys. I'll miss you. I really will.
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Animals wave as Buddy heads off into the unknown.
ANIMALS
Bye, Buddy.
BUDDY
Bye lovable woodland animals!
EXT. NORTH POLE - NIGHT
Buddy sits on an ice flow. He drifts along the cold sea through a haze, transitioning from the MAGIC LAND of the north pole to the REAL WORLD.
EXT. SNOW FIELD - DAY
Buddy trudges through a massive snow field. Each step he takes goes down five feet deep, we DISSOLVE to a series of scenes showing this epic struggle. He wears a beard of ice.
Exhausted, Buddy considers leaving himself for dead, but uses his last ounce of strength to pull out the old PHOTO of his father, WALTER HOBBS.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - MEANWHILE
A large children's storybook publishing company. LARGE-SIZED book covers line the wall. ""Max the Big Blue Cat"", ""The Adventures of Rabbit Gang & Pop"", etc. This place runs like a well-oiled machine.
A huge corner office says 'WALTER HOBBS, EDITOR.'
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - DAY
Walter is the guy from Buddy's picture, only he looks a little older and a little meaner.
A NUN stands in front of Walter's large desk.
NUN
You're taking the books back?
WALTER
Hey, you're the one who's behind on the payments, don't try to make me out to be the bad guy here.
NUN
We're trying to get yo the money, but it's been difficult to raise the funding...the children are sponsoring another bake sale next month. That should help.
WALTER
See, there's your problem. You can't expect a bake sale to make solid cash these days. Places like Dunkin' Donuts and Cinnibon are expanding their product base with alternative breakfast and desert items. Even Starbucks carries baked goods. You guys really need to start thinking out of the box.
(out window; to NYC)
It's called capitalism, Miss Peters. If you can't stand the heat, move to Canada.
NUN
(begging)
The kids really love the books.
WALTER
You don't need to tell me that, I made them. I'm the one who ran the focus groups.
DEB, the secretary, pokes her head in.
DEB
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
Would you please use the intercom? We talked about this.
DEB
Do you want me to use it now? I mean, I already told you.
Walter purposefully ignores her. Deb leaves frame and now we hear her on the intercom.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, your two o'clock is here.
WALTER
(hitting button)
Got it.
(to Nun, compassionate)
Tell you what, I know how much these books mean to your kids over there...
(beat)
I'll give you a three-week extension.
NUN
(sarcastic)
Bless your heart.
WALTER
(too busy to hear)
If I were you, I'd stay away from perishable goods. Think consumer services. That's hot right now.
EXT. CANADA - DAY
Buddy is half-way there. He's now clearly in the real world. He walks through a choppy, muddy, snowy terrain past a rusted propane tank. A REAL LIVE RACCOON crosses his path. Buddy acts like it's a cartoon.
BUDDY
Heyyyy. What's your name? I'm Buddy!
Buddy corners the raccoon, trapping it. Trying to be nice. IT hisses like crazy. But Buddy is undeterred.
BUDDY
Sounds like someone needs a hug!
He lunges forward. Like lightning, the raccoon BITES Buddy in the face.
BUDDY
NUT CRACKERS!!!
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Buddy walks along the Highway, looks up, then stops in his tracks.
REVEAL: A sign that says NEW YORK CITY/LINCOLN TUNNEL. His eyes light up.
EXT. MANHATTAN - MORNING
We see Buddy timidly inch his way through the Lincoln Tunnel along the walkway, pressed up against the wall while traffic roars by. Like a stray cat, Buddy dodges through traffic. His feelings of wonder are starting to be replaced with fear. He exits to the sight of the towering skyline of New York City with the sun breaking over it. He sees the Empire State Building, then looks at his snow globe.
BUDDY
Whoa...
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is caught up in the rhythms of the street and begins noticing the mundane details of this new world with amazement: traffic lights. Steam. Scaffolding.
WIDE SHOT
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy attempts to greet a sea of people, but New Yorkers ignore the guy in the Elf suit.
BUDDY
Hi.
(no response; next person)
Happy afternoon!
(no response; next person)
Salutations!
-- A woman tries to hail A cab. Buddy waves back.
-- Buddy looks up at awe at the animated billboard on the Lehman Building. A guy bumps into him.
WALKER
Why don't you watch your ass, buddy!
Buddy nods, then sticks his butt out and looks at it.
-- Buddy runs round and round A revolving door and loving every moment.
-- A sign at a crappy diner ""World's Best Cup of Coffee!"" Buddy is excited and enters. The jaded BANGLADESHI STAFF stares at him blankly.
BUDDY
Wow! The world's best cup of coffee! You did it! Congratulations! To all of you!
-- Gum on the ground. Yum!Buddy picks it up, plays with it, then pops it in his mouth and chews with A smile. Now his face suddenly changes.
-- Two guys are handing out different flyers. Buddy is given one. HE looks at it, then, in Marx Brothers-like fashion, hands it to flyer guy #2. Flyer guy #2 takes it, then gives Buddy one of his own flyers. This delights Buddy, who now repeats the ri
-- A dog walker picks up some dog crap with newspaper. Buddy sees some other crap on the sidewalk, grabs some newspaper and picks it up. Buddy walks right behind the man and offers it to him to be helpful.
REVEAL: Empire State Building!
Buddy holds up his Empire State Building SNOW GLOBE and compares the skyscraper to his toy one.
BUDDY
Dad...
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
ECU: The PUPPY AND THE PIGEON book is in Walter's hands. A PRINTER faces him.
WALTER
A re-print? Do you know how much that's gonna cost?
PRINTER
Two whole pages are missing. The story makes no sense.
WALTER
You think a kid is going to notice two pages? All they do is look at the pictures.
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS
Buddy gets in the elevator with a bunch of Republican-looking PEOPLE. He's whistling really loud and happy, confusing them.
Another passenger gets on.
ACCOUNTANT
Can you press 67 please?
Unsure of what may happen, he pushes 67. The number LIGHTS UP.
BUDDY
Hey, that's pretty.
Like lightning, he presses ALL 75 BUTTONS.
BUDDY
Look at that!
QUICK CUTS
The elevator doors open and close, floor by floor. No one is smiling, except for
Buddy.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
WALTER
How the hell did this happen, anyway?
PRINTER
Well, you signed off on all the final plates and...
WALTER
You know what? I don't need to know. Let's just get this solved.
INT. DEB'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
Deb stares dead pan at the Elf in front of her desk.
BUDDY
Buddy the Elf, here for a Mr. Walter Hobbs, please.
DEB
You look hilarious. Who sent you?
BUDDY
Papa Elf, from the North Pole.
DEB
Papa Elf? That's rich.
INT. WALTER HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the printer continue.
PRINTER
You really think we should ship them?
WALTER
(sarcastic)
No, I want to take a thirty-thousand dollar bath, so some kid understands what happened to a friggin' Puppy and a Pigeon.
(beat)
Ship them!
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom)
Mr. Hobbs, it's me on the intercom.
WALTER
Go ahead.
DEB (O.S.)
I think someone sent you a Christmas-gram.
WALTER
A Christmas-gram? I don't have time for a Christmas-gram.
Over Walter's shoulder, we see Buddy step into frame behind him. Sensing this, Walter slowly turns around.
BUDDY
Dad?
Looking nervous and excited, he adjusts his hat and vest.
WALTER
Oh, um, alright. Let's get this over with.
We see a small crowd of people have gathered by the door to watch the supposed singing telegram.
BUDDY
I walked all day and night to find you.
WALTER
(playing along)
Looks like you came from the North Pole.
BUDDY
That's exactly where I came from. Santa must've called you.
WALTER
Yeah, I just got off my cell with him. So? Go on.
BUDDY
Go on with what?
WALTER
Are you gonna sing a song or can I get back to work?
BUDDY
A song? Anything for you, Dad. Let's see...
(trying to make up a song)
I'M HERE WITH MY DAD. I'VE NEVER MET HIM AND HE WANTS ME TO SING A SONG. I WAS ADOPTED AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS BORN. BUT I'M HERE AND I LOVE YOU, DAD!!!
He hugs him.
WALTER
Wow. That's weird. Usually you guys just put my name into a Jingle Bells or something.
BUDDY
It's me, your son! Susan Welles had me and didn't tell you, but now here I am! It's me, Buddy!
WALTER
Susan Welles?! Did you just say Susan Welles? What kind of Christmas gram is this?
BUDDY
What's a Christmas gram?
WALTER
(whispering)
Deb, we may want to call security.
DEB
(whispering)
I already did.
Buddy leans in.
BUDDY
(whispering)
I like to whisper, too.
EXT. STREET - FIVE MINUTES LATER
TWO SECURITY GUARDS have each of Buddy's arms and are frog-walking him out the front doors and onto the sidewalk.
BUDDY
My dad runs this whole company! I bet he's a genius.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Must run in the family.
(they laugh)
I wouldn't come back for a while if I were you.
BUDDY
Yeah, it seemed like he may need some 'Daddy time.'
(as he's escorted)
You guys are strong!
SECURITY GUARD #1
Yeah, get lost.
BUDDY
I already am lost!
They throw Buddy's JINGLED hat at him and walk back inside.
BUDDY
Bye, Glenn. Bye Chris!
Buddy picks up his hat, dusts it off, then looks across the street and sees New York's version of ELF MECCA
REVEAL
EXT. GIMBELS DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
It's huge. Full of lights and music, Christmas at its grandest.
BUDDY
(face aglow)
Wow!
Buddy starts skipping across the street toward Gimbels when --
BAM! Buddy's hit by a CAB! He flies off-screen. This is totally shocking. Traffic stops. And now Buddy comes skipping back into frame.
BUDDY
I'm okay! Thank you!
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
The halls are decked. This is epic. Buddy walks through happy in his Elf suit. A PERFUME CLERK approaches.
PERFUME CLERK
Passion fruit spray?
BUDDY
Fruit Spray? For real?
Buddy opens his mouth and closes his eyes. The clerk just stares at him.
BUDDY
(mouth open)
Ready when you are!
The clerk looks around, then, mildly curious, sprays it i n like Binacca. PSST!
Yuch! Buddy stumbles around blind, scraping his tongue off. About to throw up.
MONTAGE: Buddy Does Gimbels
ESCALATOR
Buddy stops at the edge of an escalator, afraid to get on, like a kid at the edge of a diving board. He's clogging tons of holiday traffic.
ANGRY MAN
(annoyed)
Are you going or what?
BUDDY
Um, yeah...
Buddy steps forward with one leg. And the escalator yanks him into the splits.
BUDDY
Jiminy Christmas!
PUBLIC BATHROOM
Buddy leaves the stall, then accosts a stranger.
BUDDY
Have you seen this toilet!? It's GI-NORMOUS!!!
(to another guy)
Look at this toilet!
STORE
Buddy grabs 3,000 candy canes and starts eating them with great intensity.
ELEVATOR
Buddy faces the wrong way in the elevator, face to face with a man.
ANGRY MAN
(about to punch him)
You think you're pretty smart, huh?
BUDDY
I'm not that smart, but thanks.
LINGERIE SECTION
Buddy sees a display of sexy nighties with a sign over it: For that special someone!
BUDDY
For that special someone? Hmmm...
A HARD-ASS ELF MANAGER walks over.
ELF MANAGER
Man, what in the hell are you doing fartin' around on the first floor?
BUDDY
Looking at shiny things.
ELF MANAGER
Shiny things?? Get your butt back up to the ninth floor before I put my foot up your green ass.
BUDDY
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - 9TH FLOOR SANTA LAND - LATER
We PAN a LAME SANTA LAND. It's not very impressive. Buddy is doing a thorough inspection.
BUDDY
This snow looks fake.
ELF MANAGER
It's white, ain't it?
BUDDY
Snow doesn't just pile up unless it's moved through the use of a tool, such as a shovel. I would give this some natural erosion, a slight wind drift look.
ELF MANAGER
What the hell are you talkin' about? EROSION?! Don't touch the damn snow. What are you smiling at? You think I'm a joke?
BUDDY
Oh, no, I'm just smiling. Smiling is my favorite.
ELF MANAGER
Well take it down a notch.
Buddy tries to frown for a second, but his lips quiver and hurt and now he's smiling again, making the exact same face.
ELF MANAGER
Alright, smiley, sweep the tin foil off this path. Santa's going to be here tomorrow.
BUDDY
SANTA?!
(eyes wide)
OH...MY...GOD!!!!
(suddenly skeptical)
Wait. Santa Claus?
ELF MANAGER
Yeah. Where've you been?
BUDDY
The North Pole.
ELF MANAGER
Ha. Ha. Start elfing.
(as he leaves)
And don't touch the snow.
He walks off, looking back, annoyed. Now something grabs Buddy's full attention.
BUDDY'S POV
SLO-MO - JOVIE DAVIS. 20s, a petite beauty, dressed as an Elf. She glides like a vision to the Christmas tree where she hangs balls from a ladder. Buddy stares up at her.
JOVIE
Are you enjoying the view?
BUDDY
Yes I am! I was standing over there and I thought you looked pretty so I came over to tell you that you look pretty.
JOVIE
Why're you messin' with me? Did Krumpet put you up to this?
BUDDY
I'm not messing with you. It's nice to meet a human who shares my affinity for the Elf culture.
JOVIE
I wouldn't call it an affinity. I'm just trying to get through the holidays.
BUDDY
Get through? Christmas is the greatest day in the whole wide world!
JOVIE
Well someone's been drinking the Kool Aid.
(Buddy doesn't get it)
Believe me, after a few years of this, you'll learn to tune it all out.
BUDDY
Uh-oh. It sounds like someone needs to sing a Christmas Carol!
JOVIE
(confused)
Are you serious?
BUDDY
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
JOVIE
Well, thanks, but I don't sing.
BUDDY
Oh, it's easy! It's just like talking, only louder and longer and you move it up and down.
JOVIE
Well, I can sing. I just don't sing. Especially in front of other people. I could never do that.
BUDDY
Never? If you can sing by yourself, you can sing anytime, there's no difference.
JOVIE
Actually, there's a big difference.
BUDDY
No there isn't. Watch.
(suddenly singing loudly)
I'M IN A STORE AND I'M SINGING! PEOPLE ARE HERE AND I'M IN A STORE!!
Everyone looks at him like he's...well, Elf. Jovie seems a little uncomfortable.
BUDDY
THE STORE IS ALL SHINY AND I'M IN A STORE!!
(then back to normal)
See?
JOVIE
(bewildered)
Wow.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(over loudspeaker)
Attention, Gimbels will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your final purchases.
All the elves look relieved. Their day is over.
J
OVIE
Dismissed.
BUDDY
You're leaving? But Santa's coming.
JOVIE
(she laughs at his 'joke')
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, um, what's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
JOVIE
Jovie. See ya.
With that, Jovie walks off. Buddy looks around as the half-baked Santa Land empties out.
QUICK SERIES OF CUTS
The doors being locked, employees exiting, lights flickering off.
A SECURITY GUARD WALKS DOWN AN AISLE
Behind him, Buddy does a commando roll through the aisle. Then pops up next to some toys.
Buddy starts pulling all sorts of things off the shelves: paint, robots, a fire truck...he looks at a logo.
BUDDY
They have Elves in Taiwan?
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
EMILY has prepared a beautiful dinner. She is an attractive, upper East-side woman.
Walter fills a plate. Their son, MICHAEL, 10, eats without enthusiasm, detached.
WALTER
I'm gonna go eat in my den, okay? I've got a bunch of stuff to go over.
EMILY
Are you sure?
WALTER
Yeah, I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
He goes to kiss her on the forehead, she doesn't offer it. So he kisses the top of her hair...and now leaves.
MICHAEL
Can I eat in my room?
EMILY
No.
MICHAEL
Why not? Dad's eating in his den.
(smart ass)
I have a bunch of homework to go over...I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
EMILY
You're eating here.
MICHAEL
Fine. But I'm not going to talk.
EMILY
Yes you are. You're going to tell me how your day was.
(beat)
How was your day?
Michael stares tight-lipped. This infuriates Emily.
EMILY
(suddenly)
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?!
MICHAEL
It was fine! Okay? Good.
INT. WALTER'S DEN - LATER
Walter is looking at an OLD YEAR BOOK. He studies a picture of a young, beautiful 'Susan Welles.'
EMILY
What're you looking at?
Walter hides the book.
WALTER
Nothing. It's for work.
EMILY
You know, it'd be nice if we ate together as a family once in a while.
WALTER
I'm sorry. I've gotta work. How do you think I feel? You think I like to work?
EMILY
Actually, I do.
(beat)
I'm really worried about Michael. He's getting detached and cynical. They're not supposed to do that until they're teenagers.
WALTER
Well he is thirteen years old.
EMILY
He's ten.
(exasperated)
I don't know what's going on with you, but I've just about had it.
WALTER
Had it with what?
That was the wrong answer.
WALTER
Emily. Wait. I'm sorry. I've been under a lot of stress at work.
EMILY
If you say the word WORK one more time, you're sleeping at the Marriot.
WALTER
(a tiny ounce of charm)
The chicken thing was delicious.
EMILY
It wasn't a chicken thing. It was salmon, zucchini, string beans, carrots, cherry tomatoes, asparagus, mushrooms and olives.
WALTER
Well it was good.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - 7 AM
Buddy is finishing his decorating. We pull out wide: No Santa Land has ever looked more beautiful. The most expensive merchandise has been used as bricks and mortar. A huge glitter sign says ""WELCOME SANTA! LOVE, BUDDY!!!""
Now, off in the distance, WE HEAR THE FAINT SOUND OF AN ANGEL SINGING.
Buddy perks up, training his ear, he slowly rises to his feet, as if following a butterfly, he meanders through the deserted aisles, more and more hypnotized as the angelic singing gets louder and louder and clearer and more beautiful.
Buddy pushes through the bathroom door, totally consumed by the greatest voice in the world.
REVEAL
Jovie is in the shower stall. Singing half of the classic duet, ""BABY, IT'S COLD OUTSIDE"". Buddy stands, hypnotized, outside the shower curtain, quietly joins in and sings the accompanying duet to himself. Eventually he can't help himself and belts out the chorus.
Jovie is silent and quickly twists off the shower and opens the curtain, wearing only a towel.
JOVIE
AHHHHHHHH!!!
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHH!!!
Jovie KICKS BUDDY in the NUTS and escapes. Buddy holds his crotch, confused and frightened.
EXT. GIMBELS - MORNING
A busy Manhattan morning. People are going back to work.
PAN TO
Behind the glass, an idyllic Christmas scene. Buddy is curled up in the faux snow, asleep -- mouth open and drooling, sweaty from the sun.
A MAN SQUINTS
At him through the window amazed at how life-like Buddy is. Buddy itches his crotch, then awakens to the staring man.
BUDDY
Ah! Holy fudge!
Buddy yawns and stretches ridiculously.
BUDDY
Good morning, everyone!
(looking off)
POV
Walter is walking along the sidewalk with his brief case.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Walter thinks he hears something, but continues. Buddy pounds hard on the window, trapped like a tiger. His voice echoes. Muffled like Dustin Hoffman in THE GRADUATE.
BUDDY
(muted)
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD!
Walter glances over, then stops in his tracks. It's Buddy. He runs.
INT. LOBBY - LATER
Buddy skips past the security guards with a box. Caught off guard, they have to lunge to grab him.
SECURITY GUARD #1
Hey!
BUDDY
(yelling back; fun)
Hey!!
(beat)
Hi, Glenn. Hi Chris! I just want to give my dad this present. I think he's mad at me...but he won't be after THIS.
SECURITY GUARD #1
You better leave that with us.
SECURITY GUARD #2
Yeah, he's real busy.
BUDDY
Oh, okay. Well, please tell him it's from me, and that I love him so much and that he's the greatest Dad in the world and that I love him. Okay?
SECURITY GUARD #1
Okay.
INT. GIMBELS - SANTA LAND - DAY
Buddy re-enters his new, transformed Santa Land. His face glows with satisfaction.
REVEAL
It's a smash hit. The visitors are ecstatic. 'Look at that!' 'Can you believe it?' etc. Everyone loves it. Except the Elf Manager, who complains to a co-worker.
ELF MANAGER
Who the hell took a dump in housewares?
Jovie walks up to Buddy.
JOVIE
Hey. I want to talk to you.
Buddy is now terrified by her.
BUDDY
Oh, uh, um, okay, uh...
(she lets him squirm)
What do you want to talk about?
JOVIE
What the hell do you think?
BUDDY
I know a pig who can run eleven miles an hour.
JOVIE
Why were you in the woman's locker room?
BUDDY
(sheephish)
I heard you singing.
JOVIE
Singing? Right. I'm sure it had nothing to do with me being naked. I should call the police.
(beat)
What were you doing here so early in the morning?
BUDDY
(re: epic Santa Land)
Making this.
JOVIE
You made this?
BUDDY
Yes...why were you here?
JOVIE
They turned my water off.
(she studies him)
You were standing there with your eyes closed. What is that, some kind of thing you do?
Buddy looks to the floor, and now up and into her eyes.
BUDDY
You have the most beautiful voice in the whole world.
Jovie looks at him, his innocence is contagious.
JOVIE
(sincere, compassionate)
You really were just listening to me, weren't you?
BUDDY
I'm sorry.
The Elf Manager walks over.
MANAGER
This is Santa Land, not stand-around-and-wear-pointy-ass-shoes land. Get busy. Santa's here.
BUDDY
SANTA?! Santa is HERE?!
Buddy sees the back of Santa enter a closed off gazebo. Children are already crowded around.
BUDDY
(happier than ever)
SANTA!
Buddy rushes towards Santa through the crowd, his eyes wide, almost breathless with excitement. Quickly he brushes off his uniform and straightens his cap.
BUDDY
Santa, it's me! Buddy!
Buddy slides the curtain open to reveal: a MAN dressed as Santa. The kids cheer. Buddy's smile drops.
BUDDY
Who the heck are you?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why, I'm Santa Claus.
BUDDY
Are not!
GIMBELS SANTA
Well, of course I am. Ho Ho Ho!
BUDDY
(furious)
If you're Santa, then tell me. What song did I sing for your birthday this year?
GIMBELS SANTA
Why you sang, uh, Happy Birthday?
BUDDY
(to the kids)
He's right.
'Santa' struts past Buddy and takes his chair.
GIMBELS SANTA
(under his breath)
Why don't you cool it, zippy.
(to the kids)
Ho Ho Ho!
The voice is wrong, the smell is wrong.
BUDDY
You're lying! I know it!
Buddy attacks. He grabs Santa's bear and it comes right off. Buddy looks at the beard in shock, like a horror movie.
BUDDY
(at the beard, horrified)
AAHHHH!!! Imposter! He's an imposter!!! His beard is fake! Come on, kids, get him!
The kids all pile on, wrestling Santa, loving it. Now the manager dives in and tries to help. Some parents and other elves try to contain the disaster in panic.
Jovie giggles. She is confused but intrigued by this mysterious stranger.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - GREENWAY PRESS - DAY
Walter sits behind his desk staring at the note that accompanied the package from Buddy. The package sits on the desk, still wrapped in a Gimbels box. The note says ""Dad, this is for you because you are my special someone.""
Walter unwraps the gift, then holds up a RED SLINKY NIGHTIE with fur where the nipples would be.
Deb enters and he scrambles to hide the nightie.
DEB
Hey the -- what's that?
WALTER
What's what?
(beat)
Intercom!
DEB
Right.
She leaves. Walter looks deeper into the box and sees a card. It's the old photo of a young Walter next to his smiling girlfriend - on the other side is a crayon drawing of Buddy.
DEB (O.S.)
(from intercom)
Walter, the police are on line one.
WALTER
The police?
(grabbing phone)
Hello? My son? Michael? Is he okay?
(listening)
An Elf? He's not my -- you know what? Keep him there. I'll be right down.
Deb peeks in.
DEB
What's going on?
WALTER
Nothing. I need to go.
(lying)
I need to swing by my apartment real quick...they're delivering a chair.
DEB
(smart ass)
A police chair?
WALTER
It's a regular chair. Okay?! Cancel my appointments.
INT. JAIL - DAY
A scary jail cell. Buddy looks around from his cot. Everything is cold and hard and ugly and mean.
And now he STARTS TO CRY. He sticks his face into the pillow and cries hard.
REVEAL
Another convict shares the cell with him. He stares at Buddy with disgust.
But now, slowly, it's contagious. The CONVICT CAN'T HELP IT AND HE STARTS TO CRY TOO.
Buddy hears the cell door clang open.
REVEAL
Walter stands at the open jail cell door.
BUDDY
Dad!!!
Buddy wipes his tears and rubs his face. Trying to look like a good son.
The convict wipes his tears away too, sitting up straight. But now starts crying again.
EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY
Walter marches out of the front doors, Buddy following closely behind, almost like a puppy dog trying to keep up.
Walter is about to burst but holds back, until they're clear of the station.
BUDDY
I'm so happy! I knew you'd come! I love that you came and I love you Dad! Know how much I love you?
(spreading his arms wide)
This much. Except my arms would have to be way longer, like pterodactyl wings --
WALTER
Alright, pal. Who the heck are you and what's your problem?
BUDDY
I'm Buddy. Your son.
WALTER
I already have a son!
BUDDY
Then who am I?
WALTER
Where did you get this picture?!
He holds up the picture he included in the gift.
BUDDY
Papa Elf gave it to me.
Walter shakes Buddy violently by the lapels. Buddy's scared.
WALTER
Is this some kind of game? What do you want, money?!
BUDDY
I just wanted to meet you...and I thought that, maybe, you might want to meet me...
Walter senses an element of truth in here somewhere.
WALTER
(serious)
You really believe this, don't you?
BUDDY
I thought we could make ginger bread houses and eat cookie dough and go ice skating and hold hands. I'm sorry if I made you mad.
WALTER
(conflicted)
Come with me.
Their silhouettes walk together away from camera. Buddy REACHES OUT TO HOLD HANDS, but Walter's hands stay in his trench coat...Buddy is still holding his hand out. Walter suddenly SMACKS BUDDY'S HAND DOWN.
INT. PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE - AN HOUR LATER
Buddy sits on the examining table as Walter watches.
PROP NOTE: Del Close's skull sits on a shelf in the B.G.
Buddy reaches into a jar of cotton balls and starts eating them quickly one at a time. Like cotton candy nuggets.
WALTER
Don't eat those.
Buddy goes to eat one more, Walter tries to grab his arm but Buddy fakes him out and eats it anyway.
BUDDY
Am I sick?
WALTER
YES.
(beat)
But that's not why we're here. We're here to test whether you're my son or not.
BUDDY
Why am I sitting on paper?
Buddy pulls the roll and paper spills out everywhere. The doctor and Walter try to stop him, but get tangled up.
DOCTOR
So it's clean for each patient that comes in. Try to sit still. I'm going to perform something called a 'finger prick.'
BUDDY
(happy)
Finger prick!
(to the Doctor)
Can I wear your head lamp?
DOCTOR
No.
BUDDY
Why?
DOCTOR
Just sit still.
BUDDY
Why is there a skeleton on the wall?
DOCTOR
I don't know but there just is.
BUDDY
What's his name?
WALTER
He doesn't have a name!
BUDDY
If I squint, he looks like a pirate flag. Arrgh!
DOCTOR
Walter, I can't do this if he's going to keep moving around.
WALTER
I'm sorry Ben. Buddy! Please!
BUDDY
(whispering)
He got mad at me.
WALTER
Buddy the sooner you sit still, the sooner we can clear up this horrible mess.
BUDDY
After this, can we eat sugar plums together?
WALTER
Sure! We'll eat sugar plums, and make ginger bread houses, and paint eggs!
BUDDY
That's Easter not -
The Doctor gives Buddy's finger a tiny prick.
BUDDY
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!
Buddy shoves the doctor over and stumbles around holding his finger and crying.
BUDDY
Boot straps! Snow flickers! Son of a cobbler!
INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER
Buddy holds his finger with a cotton ball for a moment. Then suddenly eats it.
Now he taps his finger and flips it around like it's dead, then turns to a LITTLE GIRL, 7, who is playing with her doll as her MOTHER fills out paperwork with the nurse.
BUDDY
My finger has a heartbeat.
GIRL
It won't hurt so much after a little. What's your name?
BUDDY
Buddy.
GIRL
I'm Carolyn.
BUDDY
And what do you want for Christmas?
CAROLYN
A Suzie-Talks-A-Lot.
BUDDY
I'll put in a good word with the big man.
CAROLYN
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
BUDDY
Oh, it's not a costume. I'm an Elf. Well, I'm a human, technically. But I was raised by Elves.
GIRL
(totally unfazed)
Oh. I'm a human...raised by humans.
BUDDY
Cool.
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter is waiting for the results.
WALTER
Well?
DOCTOR
Well...
(beat)
It's a boy.
The blood drains out of Walter's face.
WALTER
It's impossible.
(feeling faint)
Is the test ever wrong?
DOCTOR
No.
WALTER
My God. What'm I supposed to do? You saw the guy, he's certifiably insane!
DOCTOR
Walter, I've read about some things that suggest Buddy's behavior isn't necessarily that unusual.
WALTER
The man skips.
DOCTOR
It's rare, but there have been documented cases of people like your son.
WALTER
His name's BUDDY.
DOCTOR
Well, BUDDY's been denied a proper childhoood with you. It's possible he may feel he was never fully nurtured, causing an alternative personality to develop.
WALTER
An Elf.
DOCTOR
Yes.
(beat)
I think he's trying to return to a position of child-like dependency.
WALTER
So, let's get him some pills or whatever. I'll pay for them, it's not a problem.
DOCTOR
I think what he really needs is you. This is an extreme case. A rejection now could be especially traumatic.
WALTER
So, what do you want me to do, breast feed him?
DOCTOR
What if you let him visit you? Meet the family, that sort of thing. It may help him feel like he's a part of your life.
(off Walter's look)
He's your son Walter, it's not like he's going to just go away.
EXT. EMILY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Emily is leaving work, locking up the door. She turns to find Walter standing there at the bottom of the steps, hands in his pockets, smiling.
EMILY
What are you doing here?
WALTER
I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd walk you home.
EMILY
You thought you'd walk me home?
They begin to walk together.
WALTER
What, is that so weird?
EMILY
I've worked here for four years. You've never walked me anywhere.
WALTER
Well it's a nice night.
EMILY
What's wrong?
WALTER
Why does something have to be wrong? I just said, it's a nice night, I mean really!
EMILY
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
(taking his arm)
Thanks, this is really nice.
On Walter as he walks.
WALTER
Okay, something's a little wrong.
INT. HOBB'S RESIDENCE - LATER
They're arriving home.
EMILY
Oh, God...that's well, it's...it's Wonderful Walter. You have a son.
WALTER
Wonderful. That's one way to put it.
EMILY
Oh c'mon. This is incredible. It may be a little complicated, but it's nothing we can't handle.
WALTER
He thinks he's an Elf.
EMILY
I'm sorry, what?
WALTER
He thinks he's a Christmas Elf.
EMILY
Oh, I'm sure he doesn't really think...
Walter swings open the door to the apartment to reveal:
INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
BUDDY HAS BEEN BUSY. The place is a recycled winter wonderland. Yards of old garland has been meticulously strung throughout the apartment. Elaborate construction paper Christmas murals cover the walls. His sense of decorating is impeccable. Emily is floored.
MEANWHILE...in the kitchen, Buddy scoops globs of frosting into his mouth at a furious pace.
WALTER
Buddy?
Buddy looks up, drooling.
WALTER
This is Emily.
EMILY
(muffled, mouth full)
Emuree!
Swallows frosting hard. He jumps up and gives her a big hug.
BUDDY
Walter hasn't told me anything about you!!!
Meanwhile, Michael, their son, has arrived.
MICHAEL
Why is mom hugging Robin Hood?
INT. DINING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
Walter, Emily, Michael and Buddy are seated around the dining room table eating spaghetti.
BUDDY
...then I traveled through the seven levels of the candy cane forest, past the castle of the abominable snowman and past the sea of swirly, twirly gumdrops. And then I walked through the Lincoln tunnel. Can you pass the Coke pretty please?
Michael hands over a two-liter. Instead of pouring it in his glass, Buddy chugs the entire thing. The family watches, amazed.
EMILY
So, where exactly have you been for the last thirty years?
WALTER
The North Pole. He's an ""Elf"". That's where elves live.
BUDDY
He's right. Can you pass the maple syrup, pretty please.
EMILY
I'm sorry. I didn't set out any syrup. It's spaghetti.
BUDDY
That's okay, I think I have some...
Buddy pulls some syrup out of his breast pocket and pours it over his spaghetti. Walter and Michael share a disgusted look, the first time they've been in agreement on anything in a while.
EMILY
You like sugar, huh?
BUDDY
Is there sugar in syrup?
EMILY
Yes.
BUDDY
Then yes! We Elves try to stick to the four basic food groups: Candy, candy canes, candy corns and syrup.
EMILY
So, will you be staying with us, then?
WALTER
Emily.
BUDDY
You mean I can stay?
WALTER
Emily!
EMILY
Oh, don't be silly. Of course you can. How long do you think you'll be with us?
BUDDY
Well, I hadn't really planned it out, but I was thinking, like, forever?
WALTER
EMILY!?
EMILY
WHAT?!
WALTER
May I speak with you in the kitchen for a moment?
EMILY
Um, sure. Excuse me, Buddy.
Left alone, Buddy stares at Michael. Michael ignores him. Turning his whole chair away. Buddy looks around for a moment. And now suddenly BURPS so loud and long, it's insane.
BUDDY
Wow, did you hear that?
Yes, Michael did...
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Walter argues with Emily in hushed tones.
WALTER
Are you crazy? He can't stay here.
EMILY
Clearly he has some serious issues. We can't just kick him out in the snow.
WALTER
Why not? He loves the snow! He told me fifteen times!
EMILY
Seriously Walter! He's alone in New York. What's he supposed to do?
WALTER
That's his problem.
EMILY
He's your son. That means it's our problem.
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Michael sit in silence. Buddy isn't sure what to say.
BUDDY
I love you.
MICHAEL
Eat me.
BUDDY
Eat you? OKAY!
(playing, like the jungle)
I'm a Lion! Roar! CHOMP!
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
Buddy is on the living room couch. Walter is tucking him in, trying to leave.
BUDDY
Goodnight, Dad.
WALTER
Goodnight.
BUDDY
Tuck me in?
WALTER
What?!
BUDDY
I can't fall asleep if I'm not tucked in.
WALTER
I'm not tucking you in!
BUDDY
I promise I'll go right to sleep.
WALTER
(reluctantly)
Fine...
BUDDY
TICKLE FIGHT!!!
Walter fights him off, pissed.
WALTER
No. Buddy. Stop!
BUDDY
Sorry.
WALTER
Just lay down and go to sleep, okay?
BUDDY
Do you want to hear a story?
WALTER
No. When this light goes off, you are not getting up. Understand?
BUDDY
Understand.
(Walter flicks off light)
Dad?
(flicks light on)
WALTER
What?
BUDDY
I love you.
WALTER
Go to sleep.
BUDDY
Do you love me?
WALTER
Yeah sure. Now go to sleep.
BUDDY
How much do you love me. Like on a scale from one to ten?
WALTER
Well, I haven't known you for very long, but I would say my feelings are...significant.
BUDDY
(to himself; satisfied)
Significant
WALTER
Good night.
The lights go out for the last time. Walter closes the door and Buddy is alone in the DARK.
BUDDY
(in the dark)
Dad.
(long beat)
Dad?
(long beat)
DAD?
(long beat)
DAD?!
(longer beat)
DAD!!!!
The door suddenly swings open and light shoots into the room.
WALTER
WHAT!!!
BUDDY
Hi.
Walter slams the door. It's dark again.
BUDDY
Dad?
INT. HOBBS' KITCHEN - MORNING
Buddy has prepared a huge batch of spaghetti. The table is set up like a deranged thanksgiving feast. Buddy, the host, hurries around the kitchen as Emily eats.
EMILY
This sure is something, I'm usually the one making breakfast.
BUDDY
Want some more spaghetti?
EMILY
Um, sure, why not.
Buddy dumps more spaghetti on her plate. Then sprinkles it with candy snow caps.
EMILY
So how'd you sleep last night?
BUDDY
Great. I got a full forty minutes and still had time to build a rocking horse.
We see a painted and trimmed rocking horse in the corner.
EMILY
My gosh, you built that? Where did you get the wood?
WALTER (O.S.)
Why is the TV on the ground?
REVEAL:
The ENTERTAINMENT CENTER has been completely dismantled to provide wood for the rocking horse. Sawdust and paint litter the living room.
Walter walks into the kitchen, flabbergasted.
EMILY
Good morning, honey.
(she kisses her husband)
Buddy made us breakfast, isn't that nice?
Walter looks at the...spaghetti. So many things to say, but no place to begin.
EMILY
He packed us lunches too.
REVEAL:
THREE BAGS of spaghetti have each person's name written in calligraphy.
EMILY
Well, I gotta run. Thanks for breakfast, Buddy.
(grabbing her bag)
And the lunch!
She kisses him on the cheek and leaves.
BUDDY
Bye Emily!
Buddy takes a huge spoon and lifts three pounds of spaghetti into frame.
BUDDY
(to Walter)
So, how many scoops?
WALTER
I'm going to stick with coffee for now.
Now MICHAEL ENTERS. He doesn't care to notice the weird food.
MICHAEL
(to Walter, awkward)
I need my allowance.
WALTER
(awkward)
Did you do the recycling?
MICHAEL
Yeah, I did, okay?
Walter peels off a twenty and Michael immediately shoves it into his pocket.
BUDDY
How come you guys don't hug? We always hug in the morning.
WALTER
(lying)
We hugged earlier.
MICHAEL
(partner in crime)
Yeah, we hugged already. Bye.
BUDDY
Bye!
Walter and Buddy are now alone.
WALTER
Listen, Buddy, I wanted to talk to you.
BUDDY
Good, I wanted to talk to you too. I've planned our whole day...
He's made a list on the Etch-a-sketch.
BUDDY
First we make snow angels for two hours, then we go ice-skating and then we eat a log of toll house cookie dough as fast as we can and then, to wrap up the day, we snuggle.
WALTER
Buddy, I have to go to work.
(beat)
And another thing, if you're going to be staying here, you should think about getting rid of the costume. We've got neighbors and people around here, you know?
BUDDY
(looking at himself)
I've worn this my whole life.
WALTER
Yeah, well, you're not in the North Pole anymore.
Buddy is unsure.
WALTER
You said you wanted to make me happy, didn't you?
BUDDY
More than anything.
WALTER
Then lose the tights...as soon as possible.
BUDDY
As soon as possible?
WALTER
As soon as possible.
BUDDY
(sighing)
Yes, papa.
Walter turns and faces camera, pouring coffee. Behind him, Buddy TAKES HIS GREEN TIGHTS OFF and stands there NAKED from the waist down. (The audience is spared the details).
From the rear, Emily re-enters the kitchen and sees Buddy from behind.
EMILY
I almost forg --- AHHHHH!!!!!!
Walter spills his coffee and turns to see Buddy from the front.
WALTER
AHHHHHHH!!!!
BUDDY
(as if it's a game)
AHHHHH!!!!
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
Walking to work, Walter answers his cell phone.
WALTER
(answering his cell)
Walter Hobbs.
BUDDY (O.S.)
(from phone)
It worked! It's you!
We intercut Buddy at home, he's shocked by the technology.
WALTER
How'd you get this number?
BUDDY
Emily left an emergency list.
WALTER
Is there an emergency?
BUDDY
There's a horrible sound coming from the evil box by the window! It sounds like this: ERIEKKKCTH!
Walter's ear is trashed before he can pull the phone away.
WALTER
It's not evil. It's the radiator. The heat makes noise when it comes on.
BUDDY
No it's not. Wait yes it is, you were right. Everything's fine!
WALTER
I'm hanging up now.
BUDDY
Okay, I love you, I'll call you in five minutes, I love you!
WALTER
You don't need to call me, Buddy, okay?
BUDDY
Good idea. You call me.
WALTER
Okay, I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I have a present for you when you get home!
WALTER
I'm hanging up.
BUDDY
I love you!
EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE PRIVATE SCHOOL - LATER
Dozens of kids stream out of school.
Michael is in the middle of the crowd when he hears his name from across the street.
BUDDY (O.S.)
MICHAEL! MICHAEL!
He looks over and sees Buddy cutting through traffic.
MICHAEL
(turns away in embarrassment)
Oh man.
BUDDY
It's me, your brother! Hey, Michael!
Kids start to notice and begin laughing, Michael can't bare it. Michael walks away, ignoring Buddy.
BUDDY
Michael! Wait up!
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
Michael is walking through the park, Buddy trails twelve feet behind, sort of hiding behind trees. But not really.
Michael finally turns and confronts him.
MICHAEL
LEAVE!
BUDDY
How about I leave, then you count to ten and come find me?
MICHAEL
This isn't a game, spaz. Leave NOW. For REAL.
BUDDY
You really want me to leave
MICHAEL
Yes.
BUDDY
(sad)
Oh. Okay. I'll uh, leave, then. I'm sorry.
Just then, a SNOWBALL WHACKS MICHAEL IN THE SHOULDER.
EDGE OF THE RAVINE
A big bunch of JACKASS WANNA-BE teenagers look down at them and laugh.
MICHAEL
Oh, no. These guy are bad news. We better get out of here.
Thump! Michael gets hit in the head.
BUDDY
Ow! PEANUT BRITTLE! SON OF A NUTCRACKER!
Now a barrage of snowballs rain down upon them and they dive behind a fallen tree trunk as snow missiles rip into the barricade.
BUDDY
Dive!
MICHAEL
(genuinely worried)
There are too many of them!
BUDDY
We can do this! Make as many snowballs as you can!
Michael quickly sculpts two snowballs.
WE PAN BACK
To see Buddy has already rounded out a pile of THIRTY.
BUDDY
Ready?
MICHAEL
Yeah.
WIDE SHOT
We can't see Buddy, but we can see the snowballs shooting out of his bunker like a machine gun. A Nolan Ryan fastball ever 1.5 Seconds.
A series of targets explode with precision as this blur of snowballs hits guts, butts, nuts and faces. A kid raises a snowball and it immediately explodes out of his hand. This is the one thing Buddy's actually better at than hockey.
Michael stands to launch one. Exposing himself.
BUDDY
Noooo!
Michael is frozen with shock as a HUGE KID winds up and releases a snowball right at him. Buddy fires a snowball that hits the incoming snowball exploding both of them in mid-air like a patriot missile. They both sit panting.
BUDDY
He's bunkered in! I'm going to flank around from the East. If I don't make it, tell my Dad I love him.
Buddy jumps and charges - and now Michael follows. Buddy descends upon the guy, launching a flurry of snow. The guy finally raises his arms and steps up slowly in surrender.
Buddy looks at the GUY WITH HIS ARMS UP, then winds up and explodes a snowball off his chest at close range.
SNOWBALL GUY
Ow!
(holding his chest)
Hey, I surrendered!
BUDDY
(to Michael)
What does surrendered mean?
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter does some paperwork, then hits the intercom.
WALTER
Can you bring me in a bottle of water please?
DEB (O.S.)
(from the intercom)
Fulton Greenway is on his way in.
Fulton Greenway? Walter immediately loses blood in his face.
WALTER
Fulton Greenway? Why didn't you tell me?
DEB (O.S.)
He just showed up. What size water?
WALTER
When's he coming in?
DEB (O.S.)
Now.
WALTER
What do you mean now?
Walter buttons his suit and checks his reflection for nose hairs.
DEB (O.S.)
I mean now. What size?
FULTON GREENWAY (O.S.)
Hobbs!
FULTON GREENWAY, the cut-throat looking owner of the company enters the office. This guy owns Greenway Press, among other things.
WALTER
Fulton! What a great surprise!
FULTON GREENWAY
I haven't seen you since the retreat. You're looking good.
WALTER
Thanks, you too. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
FULTON GREENWAY
Well, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.
WALTER
Your niece. I don't think I've met her.
FULTON GREENWAY
She's six.
Fulton tosses 'THE PUPPY AND THE PIGEON (the flawed book from earlier) onto Walter's desk. Uh oh.
FULTON GREENWAY
She wants to know how a certain puppy and a certain pigeon escaped the clutches of a certain evil witch.
WALTER
Believe me, we've already started looking at new printers. This one's obviously gotten sloppy.
Greenway holds up the proofs, signed by Walter.
FULTON GREENWAY
Maybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.
WALTER
(forcing a laugh)
What a disaster, huh? Twenty-five years in publishing, never seen anything like it. Well, I guess you can't bat a thousand, right?
Fulton Greenway nods skeptically. Walter adjusts in his seat.
FULTON GREENWAY
I got news for you, even if those two pages were in there, that book still would have sucked. I read it. I'll tell you, I wish all the pages were missing.
(Walter's dying)
Have you seen the numbers from this quarter?
WALTER
They should be coming in today.
FULTON GREENWAY
(holds up the numbers)
They're in!
WALTER
That good, huh?
FULTON GREENWAY
The Pigeon and the Friggin' Puppy is tanking hard, Hobbs. My people estimate we'll be posting a minus eight for this quarter. A minus eight cannot happen.
WALTER
Well, we'll bounce back. We always do.
FULTON GREENWAY
We're not going to 'bounce back.' We're going to get a new book before the end of the quarter.
WALTER
Before the end of this quarter?
FULTON GREENWAY
I'll be back in town on the twenty fourth. At that time, I'd love to hear, in great detail, exactly what your plans are for this new book.
WALTER
But that's Christmas Eve.
FULTON GREENWAY
And?
WALTER
Hey, no problem. It'll be fun to have you in the loop.
INT. GIMBELS - LATER THAT DAY
Buddy and Michael are goofing around inside Gimbels. Buddy pegs him with a dodge ball. Michael laughs and pegs him back.
MICHAEL
(looking at toy bugs)
Hey, look at this, it's a big mosquito!
BUDDY
What's a mosquito?
MICHAEL
They land on your arm, then stick their needle face down through your skin, suck your blood out and then fly away.
BUDDY
That's a scary toy.
MICHAEL
It's not just a toy. They're real. They're everywhere in the summer.
BUDDY
(horrified)
OH MY GOD.
EXT. GIMBELS - CONTINUOUS
They leave the toy section and walk toward the SANTA LAND that Buddy built. We see the sign has been awkwardly changed to 'Welcome, Santa. Love GIMBELS.'
BUDDY
I wish Dad were here.
MICHAEL
Why?
BUDDY
He's the greatest Dad in the world.
MICHAEL
Are you kidding? He's the worst dad in the world.
BUDDY
What do you mean?
MICHAEL
All he does is work.
BUDDY
Working is fun.
MICHAEL
Not the way he does it. All he cares about is the money. He doesn't care about me, he doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about anybody.
BUDDY
Well, he is on the naughty list.
AND NOW WE SPOT JOVIE
From a distance. She looked adorable before, but this time we're serious.
MICHAEL
You like her?
BUDDY
Like who?
MICHAEL
The girl you're staring at.
BUDDY
Um, yes.
MICHAEL
Why don't you ask her out?
BUDDY
Out to where?
MEANWHILE
Jovie has spotted Buddy. She gives him a shy wave. And now she's WALKING OVER to them.
BUDDY
(flipping out)
We should leave. I need to leave.
MICHAEL
Don't leave! Ask her out!
BUDDY
Out?
MICHAEL
On a date, you know, to eat food.
BUDDY
(Jovie's almost there)
Food.
MICHAEL
(whispering)
If she says yes, you're in. It's like a secret code girls have.
JOVIE
Well look who it is.
BUDDY
Hi Jovie. This is --
Michael has ditched out. Buddy is on his own.
BUDDY
...that's my brother, Michael, over there.
JOVIE
I was wondering if I'd ever see you again. So, did Gimbels give you your job back?
BUDDY
No, but it worked out pretty good. They gave me a restraining order.
JOVIE
You really should get out of here.
BUDDY
But I really wanted to see you. You're beautiful and I feel warm when I'm around you. You make my tongue swell up.
Jovie is embarrassed.
JOVIE
You are the weirdest guy I've ever met in my life.
BUDDY
Weird, like, good?
JOVIE
(smiling)
I haven't decided.
BUDDY
So, do you want to eat food?
JOVIE
Do I want to eat food?
BUDDY
You know...
(winking)
The code...
JOVIE
(letting that slide)
I just took my lunch break.
BUDDY
(defeated)
Oh, right. I follow.
JOVIE
(then)
But I'm free Thursday night.
A wry smile slowly breaks across Buddy's face. And then he suddenly explodes.
BUDDY
(celebrating; ridiculous)
YYEEESSSSSSSSS!
INT. HOBBS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Walter enters and sees Buddy and Michael as they hoist an enormous FOURTEEN FOOT TALL CHRISTMAS TREE into the corner. It scrapes the ceiling as they wedge it in place.
WALTER
What the hell is that?
MICHAEL
A Christmas tree!
WALTER
A Christmas tree?
MICHAEL
Buddy chopped it down in the park!
Buddy smiles at Walter, Walter does not smile back.
INT. WALTER AND EMILY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Michael and Emily are having a heated discussion.
EMILY
I don't know what you're so worked up about. They're just having a little fun.
WALTER
Fun? Felonies are fun now? I thought felonies were felonies?
EMILY
Okay, the tree thing was bad. We'll have to plant another one. But at least
Michael's happy for once.
(beat)
It's amazing what a little attention will do.
WALTER
What's that supposed to mean?
EMILY
Well, you haven't exactly been there for him lately. He's a kid Walter, he's not going to raise himself.
WALTER
Oh! So let's allow a deranged Elf-man to raise him. Great idea! Maybe we should pull Michael out of school so they can commit felonies full time!
EMILY
I think you're jealous.
WALTER
Jealous? Of Buddy? The man is wearing tights.
INT. LIVING ROOM - MEANWHILE
Buddy uses a drill to secure the trunk to the floor. ZZZZRRrrrr. He then stands at a distance. Like a high jumper, holding a star for the top of the tree in hand.
POV
He eyes a mini-trampoline. Then the top of the tree. And now looks at the star in his hand. This has bad news written all over it.
MICHAEL
Are you sure about this? Maybe we can get a ladder.
BUDDY
A ladder? What's fun about a ladder?
(concentrating)
Ready?
(taking off)
WATCH!!!!
Buddy runs, hits the trampoline, launches himself way off target, shooting a sharp angle into the nearest wall. BAM! HE falls behind the couch and out of sight.
BUDDY (O.S.)
I'm okay.
(then)
I found a quarter!
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
WALTER
What was that noise?
EMILY
Sounded like Buddy slamming into the wall and falling behind the couch.
WALTER
That guy's a liability. There's no way we're leaving him alone here tomorrow. He'll trash the place. Maybe you should take tomorrow off and, you know, watch him.
EMILY
I can't just take off work. I'm going upstate tomorrow for budget meetings.
WALTER
Well I can't stay home. I'm one bad pitch away from getting fired.
EMILY
Why don't you take him to work with you?
WALTER
Take him to work with me?
EMILY
Yeah, I bet he'd like it.
WALTER
Absolutely never.
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY
The ELEVATOR DOOR DINGS open to reveal Walter & Buddy. Buddy sports a new suit. He looks ever bit the professional as he enters with his father.
CO-WORKER
Hey, Walter.
WALTER
Hey, Jack.
BUDDY
Hello, Jack!
Another co-worker, #2, nods hello.
WALTER
Hey, Sarah.
BUDDY
Hi, Sarah. I love that purple dress. It's purplie.
CO-WORKER #3
How's it going, Walter?
WALTER
Hello, Francisco.
BUDDY
Hey, Francisco! That's fun to say! Francisco!
WALTER
(whispering)
Could you at least lose that damn hat?
BUDDY
I like the hat.
(off Walter's look)
I could try, but I really like it.
INT. HOBBS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Walter sits down at his scattered desk. Deb follows him in with his morning cup of coffee.
WALTER
Thanks, Deb.
BUDDY
Good morning, Deb! You have a very pretty face! You should be on a Christmas card!
DEB
Uh, thanks.
She leaves. Walter watches as Buddy grabs ten different books and immediately decides they're boring.
BUDDY
(to himself)
Fran-cis-co.
WALTER
We're cutting down on your sugar intake.
BUDDY
Why is your name on the door?
WALTER
I bought that door. My name's there so no one else steals it.
BUDDY
Is that a joke, Dad?
WALTER
Yes.
BUDDY
This is your office, isn't it?
WALTER
Well how about that? He's understanding sarcasm.
BUDDY
So what are we going to build?
WALTER
This really isn't that kind of work.
THE PHONE RINGS, Buddy beats Walter to it.
BUDDY
(super-fast into phone)
Buddy the Elf! What's your favorite color?
Walter hangs up the phone.
WALTER
Please don't touch anything!
(beat)
Listen, Buddy, have you ever seen a mail room before?
BUDDY
(excited)
A mail room? No.
WALTER
Mail from all over the world gets sorted all in one place! And some of the bins are shiny.
BUDDY
(dreaming)
Shiny...
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Yelling voices, loud machinery and blaring hip-hop fill the place. YOUNG, URBAN WORKERS in criminal apparel wrap and unwrap massive parcels.
The elevator dings open to reveal Buddy, alone, frightened. The floor manager, CHUCK, spots Buddy.
FLOOR MANAGER
You Buddy?
(Buddy nods)
Well come on out of the elevator then.
BUDDY
Okay.
Floor manager leads Buddy over to the main work area.
FLOOR MANAGER
Welcome to the pit.
TREY, an enormous, bald African-American man and CRAIG, a bald, wiry kid with a neck tattoo, stop their sorting and look up at Buddy with threatening glares.
FLOOR MANAGER
...over here is the trench. All the mail comes out of the shooter. You scan and find the floor each piece is moving to. Put her in the canister and shove her up the tube with the same number, got it?
BUDDY
Yeah! I like tubes and cannisters and numbers. This place reminds me of Santa's workshop. Except here it smells like mushrooms and everyone wants to hurt me.
INT. CONVERENCE ROOM - DAY
It's a writer's meeting. The three writers: EUGENE, HUSKEY and MORRIS sit around a table with Walter.
WALTER
So, we've got Greenway coming in tomorrow. Where are we at?
EUGENE
Well, Huskey and I were brain storming and we came up with what I think is a pretty big idea.
HUSKEY
You're going to love this.
MORRIS
I heard it already and I think it's fantastic.
WALTER
(pleasantly surprised)
Okay, great. Let's hear it.
HUSKEY
Picture this...
(long dramatic pause)
We bring in Miles Finch.
WALTER
The Miles Finch?
EUGENE
(excited)
The Golden Ghost.
HUSKEY
We bring him in.
MORRIS
He's written more classics than Dr. Seuss. It may not be easy, but we think it's worth a shot.
WALTER
So, lemme get this straight. You guys are pitching me the idea of another writer?
EUGENE
Yeah.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch.
Walter looks like he's about to get angry...but then:
WALTER
I like it.
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - MAIL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
This is Buddy at his best. He stuffs and launches mail into tubes with incredible speed and efficiency. No one's ever seen anything like it.
Almost without noticing, Buddy begins singing to himself.
BUDDY
(singing)
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me...
He feels Trey's stares and catches himself. He turns to find a stone cold killer glare.
TREY
(beat)
A partridge in a pear tree.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Walter and the writers are huddled around a speaker phone.
EUGENE
My favorite book of yours has to be Gus' Pickles. It was existential, yet so accessible.
HUSKEY
It's a thrill just to be talking to you on our speaker phone.
WALTER
So what do you think? Can you fly in tomorrow morning?
A beat, and then Miles Finch's voice comes over the speaker phone, mysterious and brilliant.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
(intercom)
I'll give you five hours tomorrow, not a minute more.
WALTER
(relieved)
Great.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'd like a black S-500 to receive me at the airport. I need the interior of that car to be 71 degrees.
WALTER
We can do that.
DEB (O.S.)
(over intercom; BEEP!)
Walter! There's a situation downstairs.
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'm sorry, what? Hello?
WALTER
(in panic)
Deb, hang up! Miles stay on!
MILES FINCH
I do not hold! Do not put me on hold!
DEB (O.S.)
We have a problem in the mail room.
HUSKEY
What's going on?
WALTER
(pointing to Huskey)
Do not talk!
(into phone)
Deb, please hang up!
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
That's it, I'm gone!
WALTER
MILES! WAIT!
Dramatic pause. Is he gone?
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
I'll be there tomorrow.
(phew!)
71 degrees...
He clicks off.
DEB (O.S.)
Sir, Chuck in the mail room.
WALTER
Okay, okay! I'm going to the stupid mail room!
INT. MAILROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Buddy's singing has spread like wild fire. The whole mailroom is now singing a beautiful rendition of THE TWELVE DAYS OF CHRISTMAS. Everyone is circled around, cheering and singing.
TREY
Eleven-pipers-piping...
CRAIG
Ten-lords-a-leaping...
LAZY-EYED CREEP
Nine-ladies-dancing...
GANG BANGER
Eight-maids-milking...
TREY
Six-geese-a-laying...
EVERYBODY
FIVE GOLDEN RINGS!!!
REVEAL
Walter is watching this display. The workers begin to notice Walter standing. One by one, they stop, until Buddy is left to continue alone.
BUDDY
(as he squat-thrusts)
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love...gave...to...
Buddy notices his dad and smiles. Walter does not.
EXT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy walks up to the buzzer panel until he finds the name Jovie Davis.
He presses the buzzer BRRR!!!! It scares the hell out of him. He jumps back and is then frightened to death as he is confronted by the sight of a display window full of Chinese roasted ducks. Still sporting heads. Jovie steps out.
BUDDY
(taking her in)
You look miraculous.
JOVIE
Miraculous? Thanks.
(they start walking)
So what do you feel like doing?
BUDDY
I have a few ideas.
JOVIE
Well, I'm up for anything.
BUDDY
Really?
JOVIE
Sure.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
Jovie sits blind-folded at the counter as Buddy sets up a cup of coffee before her.
BUDDY
Don't look. Just reach out and take a sip.
JOVIE
(smiles)
What are you doing?
She takes a sip.
BUDDY
Well?
JOVIE
It tastes like a crappy cup of coffee.
BUDDY
Ha ha.
He removes the blindfold.
JOVIE
It is a crappy cup of coffee.
EXT. MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
Buddy is running around and around a revolving door. Loving every moment.
Jovie watches, confused. Smirking slightly as OTHERS wait and grow annoyed with him.
EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
Buddy pulls her by the arm.
BUDDY
Check out the size of this...
He shows her a pine tree decorated for Christmas.
BUDDY
Can you believe it?
JOVIE
(nonplussed)
Come with me.
EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - LATER
Jovie leads him around the corner.
REVEAL:
ROCKEFELLER CENTER. Buddy sees the GIANT CHRISTMAS TREE for the first time.
BUDDY
Wow, that looks wondrous.
They share their first genuine smile.
EXT. ICE RINK - LATER
Buddy and Jovie are skating, having fun. Jovie accidentally slides, BUMPING BUDDY. Buddy bumps her back. She bumps him back harder. It escalates until she checks him off of his feet. THEY FALL to the ice together, Jovie on top, nose to nose.
They look into each other's eyes and Buddy abruptly plants a kiss on Jovie's cheek.
BUDDY
Sorry.
JOVIE
You missed.
BUDDY
I missed?
JOVIE
Yeah.
With that, She leans in and kisses him full on the mouth. Buddy's hear fills his whole chest.
DISSOLVE TO:
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY
Walter and the writers sit in silence, waiting. Walter checks his watch. Still waiting.
HUSKEY
I sure hope that car's seventy one degrees.
EXT. MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS
The door swings open with a purpose:
REVEAL
Buddy. The morning after. Steps into the door frame like ELVIS. A changed man. WE follow him down the street. Buddy's not skipping, he's SKIPPING.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Walter and the writer's continue to wait. Nervous hand wringing.
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
We see only the shoes of the infamous Miles Finch march through the company, echoing throughout the halls.
We see some of the workers' reactions.
This is epic.
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
More nervous waiting.
EUGENE
I should have brought my camera.
More silence...and then:
MILES FINCH (O.S.)
Alright. Let's do this.
REVEAL
Miles Finch is FOUR FEET TALL. He may be very small, but in this business, he is a monster.
WALTER
Miles! Thanks so much for coming. We're all big fans. I'm Walter. We spoke on the phone.
MILES FINCH
Yeah, yeah. Great. Let's get the uh --
(i.e. Cash)
Taken care of so we can get started.
Walter pulls out a small manila envelope stacked with cash and slides it across the table. The three other writers watch it slide across, moving their heads like a tennis match, until Miles stops it with his hand.
Miles checks the money and tucks it into his vest pocket.
MILES FINCH
Okay, cool.
(right to the point)
So what have you guys got so far?
WALTER
(to Huskey)
Go ahead.
HUSKEY
(nervous)
Okay, well, we were thinking something like this: we open on a young Tomato. He's been through some tough times on the farm.
MILES FINCH
No tomatoes. Too vulnerable. Kids are already vulnerable.
WALTER
That's what we were kind of thinking.
MILES FINCH
And no farms, everyone's pushing small-town rural. Any farm book will just be white noise.
WALTER
Okay. Well, we don't have much time. Do you have any ideas?
MILES FINCH
I've got five or six strong starts. I'm sure we can put something very solid together. No problem.
(Walter is very happy)
There's one idea I'm especially psyched about. It's one of those ideas where you're just like YES!
WALTER
What is it?!
MILES FINCH
I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
BUDDY (O.S.)
Dad!
Walter is still fixated on Miles, waiting for his golden ticket. Finally he snaps out of it and looks at Buddy.
BUDDY
I'm in love! I'm in love! And I don't care who knows it!
WALTER
Not now, Buddy. Why don't you go...uh, back to the pit? I'll come visit you later, okay?
Buddy goes to leave, but before he does, he NOTICES A FOUR FOOT TALL MILES FINCH.
BUDDY
(looking at little Miles)
You didn't tell me you had Elvises working here!
MILES FINCH
(icy stare)
Boy you are hilarious, my friend.
WALTER
So what are you saying, Miles? Let's get back to the book.
MILES FINCH
(back on track)
Okay, at the top of the cover is the title, et this, ready? A --
BUDDY
Boy, the candy canes here in New York just don't measure up to Elf standards, do they?
MILES FINCH
(another icy stare)
Gee whiz, we're all laughing our butts off.
WALTER
Buddy! Please. Just go in the basement!
BUDDY
Do you guys have an Elf hockey league here? I'm just curious.
MILES FINCH
Hey, jack weed. I may be ""little,"" but I get more action in a week than you've had your whole life. I've got houses in LA, Hawaii, Vail and Paris, with a seventy inch plasma screen in each one of them. So I suggest you wipe that friggin' smile off your face before I bite it off.
(leaning in)
You feelin' strong, friend? Call me ELF one more time.
BUDDY
(to his Dad)
Boy, he's an angry Elf.
Miles suddenly ATTACKS! Buddy tries to avoid him, but Miles is surprisingly strong, flipping Buddy over the table.
Now out of nowhere, Buddy winds up like Popeye and decks him across the face. Buddy looks at his own fist in horror.
BUDDY
(looking at his fist)
What have I done?
This gives Miles permission to deliver five QUICK HOCKEY PUNCHES to the face. Buddy is down for the count.
Miles stands, victorious and grabs his coat.
MILES FINCH
All of you can kiss my vertically challenged ass.
Miles takes the envelope of money out of his jacket and pretends to toss it on the table, pump faking. Then returns it to his vest pocket and walks out.
WALTER
Miles! Wait!
BUDDY
(to himself)
A South Pole Elf.
Buddy rubs his chin and stands to face his father.
BUDDY
You're really red.
WALTER
DAMMIT BUDDY! THIS TIME YOU REALLY DID IT! GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!
BUDDY
(scared)
Where do you want me to go?
WALTER
Go anywhere! I don't care if you're crazy. I don't care if you're an elf!! I don't care if you're my son!!! JUST STAY OUT OF MY LIFE!!!
This one stings hard. Buddy runs off, upset like never before.
EXT. MANHATTAN - LATER
QUICK CUTS
Buddy walking through the city, devastated.
INT. WALTER'S OFFICE - LATER
Walter is stressed, rubbing his face, pulling his hair out, on the phone. He's losing his career, and now he knows he's hurt Buddy.
WALTER
(into phone)
I can't really talk right now.
INT. EMILY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
INTERCUT with Emily.
EM
You're gonna be home for dinner, aren't you? I mean it is Christmas Eve.
WALTER
It looks like it's gonna be a late one.
EM
Oh. Do you wanna send Buddy home early?
WALTER
(riddled with guilt)
Oh, um, we'll talk about it later. I gotta go, okay?
Suddenly the three writers rush in. Walter hangs up.
HUSKEY
Walter! Huge news. The cleaning man just found this!
WALTER
What is it?
Huskey hands over a black journal and Walter flips through it.
HUSKEY
Miles Finch's notebook! He left it in the conference room. There's three great pitches in the first page alone!
MORRIS
Plus we've got his doodle-squiggles all over the back cover! We're not sure what they mean, but they're probably gold!
HUSKEY
I say we o with the first pitch in there! It's a slam dunk!
EUGENE
I agree, a home run.
MORRIS
Monster.
WALTER
How much time do we have?
HUSKEY
Forty-five.
WALTER
Let's get some story boards ready.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
Buddy steps out of the closet...
REVEAL
He's wearing his ELF SUIT again. Never before has an Elf looked so sad.
Buddy sits at the table and unfurls some long paper. He dips a quill pen in to some ink and writes in PERFECT CALLIGRAPHY.
WE HEAR BUDDY'S VOICE AS HE WRITES.
BUDDY (V.O.)
I'm sorry I ruined your lives... And crammed eleven cookies into the VCR. I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere. I will never forget you. Love, Buddy.
Buddy sets down the scroll, and now, as if sealing it, sets his SNOW GLOBE down on the crease.
Buddy walks out into the night.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
In his Elf Suit, Buddy trudges through the stormy New York night. The wind viciously blows. Buddy walks against it, the snow blowing into him.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - LATER
Michael comes home, carrying a bunch of presents. He looks around the empty house.
MICHAEL
Buddy?
INT. GREENWAY PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
Fulton Greenway and his crew sit at the end of the conference room, looking sharp as a tack. Walter is at the other end, looking even sharper.
GREENWAY
As you know, we need a big launch, fast. To get this company back on track. So, I think I speak for my fellow board members when I say...
(dramatic pause)
This better be good.
Walter smiles, then re-checks his storyboards, beaming.
WALTER
I'm confident, sir. You will not be disappointed.
GREENWAY
Let's hear it.
WALTER
My pleasure. I'll start with the cover, okay? Picture this: A--
MICHAEL (O.S.)
Dad?!
Walter turns.
His son Michael is standing in the room.
WALTER
Michael?
MICHAEL
Buddy left!
WALTER
What?
Michael holds up the calligraphy scroll Buddy wrote. Everyone is confused.
MICHAEL
He wrote this note! He left his snow globe! He's gone!
WALTER
Okay, listen. Let me finish this meeting and we'll figure this out. Okay?
MICHAEL
Finish your meeting?!
(beat)
How'd I know you were going to say that?
Michael turns to leave, furious. Walter is torn...
WALTER
Michael! Wait!
Michael stops in his tracks, giving his dad a chance. Hopeful.
WALTER
(to the board)
Mr. Greenway, we have to reschedule this.
GREENWAY
We don't have time to reschedule! I want to hear the damn thing NOW!
(to Michael)
Son, this has to wait.
WALTER
No it doesn't. We'll do this some other time, Mr. Greenway.
GREENWAY
This isn't happening. You're going to sit in that chair and pitch me a hit friggin' book! NOW!
WALTER
Mr. Greenway, with all due respect, KISS MY ASS!
MICHAEL
Kiss my ass, too!!
INT. GREENWAY PRESS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael walk down the hall, triumphantly, together.
GREENWAY (O.S.)
(in the distance)
If you walk out, Hobbs, you can never come back to Greenway!
EXT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
Buddy's on the bridge, looking down. Contemplating the worst of all possible conclusions. WAVES crash and churn far below.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael are walking fast, searching, half-jogging. Losing hope. Where's Buddy?
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy closes his eyes tight, then looks up, a tear streams down his cheek.
SUDDENLY SOMETHING CATCHES HIS EYE.
A distant point with a glowing trail of smoke. Buddy narrows his eyes to see as the point grows as it approaches. It slowly reveals itself to be SANTA'S SLEIGH!
Tangled with reindeer, fish-tailing, and CRASHING!
BUDDY
Santa?!
EXT. MANHATTAN - MEANWHILE
Walter is facing away from the park, in the sky behind him is the diving sled. Michael sees this all. His face is aglow.
MICHAEL
Oh...My...God!
WALTER
(missing it; turning)
What was that?!
In shock, without a word, Michael takes off running toward the park.
WALTER
What happened?
(running after him)
Michael, wait up!?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, running, frantic, comes upon Santa's SLEIGH in the distance. The reindeer peacefully graze as Santa struggles with the smoking sleigh. The landing looks to have been rough as the sleigh has dug a deep fifty foot long trench in the snow and dirt.
Santa frantically attempts to repair the problem with his head hidden under a hood panel. Smoke rises.
BUDDY
Santa!
Santa jumps out from under the hood clutching a TIRE IRON.
SANTA
Back off slick!!!
He then recognizes him.
SANTA
Buddy?? Is that you?
BUDDY
Are you okay?
SANTA
Boy am I glad to see you. The Claus-o-meter suddenly dropped down to zero. There's almost no Christmas Spirit in New York. The strain was too much, the engine broke free of her mounts. I need an Elf's help.
BUDDY
But I'm not an Elf, Santa. I can't do anything right.
SANTA
Buddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I've ever met, and the only one who I would have working on my sleight.
BUDDY
Really?
SANTA
Really. Will you fix the engine for me, Buddy?
BUDDY
I will. Papa taught me how.
SANTA
You'll have to find it first, she dropped off back there a ways.
Buddy runs off into the woods.
INT. JOVIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Jovie walks out of the kitchen as NEW YORK ONE drones quietly on the TV. IT features a breaking NEWS STORY set in CENTRAL PARK. A REMOTE REPORTER is on the scene.
REMOTE REPORTER
New York One has been unable to confirm anything, but it's obvious that something has happened in Central Park. Authorities are clearing out the park and all entrances have been barricaded. As you can see, quite a crowd is starting to gather.
The camera pans and we see a huge crowd is gathering outside Central Park, held back by barricades and police.
The female reporter steps over to a Latino man, who holds his 5-year old son in his arms.
REMOTE REPORTER
Sir, you say you were able to get a first-hand look at what happened? Tell me, what did you see?
LATINO MAN
I was walking along, and I saw a huge flash, and then something came swooping down...
REMOTE REPORTER
Something? Do you mean an airplane or a helicopter?
LATINO MAN
It wasn't like that. IT sounds crazy, but it looked like, uh...
He's too embarrassed.
LATINO CHILD
It was Santa's Sleigh!
REMOTE REPORTER
(dismissive)
Aren't you a cutie.
(listening to earpiece)
This could be a big hoax. I'm now told we have some amateur footage of a strange man dressed as an Elf. Let's take a look.
ON THE SCREEN
A zoomed-in blurry image of Buddy running. He trips and falls on his face like an idiot. Then scrambles up and runs into the woods. Sort of like that old Big Foot Footage, if he had done a face plant. It ends in a freeze frame of Buddy's FACE as he looks over a shoulder.
They re-play the footage over and over and over again.
JOVIE
(seeing Buddy)
Oh my God.
EXT. ENGINE SITE - CENTRAL PARK -
CONTINUOUS
Walter and Michael stop at a smoking object in the snow. It's SANTA'S MISSING ENGINE.
WALTER
What the...
BUDDY (O.S.)
You found it!
Michael and Walter look up to see Buddy approaching them. Michael runs to him with a hug.
MICHAEL
Buddy! You're here!
BUDDY
(in a hurry)
There's something I've got to tell you guys!
WALTER
(ignoring; focused)
No. Me first. There's something I want to tell you right now! I take back everything I said. You may be a little...how do you say... chemically imbalanced. But you've been right about a lot of things. I promise you, I'm going to be making some changes in my life. I don't want you to leave... I need you. You're my son and I love you.
They hug. This means more Buddy than anyone could ever know.
SANTA (O.S.)
(from a foggy distance)
Buddy?! How are we looking?? We gotta move!
WALTER
Who was that?
EXT. SANTA'S CRASH SITE - CONTINUOUS
Buddy leads them to the clearing. Pulling back a tree branch to reveal:
TRUTH
Santa's GROUNDED SLEIGH and nine grazing reindeer. Shocked awe.
MICHAEL
(can barely speak)
Cool...
Walter cannot yet deal with this reality. His eyes getting wider and wider...about to faint?
TV COVERAGE - CONTINUOUS
REMOTE REPORTER
Dick, according to authorities, the area has been cleared. Only the Central Park Rangers remain in the park.
EXT. BELVEDERE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS
TRACKING CLOSE UP OF HOOVES
All lined up along a ridge. FOUR BLACK MARES breathe steam into the night air. Their RIDERS are silently staring into the night. They wear black leather boots and trench coats.
Chrome helmets sit atop faces shrouded in shadow. A silver eagle badge reads CENTRAL PARK RANGERS. They look down upon the sleigh, quite a distance away.
REMOTE REPORTER (V.O.)
These forces are highly trained, but rarely see action. Some have accused them of being too ""gung ho"" when called into duty. And their crowd control tactics at the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85 were much criticized.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
JOVIE IS RUNNING down the street, heading into Central Park.
EXT. GREAT LAWN - CONTINUOUS
Buddy works on the engine while Walter and Michael try to wake up from this strange dream.
MICHAEL
So...you're...real?
SANTA
(re: sleigh; working)
Hold this for a sec.
WALTER
This is not happening.
Walter and Michael, stunned, hold the hood up.
MICHAEL
Buddy's really an Elf?
BUDDY
Actually, I'm adopted.
MICHAEL
I can't believe it.
SANTA
Tell me, what did you want for Christmas, Michael?
MICHAEL
I wanted a skateboard.
Santa pulls out a scroll. He points to his name in calligraphy on a THICK LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.
It's THE LIST.
SANTA
(verifying)
Not just a skateboard, a Real Huf Board with high 145 Thunder Trucks. 52 millimeter Spitfire Classic Wheels and bolts from Diamond and some Swiss Bearings.
In this moment, Walter and Michael both really believe.
ECU
We see the CLAUS-O-METER move up a little.
The sleigh SHUDDERS and RISES, then falls to the ground.
MICHAEL
What happened?
SANTA
Before our Viper engine days, this thing used to run solely on Christmas Spirit. You two believe in me. You made my sleigh fly.
MICHAEL
They fly away! Quick! Before they catch you!
SANTA
I wish I could. I'm afraid I need more than the Spirit of just you two.
MICHAEL
Hold it. If you're really Santa, we can just get the news cameras in here and everyone will believe in you, then your sleigh will fly, right?
SANTA
Christmas Spirit is about believing, not seeing. If the whole world saw me, all would be lost. The paparazzi have been after me for years.
Michael spots the RANGERS on the crest in the distance.
MICHAEL
Look!
They all look up in fear as the riders disappear into the woods. Buddy pulls Walter aside. Michael follows.
BUDDY
Santa needs your help.
MICHAEL
But, what can we do?
BUDDY
I got an idea.
He whispers a PLAN to Walter and Michael.

Michael SNATCHES the LIST from Santa and runs into the woods.
SANTA
My List!
Buddy stops Santa from chasing. He takes command.
BUDDY
Santa, let him go. You'll get it back. Now, listen to me. I need you to give Walter your hat and coat.
SANTA
But Mrs. Claus made them for me...
WALTER
Hurry! Do you have any idea what would happen to Santa Clause in prison?!
Santa complies and Walter dons the over-sized ensemble.

REMOTE REPORTER spots Michael running out of the trees.
REMOTE REPORTER
A young boy has just come running out of the park...Let me see if I can get a comment...
(to Michael)
Did you see anything?
MICHAEL
It's the real Santa! His sleigh can't fly cause nobody believes in him!
REMOTE REPORTER
(blowing him off)
Now, this is feeling more and more like some kind of elaborate Christmas hoax.
MICHAEL
This isn't a stunt. It's true! Everyone out there, Santa needs us to believe! I can prove he's real. This is Santa's LIST!
He pulls out the LIST and reads:
MICHAEL
Lynn Kessler wants a Powerpuff Girls play set! Mark Webber wants an electric guitar!
SERIES OF CUTS TO:
Lynn and Mark. Each with their eyes wide open, believing, giving Santa power.

I'm Charlotte Dennon.

Lemme see. Charlotte Dennon wants a ""Tiffany engagement ring, and for your boyfriend to stop dragging his feet and commit already!""
Off the Reporter's look, we...
SMASH CUT TO:
The SURGE IN CHRISTMAS SPIRIT makes Santa's Sleigh RISE A FOOT OFF THE GROUND. We see the gauge go forward a bit.
SANTA
We got power!
Santa snaps the reigns. The sleigh starts to lumber forward. Buddy still struggles with the engine under the sleigh.
BUDDY
I don't have the engine fixed yet!

The Anchorman is confused.
ANCHORMAN

EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
The Reporter stands staring at Michael as the lights are TURNED OFF on the remote unit.
MICHAEL
No!
REMOTE REPORTER
(stunned)
How did you know that?
MICHAEL
I'm telling you, it's Santa! We have to get the cameras back on! He needs our help!
This giant scene at the barricades has gone dark. The crowd offers scattered boos. Emily consoles Michael.
CROWD (O.S.)
Let the kid read! What do I want?!
The crowd stands around, confused. Jovie runs up to Michael and Emily, winded.
JOVIE
Where's Buddy?!
MICHAEL
He's with Santa. The sleigh won't fly. No one's believing! We need to get these cameras back on!
Jovie looks around. Trying to think of a plan. Inspired, she climbs atop a horse's carriage and looks out over the crowd. She's intimidated.
JOVIE
(to herself)
The best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear...
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Walter, standing watch, sees the MOUNTED POLICE CHARGING.
WALTER
Get out of here! They're coming! There's enough Christmas spirit to start moving!
Buddy jumps in. The sleigh slowly hovers forward a foot off the ground, in a herky-jerky way. The MOUNTED RIDERS come at Walter who wears Santa's hat and coat. He attempts to be a decoy.
WALTER
Hey! I'm right here! Ho ho ho! You got me! I surrender!
They ride right past him and after the sleigh.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy and Santa swerve past trees, scraping bark and smashing branches. Santa catches a glimpse over his shoulder of the Rangers in hot pursuit.
SANTA
Grab the shot gun under the seat and give 'em some heat!
BUDDY
What?!
SANTA
A joke, Buddy. Lighten up! Listen, there's barely enough magic to make this thing move. Keep working on the engine!
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
Above the huge crowd that has gathered at the barricade, we see Jovie standing on top of a car roof. Timidly, she begins singing, her sweet voice cracking with fear.
JOVIE
You better watch out, you better not cry, you better not pout. I'm telling you why...
Walter finally arrives. He joins his family, watching Jovie.
WALTER
(to Emily)
He wasn't lying.
EMILY
Merry Christmas.
They hug.
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS
Buddy, risking his life, working on the engine at high speed. Smoke and sparks billow out. Santa struggles to maintain control. They hit a bump and some toys fly out of the back.
A Jack in the Box rattles by Buddy, POPPING OPEN.
BUDDY
Ah!
They find themselves blocked by a giant FOUNTAIN with the Rangers close behind.
BUDDY
I've almost got it!
SANTA
We need power, now!
Buddy tweaks the engine. It HOWLS TO LIFE and the urge of power BLOWS THE SLEIGH FORTY FEET INTO THE AIR, clearing the fountain.
BUDDY
(in triumph)
YES!! I DID IT!! I'M THE GREATEST ADOPTED ELF IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD!
SANTA
Good job, Buddy!
But now the belly of the coach nails the winged statue atop the fountain, yanking the whole engine back out of the sleigh. YOINK! The machine whirls and shoots off the trees. The engineless sleigh crashes down to the bricks.
SANTA
That's it. With no engine, we're toast.

Emily is the first to join in. And now Michael sings too. And now some others...

Still with some Spirit power, the sleigh scrapes along the paved mall, sending sparks showering into the night air as the horses close in.

The WHOLE CROWD sings. The Remote Reporter sees this and puts her finger to her earpiece.
REMOTE REPORTER

Dick, come back to remote 3. I think I've got something here.
JOVIE & THE CROWD
He knows if you've been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake...
CAMERAS TURN BACK ON.
REMOTE TRUCK'S LIGHTS POP BACK ON. Again, the scene is aglow.
REMOTE REPORTER
(into cameras)
Charlotte Dennon, back at Central Park. Although we're still unclear about what led to this holiday rally, hundreds of New Yorkers have spontaneously gathered together and broken out into song. A curious Christmas Eve, to say the least. Let's listen in...
BRIEF CUTS AROUND THE CITY
The Broadcast is being watched...
- We see the MAILROOM guys in A bar singing along in perfect harmony.
- the THREE WRITERS are singing.
- the DOCTOR is singing.
- the GUARDS from the Empire State Building are singing.
- the TEENAGERS who threw snowballs sing.
- the ELF MANAGER from Gimbels sings with co-workers.
ELF MANAGER
(as his friends sing)
Do what you want, I ain't singing a damn thing.
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Santa's sleigh is being rail-roaded. Right into the barricades. No steering, no lift...up in the distance, we see they are headed for a collision.
EXT. BARRICADE - CONTINUOUS
As Emily and Michael sing along, Michael looks up at Walter and notices something peculiar. He busts his father.
MICHAEL
Wait! You're NOT singing!
WALTER
Yes I am.
MICHAEL
No you're not. You're just moving your lips.
WALTER
Michael! Please, I have a terrible voice.
MICHAEL
Dad!!!
Then, in spite of himself, WALTER BELTS OUT THE CHORUS in such an awful voice, it draws looks from the singers around him. As the bad notes rise into the chilly night air...
WALTER
(terrible)
Santa Claus is coming to town!
EXT. THE MOVING SLEIGH - CONTINUOUS
Walter's singing somehow does the trick. The CLAUS-O-METER shoots to the MAX!
A dash light BLINKS ""HO HO HO"" as the gauge hits the red zone. Santa howls in approval. The SLEIGH flies up into the night air and over the barricade, reporters and on-lookers. The rangers slide to a stop, foiled at last.
As the shadow of the sleigh zips high over them, the whole crowd joins in, singing their hearts out. Jovie can't believe it. She sings even stronger.
A VOICE BOOMS OUT from a mysterious silhouette into the magical winter night...
SANTA
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!
Santa's sleigh whips down Sixth Ave. and into the Manhattan night sky. And silhouettes against the moon.

PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And so, with a little help, Buddy managed to save Christmas.
INT. HOBBS' APARTMENT - CHRISTMAS DAY
Walter, Michael, Buddy, Emily and Jovie sit happily gathered around their Christmas tree. Wrapping paper everywhere.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And his spirit saved a lot of other people, too. It was quite a Christmas, and quite a New Year.
INT. WALTER'S NEW COMPANY - DAY
Walter is stenciling the name 'HOBB'S PUBLISHING'.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter started his own independent publishing company. His first book was written by a brand new critically acclaimed children's author...
INT. GIMBELS - DAY
The 'ELF' book from the beginning of the movie is Buddy's. He's doing a book signing. The place is packed.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
The book was called 'Elf'. A fictional story about an adopted Elf named Buddy who was raised in the North Pole. Went to New York, ate spaghetti, worked in a shiny mail room and eventually saved Christmas.
Buddy and Walter ice skate together at Rockefeller Center in the middle of the night.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
And every year, on Christmas day, after all the presents are opened by children around the world, Buddy and his Dad make up for lost time...
Buddy still tries to hold his hand. Walter slaps it away.

We see an Elfish hand applying white out to Walter's name on the List.
PAPA ELF (V.O.)
Walter even made the jump from 'naughty' to 'nice'.

INT. PAPA ELF'S WORKSHOP - DAY
Jovie, in real Elf clothes, sets a pitcher of milk in front of Papa Elf. She sits beside Buddy who cradles a NEWBORN BABY in his arms wearing a pink Elf hat that says SUSIE.
This is the last image of the movie and also the last image of the book. It freezes and now becomes a drawing and we pull out to see it's the last page of Buddy's ELF book, which magically flips closed.
We're back in the bookstore from the very first scene. A little kid grabs the book out of the window.

633,My Dad,"*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
""Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!""
Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?

634,She'll Never Know,"(Verse1)
She was from the other side of town
A place where skin like mine just ain't around
A place of unwritten laws and ancient ways where no one dares to stray
But as our destiny's were laughin, some how we came to be close friends
And now I'm haunted by this crazy secret that's got me cryin till the end

[Chorus:]
How much I wanted, How I needed to let my feelings show
How much my heart overflowed, she'll never know
How much I loved her, I couldn't hurt her
So I had to let her go
How much it tortures my soul, she'll never know

(Verse2)
Everytime she looked into my eyes
I knew that all she wanted was a sign
Ohh, but that was the one thing I couldn't do cause of all the hell they'd put her through
They would cast her aside forever and I could never watch her be disowned
There's just no way I won't put her through it and that's why she'll never know

[Chorus:]
It hurt so bad to be denied a reason
There is no reason
It was too much to keep inside all I could say was good-bye

635,I'm A Woman,"[Verse 1]
I can see you're disappointed
By the way you look at me
And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

[Verse 2]
Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 3]
So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

[Bridge]
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

[Verse 4]
Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation

[Verse 5]
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

[Verse 6]
Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

I thought you didn't care at all
I was sad as I could be
The same boy who's fella to me
But oh how I tried to resist him, oh how I tried to resist him
But my heart told me to keep him, my heart told me to keep him

It's strange, I know, but that's the way it goes
Leaving you this way, I'm sorry to say
When you get home, I'll be gone
Asked my papa for your letter that I put aside
When you finish the letter, I'll be Eddie's bride

Let me be by myself in the evenin' breeze
And listen to the murmur of the tall concrete
Send me off forever but I ask you, please

643,I'm Gonna' Be Warm This Winter,"[Intro]
We met at a ski lodge
And we fell in love

[Verse 1]
Right by a fireplace
We shared our first embrace
And then inside my heart
I felt a fire start

[Chorus]
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm this winter

[Verse 2]
Each time your lips touch mine
They taste like sparkling wine
I feel so warm and loved
Just cause I love you so

[Chorus]
It's cozy in your arms
I'm yours to have and to hold
And I'm gonna be warm this winter

[Bridge]
Ice skating on a frozen lake
Sleigh riding down a mountainside
Roasting popcorn, dancing till the dawn
That was how a new love was born
It's just like make believe
Each night is New Year's Eve
Each day is Christmas day
You make me feel this way

[Chorus]
It's gonna snow outside
The weather will be cold
But I'm gonna be warm this winter

644,Proud,"[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so  proud of you

Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha

I’m a star: sheriff badge

Ktoś wozi zimę, a noce zamieniają wino w winę tu
Płonie kalumet jakby siedział z nami Winnetou
Mógłbym się oprzeć gdyby nie te parę sztyletów
Na samym końcu puszczę z dymem loop
Myśli jak pętla oblepione brudem
Ciągle podrzucają zwłoki, jak nad ranem Uber
W ciszy konstruuję burze, oświetlają mi pioruny tunel
Niczym te twarze ekrany komórek
To atol Bikini na sekundy przed wybuchem
Na metkach WySyRyHy, w ID jakbym miał Duke Nukem
Noszę wytrychy, bo wciąż słowa klucze gubię
Chcesz mnie rozkminić, choć samemu siebie kumam z trudem?
Piszę to tłustym drukiem, a patrzą pustym wzrokiem
I w sumie chuj z tym, ok? Bo gra to tu z tych okien
Zdmuchuję kurz z tych pociech znów
A one w nocy błyszczą w puszczy pod blokiem

Życie się bawi z nami jak pierwszego kwietnia

Obok sześcianu sześcian i czyjeś oczy we łzach
Ściera się Air-Max, nie cofam się jak Rijkaard
I nie wypadam z torów, mimo że jadę jak Senna
Wiara się martwi czy ma czyste buty, a nie serca
Tu trasy toną we mgłach, a noce w bębnach
Gram jak ta zdrata płyta, niczym Evidence i Madchild
Kurwa jaki zostawisz komentarz
Przemierzam wszechświat, po nitce do kłębka
Gdzie system wciąż wnerwia, gdzie coś zniknie w bletkach
I się nie lękam, mimo że zamiast dłoni mają ostrza niczym Edward
Co trafiają pod żebra

656,Shake Me I Rattle (Squeeze Me I Cry),"THE ANCIENT OVERLOADED Hudson creaked and grunted to the highway at
Sallisaw and turned west, and the sun was blinding. But on the concrete road Al built
up his speed because the flattened springs were not in danger any more. From Sallisaw
to Gore is twenty-one miles and the Hudson was doing thirty-five miles an hour. From
Gore to Warner thirteen miles; Warner to Checotah fourteen miles; Checotah a long
jump to Henrietta—thirty-four miles, but a real town at the end of it. Henrietta to
Castle, nineteen miles, and the sun was overhead, and the red fields, heated by the high
sun, vibrated the air.
Al, at the wheel, his face purposeful, his whole body listening to the car, his restless
eyes jumping from the road to the instrument panel. Al was one with his engine, every
nerve listening for weaknesses, for the thumps or squeals, hums and chattering that
indicate a change that may cause a breakdown. He had become the soul of the car.
Granma, beside him on the seat, half slept, and whimpered in her sleep, opened her
eyes to peer ahead, and then dozed again. And Ma sat beside Granma, one elbow out
the window, and the skin reddening under the fierce sun. Ma looked ahead too, but her
eyes were flat and did not see the road or the fields, the gas stations, the little eating
sheds. She did not glance at them as the Hudson went by.
Al shifted himself on the broken seat and changed his grip on the steering wheel.
And he sighed, ""Makes a racket, but I think she's awright. God knows what she'll do if
we got to climb a hill with the load we got. Got any hills 'tween here an' California,
Ma?""
Ma turned her head slowly and her eyes came to life.
""Seems to me they's hills,"" she said. ""'Course I dunno. But seems to me I heard
they's hills an' even mountains. Big ones.""
Granma drew a long whining sigh in her sleep.
Al said, ""We'll burn right up if we got climbin' to do. Have to throw out some a' this
stuff. Maybe, we shouldn' a brang that preacher.""
""You'll be glad a that preacher 'fore we're through,"" said Ma. ""That preacher'll help
us."" She looked ahead at the gleaming road again.
Al steered with one hand and put the other on the vibrating gear-shift lever. He had
difficulty in speaking. His mouth formed the words silently before he said them aloud.
""Ma—"" She looked slowly around at him, her head swaying a little with the car's
motion. ""Ma, you scared a goin'? You scared a goin' to a new place?""
Her eyes grew thoughtful and soft. ""A little,"" she said. ""Only it ain't like scared so
much. I'm jus' a settin' here waitin'. When somepin happens that I got to do somepin—
I'll do it.""
""Ain't you thinkin' what's it gonna be like when we get there? Ain't you scared it
won't be nice like we thought?""
""No,"" she said quickly. ""No, I ain't. You can't do that. I can't do that. It's too
much—livin' too many lives. Up ahead they's a thousan' lives we might live, but when
it comes, it'll on'y be one. If I go ahead on all of 'em, it's too much. You got to live
ahead 'cause you're so young, but—it's jus' the road goin' by for me. An' it's jus' how
soon they gonna wanta eat some more pork bones."" Her face tightened. ""That's all I
can do. I can't do no more. All the rest'd get upset if I done any more'n that. They all
depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.""
Granma yawned shrilly and opened her eyes. She looked wildly about. ""I got to get
out, praise Gawd,"" she said.
""First clump a brush,"" said Al. ""They's one up ahead.""
""Brush or no brush, I got to git out, I tell ya."" And she began to whine, ""I got to git
out. I got to git out.""
Al speeded up, and when he came to the low brush he pulled up short. Ma threw the
door open and half pulled the struggling old lady out beside the road and into the
bushes. And Ma held her so Granma would not fall when she squatted.
On top of the truck the others stirred to life. Their faces were shining with sunburn
they could not escape. Tom and Casy and Noah and Uncle John let themselves wearily
down. Ruthie and Winfield swarmed down the side-boards and went off into the
bushes. Connie helped Rose of Sharon gently down. Under the canvas, Grampa was
awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless.
He watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching.
Tom called to him, ""Want to come down, Grampa?""
The old eyes turned listlessly to him. ""No,"" said Grampa. For a moment the
fierceness came into his eyes. ""I ain't a-goin', I tell you. Gonna stay like Muley."" And
then he lost interest again. Ma came back, helping Granma up the bank to the highway.
""Tom,"" she said. ""Get that pan a bones, under the canvas in back. We got to eat
somepin."" Tom got the pan and passed it around, and the family stood by the roadside,
gnawing the crisp particles from the pork bones.
""Sure lucky we brang these along,"" said Pa. ""Git so stiff up there can't hardly move.
Where's the water?""
""Ain't it up with you?"" Ma asked. ""I set out that gallon jug.""
Pa climbed the sides and looked under the canvas. ""It ain't here. We must a forgot
it.""
Thirst set in instantly. Winfield moaned, ""I wanta drink. I wanta drink."" The men
licked their lips, suddenly conscious of their thirst. And a little panic started.
Al felt the fear growing. ""We'll get water first service station we come to. We need
some gas too."" The family swarmed up the truck sides; Ma helped Granma in and got
in beside her. Al started the motor and they moved on.
Castle to Paden twenty-five miles and the sun passed the zenith and started down.
And the radiator cap began to jiggle up and down and steam started to whish out. Near
Paden there was a shack beside the road and two gas pumps in front of it; and beside a
fence, a water faucet and a hose. Al drove in and nosed the Hudson up to the hose. As
they pulled in, a stout man, red of face and arms, got up from a chair behind the gas
pumps and moved toward them. He wore brown corduroys, and suspenders and a polo
shirt; and he had a cardboard sun helmet, painted silver, on his head. The sweat beaded
on his nose and under his eyes and formed streams in the wrinkles of his neck. He
strolled toward the truck, looking truculent and stern.
""You folks aim to buy anything? Gasoline or stuff?"" he asked.
Al was out already, unscrewing the steaming radiator cap with the tips of his
fingers, jerking his hand away to escape the spurt when the cap should come loose.
""Need some gas, mister.""
""Got any money?""
""Sure. Think we're beggin'?""
The truculence left the fat man's face. ""Well, that's all right, folks. He'p yourself to
water."" And he hastened to explain. ""Road is full a people, come in, use water, dirty up
the toilet, an' then, by God, they'll steal stuff an' don't buy nothin'. Got no money to
buy with. Come beggin' a gallon gas to move on.""
Tom dropped angrily to the ground and moved toward the fat man. ""We're payin'
our way,"" he said fiercely. ""You got no call to give us a goin'-over. We ain't asked you
for nothin'.""
""I ain't,"" the fat man said quickly. The sweat began to soak through his shortsleeved polo shirt. ""Jus' he'p yourself to water, and go use the toilet if you want.""
Winfield had got the hose. He drank from the end and then turned the stream over
his head and face and emerged dripping. ""It ain't cool,"" he said.
""I don't know what the country's comin' to,"" the fat man continued. His complaint
had shifted now and he was no longer talking to or about the Joads. ""Fifty-sixty cars a
folks go by ever' day, folks all movin' west with kids an' househol' stuff. Where they
goin'? What they gonna do?""
""Doin' the same as us,"" said Tom. ""Goin' someplace to live. Tryin' to get along.
That's all.""
""Well, I don' know what the country's comin' to. I jus' don' know. Here's me tryin' to
get along, too. Think any them big new cars stop here? No, sir! They go on to them
yella-painted company stations in town. They don't stop no place like this. Most folks
stops here ain't got nothin.""
Al flipped the radiator cap and it jumped into the air with a head of steam behind it,
and a hollow bubbling sound came out of the radiator. On top of the truck, the
suffering hound dog crawled timidly to the edge of the load and looked over,
whimpering, toward the water. Uncle John climbed up and lifted him down by the
scruff of the neck. For a moment the dog staggered on stiff legs, and then he went to
lap the mud under the faucet. In the highway the cars whizzed by, glistening in the
heat, and the hot wind of their going fanned into the service-station yard. Al filled the
radiator with the hose.
""It ain't that I'm tryin' to git trade outa rich folks,"" the fat man went on. ""I'm jus'
tryin' to git trade. Why, the folks that stops here begs gasoline an' they trades for
gasoline. I could show you in my back room the stuff they'll trade for gas an' oil: beds
an' baby buggies an' pots an' pans. One family traded a doll their kid had for a gallon.
An' what'm I gonna do with the stuff, open a junk shop? Why, one fella wanted to
gimme his shoes for a gallon. An' if I was that kinda fella I bet I could git—"" He
glanced at Ma and stopped.
Jim Casy had wet his head, and the drops still coursed down his high forehead, and
his muscled neck was wet, and his shirt was wet. He moved over beside Tom. ""It ain't
the people's fault,"" he said. ""How'd you like to sell the bed you sleep on for a tankful a
gas?""
""I know it ain't their fault. Ever' person I talked to is on the move for a damn good
reason. But what's the country comin' to? That's what I wanta know. What's it comin'
to? Fella can't make a livin' no more. Folks can't make a livin' farmin'. I ask you, what's
it comin' to? I can't figure her out. Ever'body I ask, they can't figure her out. Fella
wants to trade his shoes so he can git a hunderd miles on. I can't figure her out."" He
took off his silver hat and wiped his forehead with his palm. And Tom took off his cap
and wiped his forehead with it. He went to the hose and wet the cap through and
squeezed it and put it on again. Ma worked a tin cup out through the side bars of the
truck, and she took water to Granma and to Grampa on top of the load. She stood on
the bars and handed the cup to Grampa, and he wet his lips, and then shook his head
and refused more. The old eyes looked up at Ma in pain and bewilderment for a
moment before the awareness receded again.
Al started the motor and backed the truck to the gas pump. ""Fill her up. She'll take
about seven,"" said Al. ""We'll give her six so she don't spill none.""
The fat man put the hose in the tank. ""No, sir,"" he said. ""I jus' don't know what the
country's comin' to. Relief an' all.""
Casy said, ""I been walkin' aroun' in the country. Ever'body's askin' that. What we
comin' to? Seems to me we don't never come to nothin'. Always on the way. Always
goin' and goin'. Why don't folks think about that? They's movement now. People
moving. We know why, an' we know how. Movin' 'cause they got to. That's why folks
always move. Movin' 'cause they want somepin better'n what they got. An' that's the
on'y way they'll ever git it. Wantin' it an' needin' it, they'll go out an' git it. It's bein'
hurt that makes folks mad to fightin'. I been walkin' aroun' the country, an' hearin' folks
talk like you.""
The fat man pumped the gasoline and the needle turned on the pump dial, recording
the amount. ""Yeah, but what's it comin' to? That's what I want ta know.""
Tom broke in irritably, ""Well, you ain't never gonna know. Casy tries to tell ya an'
you jest ast the same thing over. I seen fellas like you before. You ain't askin' nothin';
you're jus' singin' a kinda song. 'What we comin' to?' You don' wanta know. Country's
movin' aroun', goin' places. They's folks dyin' all aroun'. Maybe you'll die pretty soon,
but you won't know nothin'. I seen too many fellas like you. You don't want to know
nothin'. Just sing yourself to sleep with a song—'What we comin' to?'"" He looked at
the gas pump, rusted and old, and at the shack behind it, built of old lumber, the nail
holes of its first use still showing through the paint that had been brave, the brave
yellow paint that had tried to imitate the big company stations in town. But the paint
couldn't cover the old nail holes and the old cracks in the lumber, and the paint could
not be renewed. The imitation was a failure and the owner had known it was a failure.
And inside the open door of the shack Tom saw the oil barrels, only two of them, and
the candy counter with stale candies and licorice whips turning brown with age, and
cigarettes. He saw the broken chair and the fly screen with a rusted hole in it. And the
littered yard that should have been graveled, and behind, the corn field drying and
dying in the sun. Beside the house the little stock of used tires and retreaded tires. And
he saw for the first time the fat man's cheap washed pants and his cheap polo shirt and
his paper hat. He said, ""I didn' mean to sound off at ya, mister. It's the heat. You ain't
got nothin'. Pretty soon you'll be on the road yourse'f. And it ain't tractors'll put you
there. It's them pretty yella stations in town. Folks is movin',"" he said ashamedly. ""An'
you'll be movin', mister.""
The fat man's hand slowed on the pump and stopped while Tom spoke. He looked
worriedly at Tom. ""How'd you know?"" he asked helplessly. ""How'd you know we was
already talkin' about packin' up an' movin' west?""
Casy answered him. ""It's ever'body,"" he said. ""Here's me that used to give all my
fight against the devil 'cause I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they's somepin
worse'n the devil got hold a the country, an' it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.
Ever see one a them Gila monsters take hold, mister? Grabs hold, an' you chop him in
two an' his head hangs on. Chop him at the neck an' his head hangs on. Got to take a
screw-driver an' pry his head apart to git him loose. An' while he's layin' there, poison
is drippin' an' drippin' into the hole he's made with his teeth."" He stopped and looked
sideways at Tom.
The fat man stared hopelessly straight ahead. His hand started turning the crank
slowly. ""I dunno what we're comin' to,"" he said softly.
Over by the water hose, Connie and Rose of Sharon stood together, talking secretly.
Connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup
again. Rose of Sharon watched the cars go by on the highway. Connie held out the cup
to her. ""This water ain't cool, but it's wet,"" he said.
She looked at him and smiled secretly. She was all secrets now she was pregnant,
secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. She was pleased with herself,
and she complained about things that didn't really matter. And she demanded services
of Connie that were silly, and both of them knew they were silly. Connie was pleased
with her too, and filled with wonder that she was pregnant. He liked to think he was in
on the secrets she had. When she smiled slyly, he smiled slyly too, and they exchanged
confidences in whispers. The world had drawn close around them, and they were in the
center of it, or rather Rose of Sharon was in the center of it with Connie making a
small orbit about her. Everything they said was a kind of secret.
She drew her eyes from the highway. ""I ain't very thirsty,"" she said daintily. ""But
maybe I ought to drink.""
And he nodded, for he knew well what she meant. She took the cup and rinsed her
mouth and spat and then drank the cupful of tepid water. ""Want another?"" he asked.
""Jus' a half."" And so he filled the cup just half, and gave it to her. A Lincoln Zephyr,
silvery and low, whisked by. She turned to see where the others were and saw them
clustered about the truck. Reassured, she said, ""How'd you like to be goin' along in
that?""
Connie sighed, ""Maybe—after."" They both knew what he meant. ""An' if they's
plenty work in California, we'll git our own car. But them""—he indicated the
disappearing Zephyr—""them kind costs as much as a good size house. I ruther have the
house.""
""I like to have the house an' one a them,"" she said. ""But 'course the house would be
first because—"" And they both knew what she meant. They were terribly excited about
the pregnancy.
""You feel awright?"" he asked.
""Tar'd. Jus' tar'd ridin' in the sun.""
""We got to do that or we won't never get to California.""
""I know,"" she said.
The dog wandered, sniffing, past the truck, trotted to the puddle under the hose
again and lapped at the muddy water. And then he moved away, nose down and ears
hanging. He sniffed his way among the dusty weeds beside the road, to the edge of the
pavement. He raised his head and looked across, and then started over. Rose of Sharon
screamed shrilly. A big swift car whisked near, tires squealed. The dog dodged
helplessly, and with a shriek, cut off in the middle, went under the wheels. The big car
slowed for a moment and faces looked back, and then it gathered greater speed and
disappeared. And the dog, a blot of blood and tangled, burst intestines, kicked slowly
in the road.
Rose of Sharon's eyes were wide. ""D'you think it'll hurt?"" she begged. ""Think it'll
hurt?""
Connie put his arm around her. ""Come set down,"" he said. ""It wasn't nothin'.""
""But I felt it hurt. I felt it kinda jar when I yelled.""
""Come set down. It wasn't nothin'. It won't hurt."" He led her to the side of the truck
away from the dying dog and sat her down on the running board.
Tom and Uncle John walked out to the mess. The last quiver was going out of the
crushed body. Tom took it by the legs and dragged it to the side of the road. Uncle
John looked embarrassed, as though it were his fault. ""I ought ta tied him up,"" he said.
Pa looked down at the dog for a moment and then he turned away. ""Le's get outa
here,"" he said. ""I don' know how we was gonna feed 'im anyways. Just as well,
maybe.""
The fat man came from behind the truck. ""I'm sorry, folks,"" he said. ""A dog jus' don'
last no time near a highway. I had three dogs run over in a year. Don't keep none, no
more."" And he said, ""Don't you folks worry none about it. I'll take care of 'im. Bury 'im
out in the corn field.""
Ma walked over to Rose of Sharon, where she sat, still shuddering, on the running
board. ""You all right, Rosasharn?"" she asked. ""You feelin' poorly?""
""I seen that. Give me a start.""
""I heard ya yip,"" said Ma. ""Git yourself laced up, now.""
""You suppose it might of hurt?""
""No,"" said Ma. "" 'F you go to greasin' yourself an' feelin' sorry, an' tuckin' yourself
in a swalla's nest, it might. Rise up now, an' he'p me get Granma comf'table. Forget
that baby for a minute. He'll take care a hisself.""
""Where is Granma?"" Rose of Sharon asked.
""I dunno. She's aroun' here somewheres. Maybe in the outhouse.""
The girl went toward the toilet, and in a moment she came out, helping Granma
along. ""She went to sleep in there,"" said Rose of Sharon.
Granma grinned. ""It's nice in there,"" she said. ""They got a patent toilet in there an'
the water comes down. I like it in there,"" she said contentedly. ""Would of took a good
nap if I wasn't woke up.""
""It ain't a nice place to sleep,"" said Rose of Sharon, and she helped Granma into the
car. Granma settled herself happily. ""Maybe it ain't nice for purty, but it's nice for
nice,"" she said.
Tom said, ""Le's go. We got to make miles.""
Pa whistled shrilly. ""Now where'd them kids go?"" He whistled again, putting his
fingers in his mouth.
In a moment they broke from the corn field, Ruthie ahead and Winfield trailing her.
""Eggs!"" Ruthie cried. ""Look!"" A dozen soft, grayish-white eggs were in her grubby
hand. And as she held up her hand, her eyes fell upon the dead dog beside the road.
""Oh!"" she said. Ruthie and Winfield walked slowly toward the dog. They inspected
him.
Pa called to them, ""Come on, you, 'less you want to git left.""
They turned solemnly and walked to the truck. Ruthie looked once more at the gray
reptile eggs in her hand, and then she threw them away. They climbed up the side of
the truck. ""His eyes was still open,"" said Ruthie in a hushed tone.
But Winfield gloried in the scene. He said boldly, ""His guts was just strowed all
over—all over""—he was silent for a moment—""strowed—all—over,"" he said, and then
he rolled over quickly and vomited down the side of the truck. When he sat up again
his eyes were watery and his nose running. ""It ain't like killin' pigs,"" he said in
explanation.
Al had the hood of the Hudson up, and he checked the oil level. He brought a gallon
can from the floor of the front seat and poured a quantity of cheap black oil into the
pipe and checked the level again.
Tom came beside him. ""Want I should take her a piece?"" he asked.
""I ain't tired,"" said Al.
""Well, you didn't get no sleep las' night. I took a snooze this morning. Get up there
on top. I'll take her.""
""Awright,"" Al said reluctantly. ""But watch the oil gauge pretty close. Take her slow.
An' I been watchin' for a short. Take a look a the needle now an' then. 'F she jumps to
discharge it's a short. An' take her slow, Tom. She's overloaded.""
Tom laughed. ""I'll watch her,"" he said. ""You can res' easy.""
The family piled on top of the truck again. Ma settled herself beside Granma in the
seat, and Tom took his place and started the motor. ""Sure is loose,"" he said, and he put
it in gear and pulled away down the highway.
The motor droned along steadily and the sun receded down the sky in front of them.
Granma slept steadily, and even Ma dropped her head forward and dozed. Tom pulled
his cap over his eyes to shut out the blinding sun.
Paden to Meeker is thirteen miles; Meeker to Harrah is fourteen miles; and then
Oklahoma City—the big city. Tom drove straight on. Ma waked up and looked at the
streets as they went through the city. And the family, on top of the truck, stared about
at the stores, at the big houses, at the office buildings. And then the buildings grew
smaller and the stores smaller. The wrecking yards and hot-dog stands, the out-city
dance halls.
Ruthie and Winfield saw it all, and it embarrassed them with its bigness and its
strangeness, and it frightened them with the fine-clothed people they saw. They did not
speak of it to each other. Later—they would, but not now. They saw the oil derricks in
the town, on the edge of the town; oil derricks black, and the smell of oil and gas in the
air. But they didn't exclaim. It was so big and so strange it frightened them.
In the street Rose of Sharon saw a man in a light suit. He wore white shoes and a
flat straw hat. She touched Connie and indicated the man with her eyes, and then
Connie and Rose of Sharon giggled softly to themselves, and the giggles got the best of
them. They covered their mouths. And it felt so good that they looked for other people
to giggle at. Ruthie and Winfield saw them giggling and it looked such fun that they
tried to do it too—but they couldn't. The giggles wouldn't come. But Connie and Rose
of Sharon were breathless and red with stifling laughter before they could stop. It got
so bad that they had only to look at each other to start over again.
The outskirts were wide spread. Tom drove slowly and carefully in the traffic, and
then they were on 66—the great western road, and the sun was sinking on the line of
the road. The windshield was bright with dust. Tom pulled his cap lower over his eyes,
so low that he had to tilt his head back to see out at all. Granma slept on, the sun on her
closed eyelids, and the veins on her temples were blue, and the little bright veins on her
cheeks were wine-colored, and the old brown marks on her face turned darker.
Tom said, ""We stay on this road right straight through.""
Ma had been silent for a long time. ""Maybe we better fin' a place to stop 'fore
sunset,"" she said. ""I got to get some pork a-boilin' an' some bread made. That takes
time.""
""Sure,"" Tom agreed. ""We ain't gonna make this trip in one jump. Might's well
stretch ourselves.""
Oklahoma City to Bethany is fourteen miles.
Tom said, ""I think we better stop 'fore the sun goes down. Al got to build that thing
on the top. Sun'll kill the folks up there.""
Ma had been dozing again. Her head jerked upright. ""Got to get some supper acookin',"" she said. And she said, ""Tom, your pa tol' me about you crossin' the State
line-""
He was a long time answering. ""Yeah? What about it, Ma?""
""Well, I'm scairt about it. It'll make you kinda runnin' away. Maybe they'll catch
ya.""
Tom held his hand over his eyes to protect himself from the lowering sun. ""Don't
you worry,"" he said. ""I figgered her out. They's lots a fellas out on parole an' they's
more goin' in all the time. If I get caught for anything else out west, well, then they got
my pitcher an' my prints in Washington. They'll sen' me back. But if I don't do no
crimes, they won't give a damn.""
""Well, I'm a-scairt about it. Sometimes you do a crime, an' you don't even know it's
bad. Maybe they got crimes in California we don't even know about. Maybe you gonna
do somepin an' it's all right, an' in California it ain't all right.""
""Be jus' the same if I wasn't on parole,"" he said. ""On'y if I get caught I get a bigger
jolt'n other folks. Now you quit a-worryin',"" he said. ""We got plenty to worry about
'thout you figgerin' out things to worry about.""
""I can't he'p it,"" she said. ""Minute you cross the line you done a crime.""
""Well, that's better'n stickin' aroun' Sallisaw an' starvin' to death,"" he said. ""We
better look out for a place to stop.""
They went through Bethany and out on the other side. In a ditch, where a culvert
went under the road, an old touring car was pulled off the highway and a little tent was
pitched beside it, and smoke came out of a stove pipe through the tent. Tom pointed
ahead. ""There's some folks campin'. Looks like as good a place as we seen."" He slowed
his motor and pulled to a stop beside the road. The hood of the old touring car was up,
and a middle-aged man stood looking down at the motor. He wore a cheap straw
sombrero, a blue shirt, and a black, spotted vest, and his jeans were stiff and shiny with
dirt. His face was lean, the deep cheek-lines great furrows down his face so that his
cheek bones and chin stood out sharply. He looked up at the Joad truck and his eyes
were puzzled and angry.
Tom leaned out of the window. ""Any law 'gainst folks stoppin' here for the night?""
The man had seen only the truck. His eyes focused down on Tom. ""I dunno,"" he
said. ""We on'y stopped here 'cause we couldn't git no further.""
""Any water here?""
The man pointed to a service-station shack about a quarter of a mile ahead. ""They's
water there they'll let ya take a bucket of.""
Tom hesitated. ""Well, ya s'pose we could camp down 'longside?""
The lean man looked puzzled. ""We don't own it,"" he said. ""We on'y stopped here
'cause this goddamn ol' trap wouldn' go no further.""
Tom insisted. ""Anyways you're here an' we ain't. You got a right to say if you wan'
neighbors or not.""
The appeal to hospitality had an instant effect. The lean face broke into a smile.
""Why, sure, come on off the road. Proud to have ya."" And he called, ""Sairy, there's
some folks goin' ta stay with us. Come on out an' say how d'ya do. Sairy ain't well,"" he
added. The tent flaps opened and a wizened woman came out—a face wrinkled as a
dried leaf and eyes that seemed to flame in her face, black eyes that seemed to look out
of a well of horror. She was small and shuddering. She held herself upright by a tent
flap, and the hand holding onto the canvas was a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin.
When she spoke her voice had a beautiful low timbre, soft and modulated, and yet
with ringing overtones. ""Tell 'em welcome,"" she said. ""Tell 'em good an' welcome.""
Tom drove off the road and brought his truck into the field and lined it up with the
touring car. And people boiled down from the truck; Ruthie and Winfield too quickly,
so that their legs gave way and they shrieked at the pins and needles that ran through
their limbs. Ma went quickly to work. She untied the three-gallon bucket from the back
of the truck and approached the squealing children. ""Now you go git water—right
down there. Ask nice. Say, 'Please, kin we git a bucket a water?' and say, 'Thank you.'
An' carry it back together helpin', an' don't spill none. An' if you see stick wood to
burn, bring it on."" The children stamped away toward the shack.
By the tent a little embarrassment had set in, and social intercourse had paused
before it started. Pa said, ""You ain't Oklahomy folks?""
And Al, who stood near the car, looked at the license plates. ""Kansas,"" he said.
The lean man said, ""Galena, or right about there. Wilson, Ivy Wilson.""
""We're Joads,"" said Pa. ""We come from right near Sallisaw.""
""Well, we're proud to meet you folks,"" said Ivy Wilson. ""Sairy, these is Joads.""
""I knowed you wasn't Oklahomy folks. You talk queer kinda—that ain't no blame,
you understan'.""
""Ever'body says words different,"" said Ivy. ""Arkansas folks says 'em different, and
Oklahomy folks says 'em different. And we seen a lady from Massachusetts, an' she
said 'em differentest of all. Couldn' hardly make out what she was sayin'.""
Noah and Uncle John and the preacher began to unload the truck. They helped
Grampa down and sat him on the ground and he sat limply, staring ahead of him. ""You
sick, Grampa?"" Noah asked.
""You goddamn right,"" said Grampa weakly. ""Sicker'n hell.""
Sairy Wilson walked slowly and carefully toward him. ""How'd you like ta come in
our tent?"" she asked. ""You kin lay down on our mattress an' rest.""
He looked up at her, drawn by her soft voice. ""Come on now,"" she said. ""You'll git
some rest. We'll he'p you over.""
Without warning Grampa began to cry. His chin wavered and his old lips tightened
over his mouth and he sobbed hoarsely. Ma rushed over to him and put her arms
around him. She lifted him to his feet, her broad back straining, and she half lifted, half
helped him into the tent.
Uncle John said, ""He must be good an' sick. He ain't never done that before. Never
seen him blubberin' in my life."" He jumped up on the truck and tossed a mattress
down.
Ma came out of the tent and went to Casy. ""You been aroun' sick people,"" she said.
""Grampa's sick. Won't you go take a look at him?""
Casy walked quickly to the tent and went inside. A double mattress was on the
ground, the blankets spread neatly; and a little tin stove stood on iron legs, and the fire
in it burned unevenly. A bucket of water, a wooden box of supplies, and a box for a
table, that was all. The light of the setting sun came pinkly through the tent walls. Sairy
Wilson knelt on the ground, beside the mattress, and Grampa lay on his back. His eyes
were open, staring upward, and his cheeks were flushed. He breathed heavily.
Casy took the skinny old wrist in his fingers. ""Feeling kinda tired, Grampa?"" he
asked. The staring eyes moved toward his voice but did not find him. The lips
practiced a speech but did not speak it. Casy felt the pulse and he dropped the wrist and
put his hand on Grampa's forehead. A struggle began in the old man's body, his legs
moved restlessly and his hands stirred. He said a whole string of blurred sounds that
were not words, and his face was red under the spiky white whiskers.
Sairy Wilson spoke softly to Casy. ""Know what's wrong?""
He looked up at the wrinkled face and the burning eyes. ""Do you?""
""I—think so.""
""What?"" Casy asked.
""Might be wrong. I wouldn' like to say.""
Casy looked back at the twitching red face. ""Would you say—maybe—he's workin'
up a stroke?""
""I'd say that,"" said Sairy. ""I seen it three times before.""
From outside came the sounds of camp-making, wood chopping, and the rattle of
pans. Ma looked through the flaps. ""Granma wants to come in. Would she better?""
The preacher said, ""She'll just fret if she don't.""
""Think he's awright?"" Ma asked.
Casy shook his head slowly. Ma looked quickly down at the struggling old face
with blood pounding through it. She drew outside and her voice came through. ""He's
awright, Granma. He's jus' takin' a little res'.""
And Granma answered sulkily, ""Well, I want ta see him. He's a tricky devil. He
wouldn't never let ya know."" And she came scurrying through the flaps. She stood over
the mattresses and looked down. ""What's the matter'th you?"" she demanded of Grampa.
And again his eyes reached toward her voice and his lips writhed. ""He's sulkin',"" said
Granma. ""I tol' you he was tricky. He was gonna sneak away this mornin' so he
wouldn't have to come. An' then his hip got a-hurtin',"" she said disgustedly. ""He's jus'
sulkin'. I seen him when he wouldn't talk to nobody before.""
Casy said gently, ""He ain't sulkin', Granma. He's sick.""
""Oh!"" She looked down at the old man again. ""Sick bad, you think?""
""Purty bad, Granma.""
For a moment she hesitated uncertainly. ""Well,"" she said quickly, ""why ain't you
prayin'? You're a preacher, ain't you?""
Casy's strong fingers blundered over to Grampa's wrist and clasped around it. ""I tol'
you, Granma. I ain't a preacher no more.""
""Pray anyway,"" she ordered. ""You know all the stuff by heart.""
""I can't,"" said Casy. ""I don't know what to pray for or who to pray to.""
Granma's eyes wandered away and came to rest on Sairy. ""He won't pray,"" she said.
""D'I ever tell ya how Ruthie prayed when she was a little skinner? Says, 'Now I lay me
down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. An' when she got there the cupboard
was bare, an' so the poor dog got none. Amen.' That's jus' what she done."" The shadow
of someone walking between the tent and the sun crossed the canvas.
Grampa seemed to be struggling; all his muscles twitched. And suddenly he jarred
as though under a heavy blow. He lay still and his breath was stopped. Casy looked
down at the old man's face and saw that it was turning a blackish purple. Sairy touched
Casy's shoulder. She whispered, ""His tongue, his tongue, his tongue.""
Casy nodded. ""Get in front a Granma."" He pried the tight jaws apart and reached
into the old man's throat for the tongue. And as he lifted it clear, a rattling breath came
out, and a sobbing breath was indrawn. Casy found a stick on the ground and held
down the tongue with it, and the uneven breath rattled in and out.
Granma hopped about like a chicken. ""Pray,"" she said. ""Pray, you. Pray, I tell ya.""
Sairy tried to hold her back. ""Pray, goddamn you!"" Granma cried.
Casy looked up at her for a moment. The rasping breath came louder and more
unevenly. ""Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name—""
""Glory!"" shouted Granma.
""Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done—on earth—as it is in Heaven.""
""Amen.""
A long gasping sigh came from the open mouth, and then a crying release of air.
""Give us this day—our daily bread—and forgive us—"" The breathing had stopped.
Casy looked down into Grampa's eyes and they were clear and deep and penetrating,
and there was a knowing serene look in them.
""Hallelujah!"" said Granma. ""Go on.""
""Amen,"" said Casy.
Granma was still then. And outside the tent all the noise had stopped. A car whished
by on the highway. Casy still knelt on the floor beside the mattress. The people outside
were listening, standing quietly intent on the sounds of dying. Sairy took Granma by
the arm and led her outside, and Granma moved with dignity and held her head high.
She walked for the family and held her head straight for the family. Sairy took her to a
mattress lying on the ground and sat her down on it. And Granma looked straight
ahead, proudly, for she was on show now. The tent was still, and at last Casy spread
the tent flaps with his hands and stepped out.
Pa asked softly, ""What was it?""
""Stroke,"" said Casy. ""A good quick stroke.""
Life began to move again. The sun touched the horizon and flattened over it. And
along the highway there came a long line of huge freight trucks with red sides. They
rumbled along, putting a little earthquake in the ground, and the standing exhaust pipes
sputtered blue smoke from the Diesel oil. One man drove each truck, and his relief
man slept in a bunk high up against the ceiling. But the trucks never stopped; they
thundered day and night and the ground shook under their heavy march.
The family became a unit. Pa squatted down on the ground, and Uncle John beside
him. Pa was the head of the family now. Ma stood behind him. Noah and Tom and Al
squatted, and the preacher sat down, and then reclined on his elbow. Connie and Rose
of Sharon walked at a distance. Now Ruthie and Winfield, clattering up with a bucket
of water held between them, felt the change, and they slowed up and set down the
bucket and moved quietly to stand with Ma.
Granma sat proudly, coldly, until the group was formed, until no one looked at her,
and then she lay down and covered her face with her arm. The red sun set and left a
shining twilight on the land, so that faces were bright in the evening and eyes shone in
reflection of the sky. The evening picked up light where it could.
Pa said, ""It was in Mr. Wilson's tent.""
Uncle John nodded. ""He loaned his tent.""
""Fine friendly folks,"" Pa said softly.
Wilson stood by his broken car, and Sairy had gone to the mattress to sit beside
Granma, but Sairy was careful not to touch her.
Pa called, ""Mr. Wilson!"" The man scuffed near and squatted down, and Sairy came
and stood beside him. Pa said, ""We're thankful to you folks.""
""We're proud to help,"" said Wilson.
""We're beholden to you,"" said Pa.
""There's no beholden in a time of dying,"" said Wilson, and Sairy echoed him,
""Never no beholden.""
Al said, ""I'll fix your car—me an' Tom will."" And Al looked proud that he could
return the family's obligation.
""We could use some help."" Wilson admitted the retiring of the obligation.
Pa said, ""We got to figger what to do. They's laws. You got to report a death, an'
when you do that, they either take forty dollars for the undertaker or they take him for
a pauper.""
Uncle John broke in, ""We never did have no paupers.""
Tom said, ""Maybe we got to learn. We never got booted off no land before,
neither.""
""We done it clean,"" said Pa. ""There can't no blame be laid on us. We never took
nothin' we couldn' pay; we never suffered no man's charity. When Tom here got in
trouble we could hold up our heads. He only done what any man would a done.""
""Then what'll we do?"" Uncle John asked.
""We go in like the law says an' they'll come out for him. We on'y got a hundred an'
fifty dollars. They take forty to bury Grampa an' we won't get to California—or else
they'll bury him a pauper."" The men stirred restively, and they studied the darkening
ground in front of their knees.
Pa said softly, ""Grampa buried his pa with his own hand, done it in dignity, an'
shaped the grave nice with his own shovel. That was a time when a man had the right
to be buried by his own son an' a son had the right to bury his own father.""
""The law says different now,"" said Uncle John.
""Sometimes the law can't be foller'd no way,"" said Pa. ""Not in decency, anyways.
They's lots a times you can't. When Floyd was loose an' goin' wild, law said we got to
give him up—an' nobody give him up. Sometimes a fella got to sift the law. I'm sayin'
now I got the right to bury my own pa. Anybody got somepin to say?""
The preacher rose high on his elbow. ""Law changes,"" he said, ""but 'got to's' go on.
You got the right to do what you got to do.""
Pa turned to Uncle John. ""It's your right too, John. You got any word against?""
""No word against,"" said Uncle John. ""On'y it's like hidin' him in the night. Grampa's
way was t'come out a-shootin'.""
Pa said ashamedly, ""We can't do like Grampa done. We got to get to California 'fore
our money gives out.""
Tom broke in, ""Sometimes fellas workin' dig up a man an' then they raise hell an'
figger he been killed. The gov'ment's got more interest in a dead man than a live one.
They'll go hell-scrapin' tryin' to fin' out who he was and how he died. I offer we put a
note of writin' in a bottle an' lay it with Grampa, tellin' who he is an' how he died, an'
why he's buried here.""
Pa nodded agreement. ""Tha's good. Wrote out in a nice han'. Be not so lonesome
too, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not jus' a old fella lonesome underground. Any
more stuff to say?"" The circle was silent.
Pa turned his head to Ma. ""You'll lay 'im out?""
""I'll lay 'im out,"" said Ma. ""But who's to get supper?""
Sairy Wilson said, ""I'll get supper. You go right ahead. Me an' that big girl of
yourn.""
""We sure thank you,"" said Ma. ""Noah, you get into them kegs an' bring out some
nice pork. Salt won't be deep in it yet, but it'll be right nice eatin'.""
""We got a half sack a potatoes,"" said Sairy.
Ma said, ""Gimme two half-dollars."" Pa dug in his pocket and gave her the silver.
She found the basin, filled it full of water, and went into the tent. It was nearly dark in
there. Sairy came in and lighted a candle and stuck it upright on a box and then she
went out. For a moment Ma looked down at the dead old man. And then in pity she
tore a strip from her own apron and tied up his jaw. She straightened his limbs, folded
his hands over his chest. She held his eyelids down and laid a silver piece on each one.
She buttoned his shirt and washed his face.
Sairy looked in, saying, ""Can I give you any help?""
Ma looked slowly up. ""Come in,"" she said. ""I like to talk to ya.""
""That's a good big girl you got,"" said Sairy. ""She's right in peelin' potatoes. What
can I do to help?""
""I was gonna wash Grampa all over,"" said Ma, ""but he got no other clo'es to put on.
An' 'course your quilt's spoilt. Can't never get the smell a death from a quilt. I seen a
dog growl an' shake at a mattress my ma died on, an' that was two years later. We'll
drop 'im in your quilt. We'll make it up to you. We got a quilt for you.""
Sairy said, ""You shouldn' talk like that. We're proud to help. I ain't felt so—safe in a
long time. People needs—to help.""
Ma nodded. ""They do,"" she said. She looked long into the old whiskery face, with
its bound jaw and silver eyes shining in the candlelight. ""He ain't gonna look natural.
We'll wrop him up.""
""The ol' lady took it good.""
""Why, she's so old,"" said Ma, ""maybe she don't even rightly know what happened.
Maybe she won't really know for quite a while. Besides, us folks takes a pride holdin'
in. My pa used to say, 'Anybody can break down. It takes a man not to.' We always try
to hold in."" She folded the quilt neatly about Grampa's legs and around his shoulders.
She brought the corner of the quilt over his head like a cowl and pulled it down over
his face. Sairy handed her half-a-dozen big safety pins, and she pinned the quilt neatly
and tightly about the long package. And at last she stood up. ""It won't be bad burying,""
she said. ""We got a preacher to see him in, an' his folks is all aroun'."" Suddenly she
swayed a little, and Sairy went to her and steadied her. ""It's sleep—"" Ma said in a
shamed tone. ""No, I'm awright. We been so busy gettin' ready, you see.""
""Come out in the air,"" Sairy said.
""Yeah, I'm all done here."" Sairy blew out the candle and the two went out.
A bright fire burned in the bottom of the little gulch. And Tom, with sticks and
wire, had made supports from which two kettles hung and bubbled furiously, and good
steam poured out under the lids. Rose of Sharon knelt on the ground out of range of the
burning heat, and she had a long spoon in her hand. She saw Ma come out of the tent,
and she stood up and went to her.
""Ma,"" she said. ""I got to ask.""
""Scared again?"" Ma asked. ""Why, you can't get through nine months without
sorrow.""
""But will it—hurt the baby?""
Ma said, ""They used to be a sayin', 'A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile.'
Isn't that so, Mis' Wilson?""
""I heard it like that,"" said Sairy. ""An' I heard the other: 'Born outa too much joy'll be
a doleful boy.'""
""I'm all jumpy inside,"" said Rose of Sharon.
""Well, we ain't none of us jumpin' for fun,"" said Ma. ""You jes' keep watchin' the
pots.""
On the edge of the ring of firelight the men had gathered. For tools they had a
shovel and a mattock. Pa marked out the ground—eight feet long and three feet wide.
The work went on in relays. Pa chopped the earth with the mattock and then Uncle
John shoveled it out. Al chopped and Tom shoveled. Noah chopped and Connie
shoveled. And the hole drove down, for the work never diminished in speed. The
shovels of dirt flew out of the hole in quick spurts. When Tom was shoulder deep in
the rectangular pit, he said, ""How deep, Pa?""
""Good an' deep. A couple feet more. You get out now, Tom, and get that paper
wrote.""
Tom boosted himself out of the hole and Noah took his place. Tom went to Ma,
where she tended the fire. ""We got any paper an' pen, Ma?""
Ma shook her head slowly, ""No-o. That's one thing we didn' bring."" She looked
toward Sairy. And the little woman walked quickly to her tent. She brought back a
Bible and a half pencil. ""Here,"" she said. ""They's a clear page in front. Use that an' tear
it out."" She handed book and pencil to Tom.
Tom sat down in the firelight. He squinted his eyes in concentration, and at last
wrote slowly and carefully on the end paper in big clear letters: ""This here is William
James Joad, dyed of a stroke, old old man. His fokes bured him becaws they got no
money to pay for funerls. Nobody kilt him. Jus a stroke and he dyed."" He stopped.
""Ma, listen to this here."" He read it slowly to her.
""Why, that soun's nice,"" she said. ""Can't you stick on somepin from Scripture so it'll
be religious? Open up an' git a sayin', somepin outa Scripture.""
""Got to be short,"" said Tom. ""I ain't got much room lef' on the page.""
Sairy said, ""How 'bout 'God have mercy on his soul'?""
""No,"" said Tom. ""Sounds too much like he was hung. I'll copy somepin."" He turned
the pages and read, mumbling his lips, saying the words under his breath. ""Here's a
good short one,"" he said. ""'An' Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord.'""
""Don't mean nothin',"" said Ma. ""Long's you're gonna put one down, it might's well
mean somepin.""
Sairy said, ""Turn to Psalms, over further. You kin always get somepin outa Psalms.""
Tom flipped the pages and looked down the verses. ""Now here is one,"" he said.
""This here's a nice one, just blowed full a religion: 'Blessed is he whose transgression
is forgiven, whose sin is covered.' How's that?""
""That's real nice,"" said Ma. ""Put that one in.""
Tom wrote it carefully. Ma rinsed and wiped a fruit jar and Tom screwed the lid
down tight on it. ""Maybe the preacher ought to wrote it,"" he said.
Ma said, ""No, the preacher wan't no kin."" She took the jar from him and went into
the dark tent. She unpinned the covering and slipped the fruit jar in under the thin cold
hands and pinned the comforter tight again. And then she went back to the fire.
The men came from the grave, their faces shining with perspiration. ""Awright,"" said
Pa. He and John and Noah and Al went into the tent, and they came out carrying the
long, pinned bundle between them. They carried it to the grave. Pa leaped into the hole
and received the bundle in his arms and laid it gently down. Uncle John put out a hand
and helped Pa out of the hole. Pa asked, ""How about Granma?""
""I'll see,"" Ma said. She walked to the mattress and looked down at the old woman
for a moment. Then she went back to the grave. ""Sleepin',"" she said. ""Maybe she'd hold
it against me, but I ain't a-gonna wake her up. She's tar'd.""
Pa said, ""Where at's the preacher? We oughta have a prayer.""
Tom said, ""I seen him walkin' down the road. He don't like to pray no more.""
""Don't like to pray?""
""No,"" said Tom. ""He ain't a preacher no more. He figgers it ain't right to fool people
actin' like a preacher when he ain't a preacher. I bet he went away so nobody wouldn'
ast him.""
Casy had come quietly near, and he heard Tom speaking. ""I didn' run away,"" he
said. ""I'll he'p you folks, but I won't fool ya.""
Pa said, ""Won't you say a few words? Ain't none of our folks ever been buried
without a few words.""
""I'll say 'em,"" said the preacher.
Connie led Rose of Sharon to the graveside, she reluctant. ""You got to,"" Connie
said. ""It ain't decent not to. It'll jus' be a little.""
The firelight fell on the grouped people, showing their faces and their eyes,
dwindling on their dark clothes. All the hats were off now. The light danced, jerking
over the people.
Casy said, ""It'll be a short one."" He bowed his head, and the others followed his
lead. Casy said solemnly, ""This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I
don't know whether he was good or bad, but that don't matter much. He was alive, an'
that's what matters. An' now he's dead, an' that don't matter. Heard a fella tell a poem
one time, an' he says, 'All that lives is holy.' Got to thinkin', an' purty soon it means
more than the words says. An' I wouldn' pray for a ol' fella that's dead. He's awright.
He got a job to do, but it's all laid out for 'im an' there's on'y one way to do it. But us,
we got a job to do, an' they's a thousan' ways, an' we don' know which one to take. An'
if I was to pray, it'd be for the folks that don' know which way to turn. Grampa here, he
got the easy straight. An' now cover 'im up and let 'im get to his work."" He raised his
head.
Pa said, ""Amen,"" and the others muttered, ""A–men."" Then Pa took the shovel, half
filled it with dirt, and spread it gently into the black hole. He handed the shovel to
Uncle John, and John dropped in a shovelful. Then the shovel went from hand to hand
until every man had his turn. When all had taken their duty and their right, Pa attacked
the mound of loose dirt and hurriedly filled the hole. The women moved back to the
fire to see to supper. Ruthie and Winfield watched, absorbed.
Ruthie said solemnly, ""Grampa's down under there."" And Winfield looked at her
with horrified eyes. And then he ran away to the fire and sat on the ground and sobbed
to himself.
Pa half filled the hole, and then he stood panting with the effort while Uncle John
finished it. And John was shaping up the mound when Tom stopped him. ""Listen,""
Tom said. ""'F we leave a grave, they'll have it open in no time. We got to hide it. Level
her off an' we'll strew dry grass. We got to do that.""
Pa said, ""I didn' think a that. It ain't right to leave a grave unmounded.""
""Can't he'p it,"" said Tom. ""They'd dig 'im right up, an' we'd get it for breakin' the
law. You know what I get if I break the law.""
""Yeah,"" Pa said. ""I forgot that."" He took the shovel from John and leveled the grave.
""She'll sink, come winter,"" he said.
""Can't he'p that,"" said Tom. ""We'll be a long ways off by winter. Tromp her in good,
an' we'll strew stuff over her.""
WHEN THE PORK and potatoes were done the families sat about on the ground and
ate, and they were quiet, staring into the fire. Wilson, tearing a slab of meat with his
teeth, sighed with contentment. ""Nice eatin' pig,"" he said.
""Well,"" Pa explained, ""we had a couple shoats, an' we thought we might's well eat
'em. Can't get nothin' for 'em. When we get kinda use' ta movin' an' Ma can set up
bread, why, it'll be pretty nice, seein' the country an' two kags a' pork right in the truck.
How long you folks been on the road?""
Wilson cleared his teeth with his tongue and swallowed. ""We ain't been lucky,"" he
said. ""We been three weeks from home.""
""Why, God Awmighty, we aim to be in California in ten days or less.""
Al broke in, ""I dunno, Pa. With that load we're packin', we maybe ain't never gonna
get there. Not if they's mountains to go over.""
They were silent about the fire. Their faces were turned downward and their hair
and foreheads showed in the firelight. Above the little dome of the firelight the
summer stars shone thinly, and the heat of the day was gradually withdrawing. On her
mattress, away from the fire, Granma whimpered softly like a puppy. The heads of all
turned in her direction.
Ma said, ""Rosasharn, like a good girl go lay down with Granma. She needs
somebody now. She's knowin', now.""
Rose of Sharon got to her feet and walked to the mattress and lay beside the old
woman, and the murmur of their soft voices drifted to the fire. Rose of Sharon and
Granma whispered together on the mattress.
Noah said, ""Funny thing is—losin' Grampa ain't made me feel no different than I
done before. I ain't no sadder than I was.""
""It's just the same thing,"" Casy said. ""Grampa an' the old place, they was jus' the
same thing.""
Al said, ""It's a goddamn shame. He been talkin' what he's gonna do, how he gonna
squeeze grapes over his head an' let the juice run in his whiskers, an' all stuff like that.""
Casy said, ""He was foolin', all the time. I think he knowed it. An' Grampa didn' die
tonight. He died the minute you took 'im off the place.""
""You sure a that?"" Pa cried.
""Why, no. Oh, he was breathin',"" Casy went on, ""but he was dead. He was that
place, an' he knowed it.""
Uncle John said, ""Did you know he was a-dyin'?""
""Yeah,"" said Casy. ""I knowed it.""
John gazed at him, and a horror grew in his face. ""An' you didn' tell nobody?""
""What good?"" Casy asked.
""We—we might of did somepin.""
""What?""
""I don' know, but—""
""No,"" Casy said, ""you couldn' a done nothin'. Your way was fixed an' Grampa didn'
have no part in it. He didn' suffer none. Not after fust thing this mornin'. He's jus'
stayin' with the lan'. He couldn' leave it.""
Uncle John sighed deeply.
Wilson said, ""We hadda leave my brother Will."" The heads turned toward him.
""Him an' me had forties side by side. He's older'n me. Neither one ever drove a car.
Well, we went in an' we sol' ever'thing. Will, he bought a car, an' they give him a kid to
show 'im how to use it. So the afternoon 'fore we're gonna start, Will an' Aunt Minnie
go a-practicin'. Will he comes to a bend in the road an' he yells 'Whoa' an' yanks back,
an' he goes through a fence. An' he yells 'Whoa, you bastard' an' tromps down on the
gas an' goes over into a gulch. An' there he was. Didn't have nothin' more to sell an'
didn't have no car. But it were his own damn fault, praise God. He's so damn mad he
won't come along with us, jus' set there a-cussin' an' a-cussin'.""
""What's he gonna do?""
""I dunno. He's too mad to figger. An' we couldn' wait. On'y had eighty-five dollars
to go on. We couldn' set an' cut it up, but we et it up anyways. Didn' go a hunderd mile
when a tooth in the rear end bust, an' cost thirty dollars to get her fix', an' then we got
to get a tire, an' then a spark plug cracked, an' Sairy got sick. Had ta stop ten days. An'
now the goddamn car is bust again, an' money's gettin' low. I dunno when we'll ever
get to California. 'F I could on'y fix a car, but I don' know nothin' about cars.""
Al asked importantly, ""What's the matter?""
""Well, she jus' won't run. Starts an' farts an' stops. In a minute she'll start again, an'
then 'fore you can git her goin', she peters out again.""
""Runs a minute an' then dies?""
""Yes, sir. An' I can't keep her a-goin' no matter how much gas I give her. Got worse
an' worse, an' now I cain't get her a-movin' a-tall.""
Al was very proud and very mature, then. ""I think you got a plugged gas line. I'll
blow her out for ya.""
And Pa was proud too. ""He's a good hand with a car,"" Pa said.
""Well, I'll sure thank ya for a han'. I sure will. Makes a fella kinda feel—like a little
kid, when he can't fix nothin'. When we get to California I aim to get me a nice car.
Maybe she won't break down.""
Pa said, ""When we get there. Gettin' there's the trouble.""
""Oh, but she's worth it,"" said Wilson. ""Why, I seen han'bills how they need folks to
pick fruit, an' good wages. Why, jus' think how it's gonna be, under them shady trees apickin' fruit an' takin' a bite ever' once in a while. Why, hell, they don't care how much
you eat 'cause they got so much. An' with them good wages, maybe a fella can get
hisself a little piece a land an' work out for extra cash. Why, hell, in a couple years I
bet a fella could have a place of his own.""
Pa said, ""We seen them han'bills. I got one right here."" He took out his purse and
from it took a folded orange handbill. In black type it said, ""Pea Pickers Wanted in
California. Good Wages All Season. 800 Pickers Wanted.""
Wilson looked at it curiously. ""Why, that's the one I seen. The very same one. You
s'pose—maybe they got all eight hunderd awready?""
Pa said, ""This is jus' one little part a California. Why, that's the secon' biggest State
we got. S'pose they did get all them eight hunderd. They's plenty places else. I rather
pick fruit anyways. Like you says, under them trees an' pickin' fruit—why, even the
kids'd like to do that.""
Suddenly Al got up and walked to the Wilsons' touring car. He looked in for a
moment and then came back and sat down.
""You can't fix her tonight,"" Wilson said.
""I know. I'll get to her in the morning.""
Tom had watched his young brother carefully. ""I was thinkin' somepin like that
myself,"" he said.
Noah asked, ""What you two fellas talkin' about?""
Tom and Al went silent, each waiting for the other. ""You tell 'em,"" Al said finally.
""Well, maybe it's no good, an' maybe it ain't the same thing Al's thinking. Here she
is, anyways. We got a overload, but Mr. and Mis' Wilson ain't. If some of us folks
could ride with them an' take some a their light stuff in the truck, we wouldn't break no
springs an' we could git up hills. An' me an' Al both knows about a car, so we could
keep that car a-rollin'. We'd keep together on the road an' it'd be good for ever'body.""
Wilson jumped up. ""Why, sure. Why, we'd be proud. We certain'y would. You hear
that, Sairy?""
""It's a nice thing,"" said Sairy. ""Wouldn' be a burden on you folks?""
""No, by God,"" said Pa. ""Wouldn't be no burden at all. You'd be helpin' us.""
Wilson settled back uneasily. ""Well, I dunno.""
""What's a matter, don' you wanta?""
""Well, ya see—I on'y got 'bout thirty dollars lef', an' I won't be no burden.""
Ma said, ""You won't be no burden. Each'll help each, an' we'll all git to California.
Sairy Wilson he'ped lay Grampa out,"" and she stopped. The relationship was plain.
Al cried, ""That car'll take six easy. Say me to drive, an' Rosasharn an' Connie and
Granma. Then we take the big light stuff an' pile her on the truck. An' we'll trade off
ever' so often."" He spoke loudly, for a load of worry was lifted from him.
They smiled shyly and looked down at the ground. Pa fingered the dusty earth with
his fingertips. He said, ""Ma favors a white house with oranges growin' around. They's
a big pitcher on a calendar she seen.""
Sairy said, ""If I get sick again, you got to go on an' get there. We ain't a-goin' to
burden.""
Ma looked carefully at Sairy, and she seemed to see for the first time the paintormented eyes and the face that was haunted and shrinking with pain. And Ma said,
""We gonna see you get through. You said yourself, you can't let help go unwanted.""
She studied her wrinkled hands in the firelight. ""We got to get some sleep tonight.""
She stood up.
""Grampa—it's like he's dead a year,"" Ma said.
The families moved lazily to their sleep, yawning luxuriously. Ma sloshed the tin
plates off a little and rubbed the grease free with a flour sack. The fire died down and
the stars descended. Few passenger cars went by on the highway now, but the transport
trucks thundered by at intervals and put little earthquakes in the ground. In the ditch
the cars were hardly visible under the starlight. A tied dog howled at the service station
down the road. The families were quiet and sleeping, and the field mice grew bold and
scampered about among the mattresses. Only Sairy Wilson was awake. She stared into
the sky and braced her body firmly against pain.",John Steinbeck,1963,"[67, 50, 42, 43, 50, 63, 68]",7
657,How Much Is That Doggie In The Window,"[Chorus]
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale

[Verse 1]
I must take a trip to California
And leave my poor sweetheart alone
If he has a dog he won't be lonesome
And the doggie will have a good home

[Chorus]
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale

[Verse 2]
I read in the paper there are robbers (Arf, arf)
With flash lights that shine in the dark
My love needs a doggie to protect him
And scare them away with one bark
I don't want a bunny or a kitty
I don't want a parrot that talks
I don't want a bowl of little fishies
He can't take a goldfish for a walk

[Chorus]
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
The one with the waggly tail
How much is that doggie in the window? (Arf, arf)
I do hope that doggie's for sale",Patti Page,1963,"[69, 69, 71, 71, 89, 92, 99]",7
658,The Popeye Waddle,"You see
Things dipped in Benaz's life when
Dad crashed his car lost minicab license
He picked fights with Ma
He'd drink nights at bars
Wished he had a son
Redundant and drunk
Benaz tried stopping from shoving her mum around
So now he beats her like it makes him proud

The fat lips meant she had to quit Topshop
And now they beef and argue nonstop
She won't marry some freshie cousin, she's telling him
He's only in it for the passport and benefits
But Dad doesn't get it or wanna
You see
He's an immigrant with nothing, so his currency's honor
He already promised the relative she would be the bride for his son
Her second cousin said it would please her
But the young girl doesn't think like the geeza
She won't let him shut away her heart like a dealer
Mum backed her up and he left it
But to him this is worse than death, disrespected

So now she doesn't work but she runs domestics
Then one day at Tescos who woulda guessed it
The self-service checkout wasn't workin'
Then, outta nowhere, ""Can I help you, ma'am?""
Get the hell out
It's her first crush from primary school
Haven't met since then, but when she smiles he still drools
""Long time, no see""
""Yeah, the irony""
Cool
Soon, buying milk and eggs becomes a nightly excuse

His name's Akin
An orphan, ain't got many friends
Suits Benaz, she stays low key in the ends
He's not the usual wannabe macho guy with the Benz
He's studying optometry, skinny, not hench
He examines her green eyes, his heart does breakbeats
Smiles are swapped, soon, they find place to creep
They walk deep in woods, where grass carpets feet
Phone bills grow in the dark, half-asleep

It's the real deal, he wanna do it proper
Puts on best suit, knocks on door to ask the old codger
Akin asks her dad and he makes a little speech
But all he gets is a no, like a kick in the teeth
'Cause his grandad's from the wrong tribe or village
He's from the wrong subset of the same religion
It's not a way to pick for yourself like you're the English
""Don't ever try to see her again, this is finished.""

But love's persistent
Benaz and Akin can't resist magnetism
She feels so blue, but he soothes the hurt
Says they can't stop love and calls her his little Smurf

But soon they're seen by boys from the community
That go out and fuck white girls with impunity
Oh, gee! Misogyny meets old school hypocrisy
""What we do is fine, but our women must live honestly.""
Word spreads, other people's whispers twisted
This innocent love into sinful kisses
""Control your daughter, what an awful family""
""She already backed out of a marriage and now she sleeps with any old boy.""
Truth is, she's a virgin, yeah
But gossip is rarely the true version
Hurting the family the name is like losing the life savings
So Dad collects payment as bailiff
Pounds her flesh, blood speckles all over the loo
Words can break bones and turn your eyes blue
She zones out, goes numb as he kicks and slaps her
She listens to that rained down pitter and patter
The same pitiful rhythm of hypocritical chatter
From those who call her ""whore, slut, bitch"" and slap her
No matter

She has a special concealer for these mornings
Applies to eyelids while the violent are yawning
Dawn brings a silence, she holds it close
She's a lily in its lake and for now, she floats
With faith in her heart, she thinks
Maybe she should just play a part
In some imaginary poets tragic heart
'cause she's not gonna live a half life
She cleans pus from her hard eye
Smiles in the mirror, decides
Her choice either disobey Dad and risk death
Or prison jailed in her own home and sit there
She thinks, ""Yes, I'll run away with Akin.""

Sends text, wears frown as crown, such a pitiful princess
Says ""Meet me in the forest if you honestly love me
Before dawn comes and the sky's still lovely
Dad beat me up again, I want you to hug me
We gotta run away, bring clothes and money.""
'Cause she knows she's good
She's fed up of should
She puts on her red hood and rides into the woods

[HOOK]
If I knew I'd live in shame
Just to be near you
I would do it all again
I would do it all again

If I knew I'd feel this pain
Just to be near you
I would do it all again
I would do it all again

When she went into the woods that day she was in for a big surprise
A bunch of guys from 'round the way
Drunk after a rave
Spied them both with suitcases running away
They'd gotten away
Like hyenas fast upon them
As if drunk sleazebags must guard her honor
Some of them knew her cousin, so they grassed her properly
To the family. What Daddy did could pass for horror
She lost use of her right eye
Eats through a straw
Right leg in a plaster at the hospital ward

Akin sneaks in to visit her with scars on his jaw
From where Benaz's cousin's knuckles waged a war
He cries, and he draws a little heart on the plaster
Puts a kiss on her eye, tells her now it will heal faster
She said ""I told doctors that I happened to fall over
It's funny you call me Smurf, now I'm blue all over
Be strong, my love, and try not to cry
And from on don't call me Smurf, you should call me Popeye.""

He says, ""No more jokes. This mess must stop.""
Convinces her she has to get some help from the cops
""I've tried twice when they beatin' me, they heard the screams
But Mum says that we don't need police, they turn and leave""
But Akin brought a constable with him
So Benaz spills the beans in the hospital
Sittin' there with her drip and the stitches
But it's clear that after six minutes he thinks that she's fibbing
Isn't really trusting his witness
He says, ""The nurse told me that you fell down the stairs
Now you're changing your story
And though I see that you're scared
Your parents are crying
It doesn't make sense what you said
I can't put you in protection 'cause there's nothin' proven yet
Try going to a women's shelter
There isn't one nearby?
It shut down? Well, sorry, I can't help ya
Well, don't try and live with your fella
If anyone bothers you over there, well
You can just give us a bell, love
But it seems to me like you just want a council house
Stop wasting police time, please, that's all for now""

And as PC Plod is leaving, her family sees him
They creep in the ward silently seething
Benaz can't control her breathing, knows it's open season now
But she's too proud to plead with them
Akin asks them to leave
That they even came is hard to believe
Squares up to her father and grits teeth
Uncles and cousin, brothers are ready to rough him up
But her mother steps forward, say ""No, let's discuss it.""

""Come home, Benaz. I fought for you once
And if you really want this man as your husband
Then I'll trust him.""
Her father apologizes, tries touching her, mumbling
His agony for her to move out the way, but she doesn't
He says, ""Akin, what I did is hard to forgive, I understand
But if your heart is as big as she thinks it is
Don't make her choose between you and her family.""
Her mom says, ""It's alright, but my child, Benaz don't abandon me

Stranded, she feels primeval attraction
Her genes hanker for family
Sees hope in the old man's defeat
She wonders if her mother might collapse if she leaves
Breathe deep, says she'll give it a try, at least
Akin can't believe it, but he follows her lead
Makes peace, shakes hands, an uncomfortable squeeze
Benaz's one eye swells up in relief
If justice is blind, hope looks with one eye (and leaps)

[HOOK]
If I knew I'd live in shame
Just to be near you
I would do it all again
I would do it all again

If I knew I'd feel this pain
Just to be near you
I would do it all again
I would do it all again

She waddles through the door on crutches
Rushed in from hospital
They promised her the wedding would come quick
Dad says, ""There's flowers and food to choose, come pick.""
Her heart throbs
She half hops and half runs in
But something doesn't quite fit
""Why are the curtains shut, Ma, and why don't you sit?""
There's an empty suitcase but the handles are ripped
White cloth lines the inside, freshly stitched

Akin was told to go wait at the mosque with the ring
She's home alone, feels the walls closing in
He said he'd call her when he gets there but her phone don't ring
And in that moment, she knows, her dad planned the whole thing

Akin got rushed by her cousins
Bottled by the one she wouldn't marry
Who wishes that she loved him
He tried struggling
But seven of them all punching him
He bleeds 'til his blood runs thin
Eyes shut, lights dim

Benaz is on her own again
Silence falls
Reminds her of dawn
Her heart blinks, Mum starts to cry
Her mask slips, ""How far can I help you, the way you behaved
You asked for it.""
Dad just stares and broods
Then he bends down, starts to undo the lace from his shoes
Holds them between his fists like an improvised noose
Benaz nods and then she lets a fire run loose

Swings her crutch far
She screams and chucks vase
""Fuck you, Fuck your honor, what about my heart?""
Her dad's on top of her now and he's blocking her arms
He's stopping her from scratching and bottles her hard
He's sitting on her leg as she gasps
She won't give up 'til the last
Legs broken, arms pinned, so she spits on the bastard
Blood gathers in her face
The pressure presses against
The neck and Dad tightens it and mumbles a prayer
Knuckles whiten
The lace frays
That windpipe tries to be brave, but
Now not even love can save her

Laces tighten around the neck
A world darkens
Cuts into her flesh
As her arteries harden
The sound of her mum screaming distorts the laughter
The last thing she sees, the weeping face of her father

Eyes close
And her thoughts drift off as they do
To the memory of her daddy tying her shoes
By the school gates
But now he dumps her dead in a suitcase
Buries her in the garden with no mark on the youth's grave

They call police, say she just disappeared
They plead on T.V. and it's unsolved for years
Akin is brain-damaged, sleeps rough on the streets
He goes mad like Majnu, I know it's tough to believe
But he sleeps on concrete and in the dark he grieves
Although he doesn't know why, he can feel his heart bleed
When he closes one eye, he can almost half see
In his mind is something lost, but he'll never find peace

Police find the body in the end
They say they're sorry and forced marriage and honor killings must end
People say the parents are thugs
But they still fuck girls, then judge girls
Say they should wear hijabs
And soon enough, the cycle restarts

So play this to your mates
Based on a true story of Benaz
Dedicated to her and a hundred other pieces of grass
'Til the end of forever, there are no lasts
'Cause in the corner of some English field
Lies the true price of love

[HOOK}
If I knew I'd live in shame

659,What To Do With Laurie,"For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.

Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better, for Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in their heads. Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with arsenicum and books. Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.

All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.

All were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and deserved praise. So they did, but their mistake was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson through much anxiety and regret.

""Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels. You know Mother told us not to forget them."" said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's departure.

""I'm too tired to go this afternoon,"" replied Meg, rocking comfortably as she sewed.

""Can't you, Jo?"" asked Beth.

""Too stormy for me with my cold.""

""I thought it was almost well.""

""It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well enough to go to the Hummels',"" said Jo, laughing, but looking a little ashamed of her inconsistency.

""Why don't you go yourself?"" asked Meg.

""I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't know what to do for it. Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and Lottchen takes care of it. But it gets sicker and sicker, and I think you or Hannah ought to go.""

Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.

""Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth, the air will do you good,"" said Jo, adding apologetically, ""I'd go but I want to finish my writing.""

""My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you would go,"" said Beth.

""Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,"" suggested Meg.

So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come, Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.

""Christopher Columbus! What's the matter?"" cried Jo, as Beth put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly. . .

""You've had the scarlet fever, haven't you?""

""Years ago, when Meg did. Why?""

""Then I'll tell you. Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!""

""What baby?""

""Mrs. Hummel's. It died in my lap before she got home,"" cried Beth with a sob.

""My poor dear, how dreadful for you! I ought to have gone,"" said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother's big chair, with a remorseful face.

""It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad! I saw in a minute it was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so I took Baby and let Lotty rest. It seemed asleep, but all of a sudden if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still. I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't stir, and I knew it was dead.""

""Don't cry, dear! What did you do?""

""I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the doctor. He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna, who have sore throats. 'Scarlet fever, ma'am. Ought to have called me before,' he said crossly. Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever.""

""No, you won't!"" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. ""Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself! What shall we do?""

""Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I looked in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat, and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel better,"" said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead and trying to look well.

""If Mother was only at home!"" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book, and feeling that Washington was an immense way off. She read a page, looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then said gravely, ""You've been over the baby every day for more than a week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid you are going to have it, Beth. I'll call Hannah, she knows all about sickness.""

""Don't let Amy come. She never had it, and I should hate to give it to her. Can't you and Meg have it over again?"" asked Beth, anxiously.

""I guess not. Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!"" muttered Jo, as she went to consult Hannah.

The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

""Now I'll tell you what we'll do,"" said Hannah, when she had examined and questioned Beth, ""we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take a look at you, dear, and see that we start right. Then we'll send Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way, and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two.""

""I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest,"" began Meg, looking anxious and self-reproachful.

""I shall, because it's my fault she is sick. I told Mother I'd do the errands, and I haven't,"" said Jo decidedly.

""Which will you have, Beth? There ain't no need of but one,"" aid Hannah.

""Jo, please."" And Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which effectually settled that point.

""I'll go and tell Amy,"" said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo did.

Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to Aunt March. Meg reasoned, pleaded, and commanded, all in vain. Amy protested that she would not go, and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done. Before she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with her head in the sofa cushions. She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, ""Now be a sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got. You go to Aunt March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking, and we'll have capital times. Won't that be better than moping here?""

""I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way,"" began Amy, in an injured voice.

""Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well. You don't want to be sick, do you?""

""No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been with Beth all the time.""

""That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that you may escape it. Change of air and care will keep you well, I dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more lightly. I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet fever is no joke, miss.""

""But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross,"" said Amy, looking rather frightened.

""It won't be dull with me popping in every day to tell you how Beth is, and take you out gallivanting. The old lady likes me, and I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us, whatever we do.""

""Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?""

""On my honor as a gentleman.""

""And come every single day?""

""See if I don't!""

""And bring me back the minute Beth is well?""

""The identical minute.""

""And go to the theater, truly?""

""A dozen theaters, if we may.""

""Well—I guess I will,"" said Amy slowly.

""Good girl! Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in,"" said Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the 'giving in'.

Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

""How is the little dear?"" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.

""She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety,"" answered Meg.

""What a trying world it is!"" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. ""No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea.""

""Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?"" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend's one beauty.

""That is what troubles me,"" said Meg. ""I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me.""

""Hum, well, I can't say. Suppose you ask Grandfather after the doctor has been.""

""We will. Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once,"" commanded Meg. ""We can't decide anything till he has been.""

""Stay where you are, Jo. I'm errand boy to this establishment,"" said Laurie, taking up his cap.

""I'm afraid you are busy,"" began Meg.

""No, I've done my lessons for the day.""

""Do you study in vacation time?"" asked Jo.

""I follow the good example my neighbors set me,"" was Laurie's answer, as he swung himself out of the room.

""I have great hopes for my boy,"" observed Jo, watching him fly over the fence with an approving smile.

""He does very well, for a boy,"" was Meg's somewhat ungracious answer, for the subject did not interest her.

Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story. Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.

Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.

""What do you want now?"" she asked, looking sharply over her spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair, called out...

""Go away. No boys allowed here.""

Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.

""No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking about among poor folks. Amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn't sick, which I've no doubt she will be, looks like it now. Don't cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff.""

Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the parrot's tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and call out, ""Bless my boots!"" in such a funny way, that she laughed instead.

""What do you hear from your mother?"" asked the old lady gruffly.

""Father is much better,"" replied Jo, trying to keep sober.

""Oh, is he? Well, that won't last long, I fancy. March never had any stamina,"" was the cheerful reply.

""Ha, ha! Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!"" squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.

""Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird! And, Jo, you'd better go at once. It isn't proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like...""

""Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!"" cried Polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the 'rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.

""I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try,"" thought Amy, as she was left alone with Aunt March.

""Get along, you fright!"" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech Amy could not restrain a sniff.",Louisa May Alcott,1963,"[85, 76, 74, 68, 79, 87]",6

662,Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart,"Dear, when you smile at me
I hear a melody
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me
Started a symphony
Zing went the strings of my heart

Whoa now the breath of spring
Whoa I heard a robin sing
About a nest... apart
All that you seem to be
End up in harmony
Zing went the strings of my heart

I still recall the thrill
I guess I always will
I hope we'll never depart
Dear, with your lips to mine
A rhapsody divine
Zing went the strings of my heart
Zing went the strings of my heart

Oh, solo Dio sa, troverò lavoro nell'aldilà

[Strofa 1: Wayne Santana]
Sto correndo veloce come una gazzella
Ho le guardie dietro, ho detto: ""Tony accelera""
Fottute guardie, fottuta cella
Ho una canna d’erba da due grammi accesa
Passala a noi oppure passala a Sfera
Passala a IZI, a Rkomi oppure a Tedua
Da Roma a Napoli, da Milano a Genova
Mando un bacio a mia madre Carmela
Cuoricini ai fratelli che stanno in galera
Mezza birra va a voi, la versiamo per terra
Non parlare se non sai un cazzo della faccenda
Questi mi vogliono dentro come Gucci o Mandela
Una collana gialla, sembra Lisa Simpson
Una faccia di Cristo, sembra Mel Gibson
Noi siamo o’ Track, tu Malammore
La nuova scissione, sai come finisce

[Strofa 2: Enzo Dong]
La mia vita tarantella tipo Tarantino
Tutte sere nere, io qua la sera rapino
Dimmi dove ognuno nasce giudicato
Dimmi dove, come, quando che poi ti rovino
Voglio vino Tavernello tipo rabbino
Saltate tra i palazzi con un rampino
Salutate i miei ragazzi con una biro
Sì caro, siamo i sicari sigari cubani fregati a Capodichino
Se, quale ferro? Se di ferro c’hai solo il disco di Tiziano Ferro
Fanculo alla tua cazzo di gang bang
Che dopo due Tennent's
M’arriva e mi ripete gang, gang, ga-ga-gang (ma c' vuò?)
Come la mettiamo, si vede
Che io lo faccio come si deve
Arrivo con la Polo Gang
E. Dong addio rapper
Rock'n'roll, Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Strofa 3: Tony Effe]
Non andrò mai in galera
Con la gang da quand'ero sperma
Passo giù a Secondigliano e torno gonfio in centro
Fumo così tanta erba che mi scambi per un negro
Lucciole sul collo, può vedermi anche un cieco
Quando passo c'è il sole, il mio pendente è una torcia
Come a Napoli nei boxer la pistola
La tua ragazza mi vuole al compleanno per torta
Mi vede entrare e dopo diventa tutta rossa
Facciamo soldi, morti, proprio come a Napoli
Fuori tutti quanti i ragazzi dalle carceri (liberi)

It is just not the same

Back in the days when I worked at the Days Inn
Your daddy you hated said I'll never make it
Now I'm making payments, now you make a paycheck
Now look who's impatient
And tables you waitin'
I tried to tell'em but they never listened
So now when they call me, I tell them I missed it
I don't need provisions
I don't need permission
And now that I'm winning
They all see the vision

You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember

I'm thankful for lessons you taught me 'bout life
And the way that these women work
It was never 'bout love
If it was then the rest of my life would be spent with her
When I come in town
Oh, she down I'm around
Boy, you might get your feelings hurt
She don't fucking care 'bout the love that you share
All the flowers you sent to her
They switch it up when they seen it you up
When they see what you've done
And how far that you've come
Act like the friendship is something it isn't
They start acting different, I know what they want
My ex is my ex for a reason
The team is for maybe next season
At least you had me to believe it
Let that sink in

You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember
You've been forgiven
I will not forget it
Said it I made it
Always remember",Baby E,1963,[91],1

Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour

And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be

All I have left is a heart full of sorrow since she said she'd never forgive

The house that we've built was once filled with laughter
But I changed that laughter to tears
And now I live in a world without sunshine
Oh how I wish you were here

Shutters and boards cover the windows...

Last night I dreamed that you came to our house
To take an old book from the shelf
If you'll open the shutters I'll tear down the boards
Cause I drove every nail by myself

Shutters and boards cover the windows...

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

Got everybody thinking I'm half smart

Got a new vocabulary
Even got a new canary

Same old hurt stays the same
Always there reminding me that we're apart

Got a new wallet full of money
Got a new girl that calls me 'Honey'

There's no splendor in the darkness of night
When there's no loving arms to hold you tight

Mmm give a little back
Of what you've been taking
Better start being for real and stop your faking
You better prepare yourself for that rainy day
You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way

You're gonna need me
Need me one day
You're gonna want me back in your arms

Tell me who's gonna take the heartbreak i took
And still be there at the close of the book
When you've grown older and lost your way
And all your rainbows have turned to gray

You better throw a little tenderness and affection my way",Dionne Warwick,1963,"[77, 65, 65]",3
707,Little Tin Soldier,"Little tin soldier they gave you an innocent gun
And then they welded your hand in place
And then they put black paint in your eyes
They made you smaller than life-size
And they threw rocks at you
And chipped your pretty coat
When they knew you had to wear that coat forever
Little tin soldier they neglected to give you a tongue
They fixed your legs so you could not run
And then they put you in boxes and sold you
None of them ever wanted to hold you
They just set fire to you
And singed your gallant plume
And they made you lie in boxes all together
And from the tiny dark glass
Of all those tiny prisons

I can hear tin soldiers singing
With the silence of their fears
Let it not rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Let it not rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
I can hear tin soldiers singing
With the silence of their fears
Don't let it rain tomorrow
So they will stay outdoors
Don't let it rain tomorrow

There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me, I don't care
You see so what if I bleed
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real

My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how

710,Monsters' Holiday,"It was the night before Christmas when all through the castle
My monsters were having a Yuletide hassle
The tree was all trimmed in ghoulish things
Like werewolf fangs and vampire wings
(It was a monsters' holiday)
But they were up to no good
(It was a monsters' holiday)
Didn't act like good monsters should
(It was a monsters' holiday)
They found themselves a new play
(It was a monsters' holiday)
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh
They were making a list and checking it twice
Frankenstein wanted a shiny new trike
A new chain for Yarnush
A brace for Igor's back
A speed shaver for Wolfman
A new cape for Drak
(It was a monsters' holiday)
But they were up to no good
(It was a monsters' holiday)
Didn't act like good monster's should
(It was a monsters' holiday)
They found themselves a new play
(It was a monsters' holiday)
They planned to rob Santa's sleigh
The Mummy was to signal from the castle roof
At the very first sound of a reindeer hoof
As Santa slid down the chimney wall
The zombies were to make off with sleigh and all
From beyond the moat, there arose such a clatter
I jumped to the window to see what was the matter
Like a bolt of lightning, it happened so quick
And there in our midst stood old Saint Nick
He began to dig down deep in his sack
And came up with the traction for Igor's back
Drak got his cape
Franky's trike made him behave
Even Wolfman was happy, now he can shave
(It was a monsters' holiday)
And all ended well
(It was a monsters' holiday)
And Santa was really swell
(It was a monsters' holiday)
No need to rob Santa's sleigh
(It was a monsters' holiday)
Maybe next year he'll come back
So the children everywhere were spared the grief
Of losing their presents to a monster sleigh thief
Now the monsters love Santa and say they'll behave
And never again rob sleighs or graves
(It was a monsters' holiday!)
Igor, what do you think of Santa now?
""Arrrrrr, Santa good!""
And Santa said as he drove out of sight
""Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!""
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-wolf open sleigh
Dashing through the snow
Where is that reindeer with the red nose
On Dasher and Dancer and Comet and Cupid",Bobby “Boris” Pickett,1963,"[39, 30]",2
711,Ride!,"[Verse 1]
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize (Size, size)

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

[Verse 2]
""I'd die for you,"" that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talkin' to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

[Chorus]
Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'
So I'm takin' my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride

So I'm takin' my time
Takin' my time on my ride, woah-oh-oh (Wuh, yeah)

Saiba que isso em mim provoca imensa dor
Só privilegiados têm ouvido igual ao seu
Eu possuo apenas o que Deus me deu
Se você insiste em classificar
Meu comportamento de anti-musical
Eu mesmo mentindo devo argumentar
Que isto é bossa-nova, que isto é muito natural
O que você não sabe nem sequer pressente
É que os desafinados também têm um coração

Fotografei você na minha Roleiflex
Revelou-se a sua enorme ingratidão
Só não poderá falar assim do meu amor
Que ele é o maior que você pode encontrar, viu
Você com a sua música esqueceu o principal
Que no peito dos desafinados
No fundo do peito bate calado
Que no peito dos desafinados
Também bate um coração",João Gilberto,1963,"[50, 41]",2

Well it's trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my worried mind
When you see me laughin'
I'm laughin' just to keep from cryin'",Nina Simone,1963,"[86, 93]",2
718,Big Boat,"Well, he says he's got a big boat
A high roller
And everybody knows its name
Oh, it's a big boat and it pumps up the poor boys pride
Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride

Says he's got a big boat
A wide load
Enough to bring the party down
Oh yeah a big boat
It ain't no carnival cruise
Says he's got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat, enough to fit an extra one or two

Says he's got a big boat, but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride

Says he's got a fast boat, talk about high speed
But everybody knows the truth
Oh hey, a big boat
Get your oars back in the water, kid
Says he's got a fast boat, but it's just a fairy boat it ain't to faster than a goldfish

Says he got a big boat but it's just a fairy boat and that makes for a short, short ride",M. Ward,1963,[93],1
719,Someone Somewhere,"[Chorus]
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

[Verse 1]
It was you
That told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And how you sang with the band in Memphis
It's hard just to be strong
Not knowing if I've done you proud
I like to imagine
You smile when you hear my songs

[Chorus]
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

[Verse 2]
A letter home
And I know we don't speak much
And we both know I'm not keen to
But I think there's things I've left unsaid
I'm okay, don't worry
I wish I'd been a better kid
I'm trying to slow down
I'm sorry for letting you down

[Chorus]
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You know it's just rock and roll
I know you're by my side through it all
My terror twin and I
Let's take over the world

[Chorus]
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own
Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
Because I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home, sweet home
To call my own",Asking Alexandria,1963,[95],1

721,Rumors,"[Verse 1]
She's got some nice long hair
And you know that she's a bad chick
All the boys stare
Can't help it it's a habit
Clothes that she wears
Short skirt and a jacket
I just wanna get her all alone
On a mattress
I just wanna have it
I just gotta have it
Rumors all around say her body is fantastic
All natural, not a piece of her is plastic
Head to her toes yea they say that she's elastic
Yea the whispers all around say she has a reputation
Don't believe it 'till I see it so I want a demonstration
And I've always learned it better with a hands on education
So I need a private session if you get what I am saying
And they say that she's not easy no she's really complicated
But that only makes it better and it's got me so fixated
And I'm not the type to wait around I've never hesitated
But shes got me captivated so the game I'm gonna play it yea

[Chorus]
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I heard you look good in a sundress
I heard you look good when you're undressed
I heard you like to get away
I heard you like to stay out late
I heard you had a couple boyfriends
I heard they didn't treat you right
I heard you're hated by your girlfriends
Cause all the guys want you tonight
They say she's too hot they say she's too cold
Where she came from nobody really knows
They say she looks young but say she acts old
From everything I've heard she gets out of control
And all the boys say she was sent from the heavens
But I'm not too sure that this girl is a blessing
She's got the devils eyes and they'll cut you like a weapon
She's stuck in my mind like a bad obsession
Got bad intentions

[Chorus]
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me

She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
She's got a body like a coke fiend
She likes to keep the party going
These rumors got me feeling lonely
I want that body baby show me
I want that body baby show me",NEFFEX,1963,[38],1
722,The Push And Kick,"[Intro]

[Verse 1: Young Focus]
My thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
Or better yet a volcano
My cup runneth over with heart
That's word to Kano
And I'll disown yoa with a blade like its nemesis
Cuz I got good riddance like bad dinner guests
That's bout to leave
Which means I can freestyle
But give me a pen and a pad
I show you he wild
Give you some advice on some friends shit
Me and rap was born to be together
On some Siamese twin shit
Gotcha chick on that I don't wanna be friends shit
Took her to the crib and I opened up her legs
I was like, hello kitty on some Japanese film shit
Daddy was a hustler
Look at how the brim sit
They on they New Era's and the sneakers
I'm in a new area of the lab, with the beakers
Mad scientist flow
Sociopath
I'm feeling like raps granny panties
I cover most of yo ass
You don't get a pass
I'm shy, nigga I never lie
When you spit you turn the camera guy into a samurai
They like what you mean nigga
I mean when you rap they cut the tape like a marathon winner
I curse you niggas thinner
I give a little bit
They wanna see more, Skinner
You fucking with a winner
I'm 7+2, I go the whole 9
They half ass, like sagging
I ain't trying brag, I'm that rad
On fire like American flag, in Baghdad
I'm making rappers retire
Like a fixing a flat
Uh, and they say we spit the Coca-Cola
Haters know I'm on point like an areola
No homo, you dudes think inside the box like hobo
While I drive like Volvo
Chicks treat my dick like an oboe
Plus I never bend like elbow
That's a no go
Like red lights
They read your rights
Get your ticket
With me you can't kick it
Now I got you feeling out of place like evicted
I gotta question for you
Where you gonna live?
All you do is take dog
When you gonna give?
You lame
But me, I'm like Larenz Tate up in Waist Deep
I drop jewels and give em' back to the game
Now ain't that a shame
On some Fats Domino shit
You'll never be on top
On some sex with fat ho shit
This fresh prince never giving in
Spit what they can no longer feel
Like the dark skinned Vivian
I'm in again and I'm coming for your saving
So holler at ya boy like ya sons misbehaving

723,He's A Rebel,"See the way he walks down the street
Watch the way he shuffles his feet
My, he holds his head up high
When he goes walking by
He's my guy

When he holds my hand, I'm so proud
'Cause he's not just one of the crowd
Why is he always the one
To try the things they've never done?
Just because of that, they say:

""He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should""
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why I can't give him all my love
He's always good to me
Always treats me tenderly
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me

If they don't like him that way
They won't like me, I'm sure, today
I'll be standing right by his side
When they say:

""He's a rebel and he'll never ever be any good
He's a rebel 'cause he never ever ever does what he should""
But just because he doesn't do what everybody else does
That's no reason why we can't share love
He's always good to me
Good to him, I'll try to be
'Cause he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no, to me

Oh he's not a rebel, no, no, no
He's not a rebel, no, no, no",The Crystals,1963,[52],1
724,All Alone Am I,"[Chorus]
All alone am I, ever since your goodbye
All alone, with just a beat of my heart
People all around, but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating, of my heart

[Verse 1]
No use in holding other hands!
For I'd be holding, only emptiness
No use in kissing other lips
For I'd be thinking, just of your caress

[Chorus]
All alone am I, ever since your goodbye
All alone, with just a beat of my heart
People all around, but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating, of my heart

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
No other voice can say the words!
My heart must hear to ever sing again
The words you used to whisper low!
No other love can ev'r bring again

[Chorus]
All alone am I, ever since your goodbye
All alone, with just a beat of my heart
People all around, but I don't hear a sound
Just the lonely beating; of my heart! ...",Alison Krauss,1963,[60],1
725,Spanish Lace,"Spanish lace, and memories
Reminds me of the girl I love
Spanish lace, and memories
These are the things I dream of
Her eyes were as dark as the night with no stars
Her love for me was shining in her face
The whole world seemed aglow as my arms reached and found her
My love surrounded me with Spanish lace

And one day, when I'm through ramblin'
I'll get tired of a chase
And I'll go back to my sweetheart
And fall in love again with Spanish lace
Her eyes were as dark as the night with no stars
Her love for me was shining in her face
The whole world seemed aglow as my arms reached and found her
My love surrounded me with Spanish lace
Oh, my love surrounded me with Spanish lace",Howard Crockett,1963,[62],1
726,I May Not Live To See Tomorrow,"If I can see this one night through
Maybe I'll get over you
And realize our love was never right

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

If I'm around when daylight breaks
I may find the strength it takes
To love again and make things
Come out right

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

I tell myself tomorrow's
Gonna be a better day
But tomorrow seems to be
A century away

If I survive the morning dew
Maybe I'll find someone new
And start again to build
A brand new life

But I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight

No, I may not live to see tomorrow
I may die of a broken heart tonight",Brian Hyland,1963,[69],1
727,Me And My Shadow,"[Hook - Mads]
Used to hate wakin' up in the morning
Up late, tried escapin' the moment
Other day I wasn't up when alarm rang
That's a plane I never showed up for boarding

[Verse 1 - Mads]
But
What is that in the distance?
Another cloud in your vision
Another trial with no assistance
But you gotta try to just flip this
Sunshine ain't a rental
A grey sky got potential
A great life is all mental
Not to mention the nettle ain't perennial
Yeah, I know you're feeling the burn
And everywhere you turn
There's another wrong that emerge
Yeah, it's awful, it hurts
Stay strong and up surge
There's no bomb, nor a plum or a palm
The calm thoughts belong in the dirt
So I ain't concerned, you gon' get what you deserve
But first, you gotta put in that work
You cannot mourn and then purge, fuck that!
Life's a never ending search for the glow in the blur

[Chorus - Breana Marin]
Sometimes I wish there was a pill to help my heart (Mads: Just me and my shadow)
Or maybe a Band-Aid that could cover up these scars  (Mads: Just me and my shadow)
But nothing is ever, strong, enough  (Mads: Me and my shadow)
And nothing is ever, good, enough, no (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my, shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Just me and my, shadow)

[Verse 2 - Mads]
Yo, I know you're trying to stay positive
I know you're trying to stay confident
I know you're trying to stay dominant
In a world that is vomitive, they probably turnin' you the opposite
You gotta filter out the bullshit
I'm feelin' realer when the moon's lit
Not dealin' with the humans, not suited for the foolish, gotta stay booted to the fullest
And it's proven
That the kids who ain't the cutest, are the kids who ain't included
Findin' peace up in their music
And I'm speakin' for the wounded, they are seeking someone truer, than a preacher full of rumors, tryna see into the future
But I ain't tryin' to be just another one, thinkin' I'm wicked and
Flippin' lines with no undertone
Oh right, 'head of my time, yep, shadow
The further you walk away from the light and the safezone

[Chorus - Breana Marin]
Sometimes I wish there was a pill to help my heart (Mads: Just me and my shadow)
Or maybe a Band-Aid that could cover up these scars  (Mads: Just me and my shadow)
But nothing is ever, strong, enough  (Mads: Me and my shadow)
And nothing is ever, good, enough, no (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my, shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Me and my shadow)
Oh (Mads: Just me and my, shadow)

[Hook - Mads]
I used to hate wakin' up in the morning
Stayed up late, tried escapin' the moment
Other day I wasn't up when alarm rang
That's a plane, I never showed up for boarding (shadow)

[Verse 3 - Mads]
My pain, no one saw, I was storing
Sorry I was absorbing, rain inside, it was pouring
I was holding in stories, wanted to go with no warning
I was blaming, not solving, straight frozen in fallin'
Blind-folded and crawling, mind closin' the coffin
Mind-blowin' distortions, fright pausing emotions
I chose to be hopeless, sight broken and poison
Yeah, tried to eat me alive, but I'm a snowman
I'm kinda callow
Livin' to ride home
Nothin' inside, no
When everything's hollow
But I never stop, no
Miracle, I glow
Somethin' to follow
Me and my shadow
I'm kinda callow
Livin' to ride home
Nothin' inside, no
When everything's hollow
But I never stop, no
Miracle, I glow
Somethin' to follow
Me and my shadow

[Outro - Mads]
Just me and my shadow (uh)
Me and my shadow

728,Rainbow At Midnight,"Tonight love without warning
Stole right into this room
And amazed me like morning
Cause the night is far from over
But the light is shining through

And there's a rainbow at midnight
And the faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you

You can live life without dreaming
Or your dreams never come true
But to save me that worry
With a dream to keep believing
When the rest have fallen through

And there's a rainbow at midnight
And the faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you

Heaven is saying
This time love won't leave you
Never be afraid or blue

There's a rainbow at midnight
There's a faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you

There's a rainbow at midnight
There's a faint glow won't loose
There's a rainbow at midnight
Shining all the way from here to you",The Oak Ridge Boys,1963,[77],1

730,Sam's Song,"In western lands beneath the Sun
the flowers may rise in Spring,
the trees may bud, the waters run,
the merry finches sing.
Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night
and swaying beeches bear
the Elven-stars as jewels white
amid their branching hair.
Though here at journey's end I lie
in darkness buried deep,
beyond all towers strong and high,
beyond all mountains steep,
above all shadows rides the Sun
and Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
nor bid the Stars farewell.",J. R. R. Tolkien,1963,[96],1
731,The (Bossa Nova) Bird,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder
What this old world's comin' to

Down on main street baby
Where the band will play all night long
They play some hot rock 'n' roll to fine syncopation

We're gonna make this weekend last forever

We'll get home in the morning
While the milk man's calling
And the early birds start to sing
I will roll you some breakfast
And we'll jump into bed
And we'll start all over again
So hang on tight baby
We'll go flyin'
Give your man a big kiss
We're gonna boogie on down
From the Bronx to Manhattan
Memories are made of this

We're goin' out dancin'
We're goin' out dancin'
