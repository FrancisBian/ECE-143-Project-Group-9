Someday we'll be together

1,Leaving On A Jet Plane,"[Verse 1]
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go
I'm standing here outside your door
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 2]
There's so many times I let you down
So many times I've played around
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing
Every place I go, I'll think of you
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

[Chorus]
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Verse 3]
Now the time has come to leave you
One more time, let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

[Chorus]
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go

[Outro]
I'm leaving on a jet plane
Don't know when I'll be back again
Oh babe, I hate to go",John Denver,1969,"[2, 1, 2, 2, 7, 12, 23, 39, 57, 76]",10
2,Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head,"Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothin' seems to fit
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head, they keep fallin'

But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin' me

It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red
Cryin's not for me
'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free
Nothing's worryin'

3,Down On The Corner/Fortunate Son,"Yesterday afternoon set in misty and cold. I had half a mind to spend it by my study fire, instead of wading through heath and mud to Wuthering Heights. On coming up from dinner, however, (N.B.—I dine between twelve and one o’clock; the housekeeper, a matronly lady, taken as a fixture along with the house, could not, or would not, comprehend my request that I might be served at five)—on mounting the stairs with this lazy intention, and stepping into the room, I saw a servant-girl on her knees surrounded by brushes and coal-scuttles, and raising an infernal dust as she extinguished the flames with heaps of cinders. This spectacle drove me back immediately; I took my hat, and, after a four-miles’ walk, arrived at Heathcliff’s garden-gate just in time to escape the first feathery flakes of a snow-shower.

On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air made me shiver through every limb. Being unable to remove the chain, I jumped over, and, running up the flagged causeway bordered with straggling gooseberry-bushes, knocked vainly for admittance, till my knuckles tingled and the dogs howled.

‘Wretched inmates!’ I ejaculated, mentally, ‘you deserve perpetual isolation from your species for your churlish inhospitality. At least, I would not keep my doors barred in the day-time. I don’t care—I will get in!’ So resolved, I grasped the latch and shook it vehemently. Vinegar-faced Joseph projected his head from a round window of the barn.

‘What are ye for?’ he shouted. ‘T’ maister’s down i’ t’ fowld. Go round by th’ end o’ t’ laith, if ye went to spake to him.’

‘Is there nobody inside to open the door?’ I hallooed, responsively.

‘There’s nobbut t’ missis; and shoo’ll not oppen ’t an ye mak’ yer flaysome dins till neeght.’

‘Why? Cannot you tell her whom I am, eh, Joseph?’

‘Nor-ne me! I’ll hae no hend wi’t,’ muttered the head, vanishing.

The snow began to drive thickly. I seized the handle to essay another trial; when a young man without coat, and shouldering a pitchfork, appeared in the yard behind. He hailed me to follow him, and, after marching through a wash-house, and a paved area containing a coal-shed, pump, and pigeon-cot, we at length arrived in the huge, warm, cheerful apartment where I was formerly received. It glowed delightfully in the radiance of an immense fire, compounded of coal, peat, and wood; and near the table, laid for a plentiful evening meal, I was pleased to observe the ‘missis,’ an individual whose existence I had never previously suspected. I bowed and waited, thinking she would bid me take a seat. She looked at me, leaning back in her chair, and remained motionless and mute.

‘Rough weather!’ I remarked. ‘I’m afraid, Mrs. Heathcliff, the door must bear the consequence of your servants’ leisure attendance: I had hard work to make them hear me.’

She never opened her mouth. I stared—she stared also: at any rate, she kept her eyes on me in a cool, regardless manner, exceedingly embarrassing and disagreeable.

‘Sit down,’ said the young man, gruffly. ‘He’ll be in soon.’

I obeyed; and hemmed, and called the villain Juno, who deigned, at this second interview, to move the extreme tip of her tail, in token of owning my acquaintance.

‘A beautiful animal!’ I commenced again. ‘Do you intend parting with the little ones, madam?’

‘They are not mine,’ said the amiable hostess, more repellingly than Heathcliff himself could have replied.

‘Ah, your favourites are among these?’ I continued, turning to an obscure cushion full of something like cats.

‘A strange choice of favourites!’ she observed scornfully.

Unluckily, it was a heap of dead rabbits. I hemmed once more, and drew closer to the hearth, repeating my comment on the wildness of the evening.

‘You should not have come out,’ she said, rising and reaching from the chimney-piece two of the painted canisters.

Her position before was sheltered from the light; now, I had a distinct view of her whole figure and countenance. She was slender, and apparently scarcely past girlhood: an admirable form, and the most exquisite little face that I have ever had the pleasure of beholding; small features, very fair; flaxen ringlets, or rather golden, hanging loose on her delicate neck; and eyes, had they been agreeable in expression, that would have been irresistible: fortunately for my susceptible heart, the only sentiment they evinced hovered between scorn and a kind of desperation, singularly unnatural to be detected there. The canisters were almost out of her reach; I made a motion to aid her; she turned upon me as a miser might turn if any one attempted to assist him in counting his gold.

‘I don’t want your help,’ she snapped; ‘I can get them for myself.’

‘I beg your pardon!’ I hastened to reply.

‘Were you asked to tea?’ she demanded, tying an apron over her neat black frock, and standing with a spoonful of the leaf poised over the pot.

‘I shall be glad to have a cup,’ I answered.

‘Were you asked?’ she repeated.

‘No,’ I said, half smiling. ‘You are the proper person to ask me.’

She flung the tea back, spoon and all, and resumed her chair in a pet; her forehead corrugated, and her red under-lip pushed out, like a child’s ready to cry.

Meanwhile, the young man had slung on to his person a decidedly shabby upper garment, and, erecting himself before the blaze, looked down on me from the corner of his eyes, for all the world as if there were some mortal feud unavenged between us. I began to doubt whether he were a servant or not: his dress and speech were both rude, entirely devoid of the superiority observable in Mr. and Mrs. Heathcliff; his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated, his whiskers encroached bearishly over his cheeks, and his hands were embrowned like those of a common labourer: still his bearing was free, almost haughty, and he showed none of a domestic’s assiduity in attending on the lady of the house. In the absence of clear proofs of his condition, I deemed it best to abstain from noticing his curious conduct; and, five minutes afterwards, the entrance of Heathcliff relieved me, in some measure, from my uncomfortable state.

‘You see, sir, I am come, according to promise!’ I exclaimed, assuming the cheerful; ‘and I fear I shall be weather-bound for half an hour, if you can afford me shelter during that space.’

‘Half an hour?’ he said, shaking the white flakes from his clothes; ‘I wonder you should select the thick of a snow-storm to ramble about in. Do you know that you run a risk of being lost in the marshes? People familiar with these moors often miss their road on such evenings; and I can tell you there is no chance of a change at present.’

‘Perhaps I can get a guide among your lads, and he might stay at the Grange till morning—could you spare me one?’

‘No, I could not.’

‘Oh, indeed! Well, then, I must trust to my own sagacity.’

‘Umph!’

‘Are you going to mak’ the tea?’ demanded he of the shabby coat, shifting his ferocious gaze from me to the young lady.

‘Is he to have any?’ she asked, appealing to Heathcliff.

‘Get it ready, will you?’ was the answer, uttered so savagely that I started. The tone in which the words were said revealed a genuine bad nature. I no longer felt inclined to call Heathcliff a capital fellow. When the preparations were finished, he invited me with—‘Now, sir, bring forward your chair.’ And we all, including the rustic youth, drew round the table: an austere silence prevailing while we discussed our meal.

I thought, if I had caused the cloud, it was my duty to make an effort to dispel it. They could not every day sit so grim and taciturn; and it was impossible, however ill-tempered they might be, that the universal scowl they wore was their every-day countenance.

‘It is strange,’ I began, in the interval of swallowing one cup of tea and receiving another—‘it is strange how custom can mould our tastes and ideas: many could not imagine the existence of happiness in a life of such complete exile from the world as you spend, Mr. Heathcliff; yet, I’ll venture to say, that, surrounded by your family, and with your amiable lady as the presiding genius over your home and heart—’

‘My amiable lady!’ he interrupted, with an almost diabolical sneer on his face. ‘Where is she—my amiable lady?’

‘Mrs. Heathcliff, your wife, I mean.’

‘Well, yes—oh, you would intimate that her spirit has taken the post of ministering angel, and guards the fortunes of Wuthering Heights, even when her body is gone. Is that it?’

Perceiving myself in a blunder, I attempted to correct it. I might have seen there was too great a disparity between the ages of the parties to make it likely that they were man and wife. One was about forty: a period of mental vigour at which men seldom cherish the delusion of being married for love by girls: that dream is reserved for the solace of our declining years. The other did not look seventeen.

Then it flashed upon me—‘The clown at my elbow, who is drinking his tea out of a basin and eating his bread with unwashed hands, may be her husband: Heathcliff junior, of course. Here is the consequence of being buried alive: she has thrown herself away upon that boor from sheer ignorance that better individuals existed! A sad pity—I must beware how I cause her to regret her choice.’ The last reflection may seem conceited; it was not. My neighbour struck me as bordering on repulsive; I knew, through experience, that I was tolerably attractive.

‘Mrs. Heathcliff is my daughter-in-law,’ said Heathcliff, corroborating my surmise. He turned, as he spoke, a peculiar look in her direction: a look of hatred; unless he has a most perverse set of facial muscles that will not, like those of other people, interpret the language of his soul.

‘Ah, certainly—I see now: you are the favoured possessor of the beneficent fairy,’ I remarked, turning to my neighbour.

This was worse than before: the youth grew crimson, and clenched his fist, with every appearance of a meditated assault. But he seemed to recollect himself presently, and smothered the storm in a brutal curse, muttered on my behalf: which, however, I took care not to notice.

‘Unhappy in your conjectures, sir,’ observed my host; ‘we neither of us have the privilege of owning your good fairy; her mate is dead. I said she was my daughter-in-law: therefore, she must have married my son.’

‘And this young man is—’

‘Not my son, assuredly.’

Heathcliff smiled again, as if it were rather too bold a jest to attribute the paternity of that bear to him.

‘My name is Hareton Earnshaw,’ growled the other; ‘and I’d counsel you to respect it!’

‘I’ve shown no disrespect,’ was my reply, laughing internally at the dignity with which he announced himself.

He fixed his eye on me longer than I cared to return the stare, for fear I might be tempted either to box his ears or render my hilarity audible. I began to feel unmistakably out of place in that pleasant family circle. The dismal spiritual atmosphere overcame, and more than neutralised, the glowing physical comforts round me; and I resolved to be cautious how I ventured under those rafters a third time.

The business of eating being concluded, and no one uttering a word of sociable conversation, I approached a window to examine the weather. A sorrowful sight I saw: dark night coming down prematurely, and sky and hills mingled in one bitter whirl of wind and suffocating snow.

‘I don’t think it possible for me to get home now without a guide,’ I could not help exclaiming. ‘The roads will be buried already; and, if they were bare, I could scarcely distinguish a foot in advance.’

‘Hareton, drive those dozen sheep into the barn porch. They’ll be covered if left in the fold all night: and put a plank before them,’ said Heathcliff.

‘How must I do?’ I continued, with rising irritation.

There was no reply to my question; and on looking round I saw only Joseph bringing in a pail of porridge for the dogs, and Mrs. Heathcliff leaning over the fire, diverting herself with burning a bundle of matches which had fallen from the chimney-piece as she restored the tea-canister to its place. The former, when he had deposited his burden, took a critical survey of the room, and in cracked tones grated out—‘Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i’ idleness un war, when all on ’ems goan out! Bud yah’re a nowt, and it’s no use talking—yah’ll niver mend o’yer ill ways, but goa raight to t’ divil, like yer mother afore ye!’

I imagined, for a moment, that this piece of eloquence was addressed to me; and, sufficiently enraged, stepped towards the aged rascal with an intention of kicking him out of the door. Mrs. Heathcliff, however, checked me by her answer.

‘You scandalous old hypocrite!’ she replied. ‘Are you not afraid of being carried away bodily, whenever you mention the devil’s name? I warn you to refrain from provoking me, or I’ll ask your abduction as a special favour! Stop! look here, Joseph,’ she continued, taking a long, dark book from a shelf; ‘I’ll show you how far I’ve progressed in the Black Art: I shall soon be competent to make a clear house of it. The red cow didn’t die by chance; and your rheumatism can hardly be reckoned among providential visitations!’

‘Oh, wicked, wicked!’ gasped the elder; ‘may the Lord deliver us from evil!’

‘No, reprobate! you are a castaway—be off, or I’ll hurt you seriously! I’ll have you all modelled in wax and clay! and the first who passes the limits I fix shall—I’ll not say what he shall be done to—but, you’ll see! Go, I’m looking at you!’

The little witch put a mock malignity into her beautiful eyes, and Joseph, trembling with sincere horror, hurried out, praying, and ejaculating ‘wicked’ as he went. I thought her conduct must be prompted by a species of dreary fun; and, now that we were alone, I endeavoured to interest her in my distress.

‘Mrs. Heathcliff,’ I said earnestly, ‘you must excuse me for troubling you. I presume, because, with that face, I’m sure you cannot help being good-hearted. Do point out some landmarks by which I may know my way home: I have no more idea how to get there than you would have how to get to London!’

‘Take the road you came,’ she answered, ensconcing herself in a chair, with a candle, and the long book open before her. ‘It is brief advice, but as sound as I can give.’

‘Then, if you hear of me being discovered dead in a bog or a pit full of snow, your conscience won’t whisper that it is partly your fault?’

‘How so? I cannot escort you. They wouldn’t let me go to the end of the garden wall.’

‘You! I should be sorry to ask you to cross the threshold, for my convenience, on such a night,’ I cried. ‘I want you to tell me my way, not to show it: or else to persuade Mr. Heathcliff to give me a guide.’

‘Who? There is himself, Earnshaw, Zillah, Joseph and I. Which would you have?’

‘Are there no boys at the farm?’

‘No; those are all.’

‘Then, it follows that I am compelled to stay.’

‘That you may settle with your host. I have nothing to do with it.’

‘I hope it will be a lesson to you to make no more rash journeys on these hills,’ cried Heathcliff’s stern voice from the kitchen entrance. ‘As to staying here, I don’t keep accommodations for visitors: you must share a bed with Hareton or Joseph, if you do.’

‘I can sleep on a chair in this room,’ I replied.

‘No, no! A stranger is a stranger, be he rich or poor: it will not suit me to permit any one the range of the place while I am off guard!’ said the unmannerly wretch.

With this insult my patience was at an end. I uttered an expression of disgust, and pushed past him into the yard, running against Earnshaw in my haste. It was so dark that I could not see the means of exit; and, as I wandered round, I heard another specimen of their civil behaviour amongst each other. At first the young man appeared about to befriend me.

‘I’ll go with him as far as the park,’ he said.

‘You’ll go with him to hell!’ exclaimed his master, or whatever relation he bore. ‘And who is to look after the horses, eh?’

‘A man’s life is of more consequence than one evening’s neglect of the horses: somebody must go,’ murmured Mrs. Heathcliff, more kindly than I expected.

‘Not at your command!’ retorted Hareton. ‘If you set store on him, you’d better be quiet.’

‘Then I hope his ghost will haunt you; and I hope Mr. Heathcliff will never get another tenant till the Grange is a ruin,’ she answered, sharply.

‘Hearken, hearken, shoo’s cursing on ’em!’ muttered Joseph, towards whom I had been steering.

He sat within earshot, milking the cows by the light of a lantern, which I seized unceremoniously, and, calling out that I would send it back on the morrow, rushed to the nearest postern.

‘Maister, maister, he’s staling t’ lanthern!’ shouted the ancient, pursuing my retreat. ‘Hey, Gnasher! Hey, dog! Hey Wolf, holld him, holld him!’

On opening the little door, two hairy monsters flew at my throat, bearing me down, and extinguishing the light; while a mingled guffaw from Heathcliff and Hareton put the copestone on my rage and humiliation. Fortunately, the beasts seemed more bent on stretching their paws, and yawning, and flourishing their tails, than devouring me alive; but they would suffer no resurrection, and I was forced to lie till their malignant masters pleased to deliver me: then, hatless and trembling with wrath, I ordered the miscreants to let me out—on their peril to keep me one minute longer—with several incoherent threats of retaliation that, in their indefinite depth of virulency, smacked of King Lear.

The vehemence of my agitation brought on a copious bleeding at the nose, and still Heathcliff laughed, and still I scolded. I don’t know what would have concluded the scene, had there not been one person at hand rather more rational than myself, and more benevolent than my entertainer. This was Zillah, the stout housewife; who at length issued forth to inquire into the nature of the uproar. She thought that some of them had been laying violent hands on me; and, not daring to attack her master, she turned her vocal artillery against the younger scoundrel.

‘Well, Mr. Earnshaw,’ she cried, ‘I wonder what you’ll have agait next? Are we going to murder folk on our very door-stones? I see this house will never do for me—look at t’ poor lad, he’s fair choking! Wisht, wisht; you mun’n’t go on so. Come in, and I’ll cure that: there now, hold ye still.’

With these words she suddenly splashed a pint of icy water down my neck, and pulled me into the kitchen. Mr. Heathcliff followed, his accidental merriment expiring quickly in his habitual moroseness.

I was sick exceedingly, and dizzy, and faint; and thus compelled perforce to accept lodgings under his roof. He told Zillah to give me a glass of brandy, and then passed on to the inner room; while she condoled with me on my sorry predicament, and having obeyed his orders, whereby I was somewhat revived, ushered me to bed.",Emily Brontë,1969,"[4, 3, 5, 5, 9, 21, 30, 38, 60, 87]",10

9,Take A Letter Maria,"Last night as I got home about a half past ten
There was the woman I thought I knew
In the arms of another man

I packed some clothes and I walked out
And I ain't going back again

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

You've been many things but most of all a good secretary to me
And it's times like this I feel you've always been close to me
Was I wrong to work nights to try to build a good life
All work and no play has just cost me a wife

So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Say I won't be coming home, gonna start a new life
So take a letter Maria, address it to my wife
Send a copy to my lawyer, gotta start a new life

When a man loves a woman it's hard to understand
That she would find more pleasure in the arms of another man
I never really noticed how sweet you are to me
It just so happens I'm free tonight
Would you like to have dinner with me

22,Don't Cry Daddy/Rubberneckin',"FADE IN:

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

OTHO
Did you feel something?

Delia shakes her head.

OTHO
(continuing)
I felt a cool wind.

The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more
than he's telling.


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
the attic.


INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key
in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in
an exaggerated stance of relief.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.

OTHO
You don't have a key?

DELIA
Maybe Charles does.

OTHO
I have a feeling there's some very
interesting space behind this
door.

DELIA
(sarcastic)
Probably the world's largest
Reader's Digest collection!
C'mon, let's have some chablis,
Otho, I'm laid bare by this
experience.  Entirely bare.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Barbara still holding Adam's head.

Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.

ADAM'S HEAD
Whew!  That was close.

BARBARA
I cannot witness this.

Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
reattaches the head.


INT. STUDY - DAY

Adam turns away from the window.

Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild
gestures.

BARBARA
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people to
death?

ADAM
Oh, honey...

BARBARA
No, I'm not putting up with this.

She storms out of the room.


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-
stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as
she opens the door, Adam rushes up.

ADAM
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
there.  You don't know --

BARBARA
Nothing can be worse than this...

She flings open the door and steps outside.  She
promptly disappears.

ADAM
Barbara!


EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY

Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around
with wonder and some fear.


A SULFUR VOLCANO

erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid
EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's
VOICE.  Like THUNDER.

ADAM
Barbara!

She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
the surface of this distant moon.


BARBARA'S POV

Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering
isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.


BACK TO SCENE

Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.

BARBARA
Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm
getting all yellow.  Do something!


BEHIND THEM

Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
sand.  The Something could be right out of ""Dune"".


BARBARA AND ADAM

stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her
toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has
moved, so they veer in the new direction.

The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.


ON SOMETHING

It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING
SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.


BARBARA

slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.


THE SANDWORM

is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It
freezes and shakes its loathesome head.


BARBARA

bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her
away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.


ADAM

grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and
sink in the sand.

They make it to the door just in time, swing it open
and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a
BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.

THE SANDWORM

rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed
planet.


INT. KITCHEN

Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
alone.

ADAM
You left me.

BARBARA
I know.  I'm sorry.

She hugs him tight.

BARBARA
(continuing)
I just realized that I could have
been killed alone.  Don't ever
leave me, honey.

Both contemplate that horror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
We're trapped in this house
forever... with those... people.

ADAM
You can't say that for sure.  It
could be a transitional thing.
Like a post-life crisis.  We just
have to be tougher with them.
Come on.  Have some brandy.
Spirits?

BARBARA
(a tentative smile)
Death didn't improve your sense of
humor.

They head for the dining room.


INT. DINING ROOM

Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their
dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam
back out of the room but stop to listen.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are
candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating
out of Chinese take-out boxes.

DELIA
I can't believe that we're eating
Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
up here?  Hunan?

CHARLES
There's only one Chinese
restaurant out here, darling, the
owners are Irish and Irish people
happen to cook Cantonese.  They
don't know better.

LYDIA
I plan to have a stroke from the
amount of MSG that's in this food.

DELIA
This is our first meal in this
house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
our little private parts to make
it a pleasant one?

CHARLES
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
darkroom in the basement.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
My whole life is a darkroom!
One... big... dark... room.

Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this
before.

DELIA
Nonsense... you'll go to school,
maybe meet a farm boy.

Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.

LYDIA
(doleful)
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
let me hang myself from a rope in
his barn.

CHARLES
Lydia, in a couple of years this
whole town will be filled with
people like us.

DELIA
We'll be the art center of summer
New York.  I'll start sculpting
again... I'll teach those gallery
bastards to refuse my sculpture.
And when Otho and I get through
with this house, you people are
not going to recognize it.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
I say let's keep it the way it is.

Delia stares at Lydia.

CHARLES
(smiles)
Good idea!

Delia shifts her glare to Charles.

LYDIA
I do.  I really like it.  I
mean, it's already sort of like
somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
couch is comfortable and doesn't
stick to your legs.  It smells
like a real home, not a French
whorehouse.

DELIA
Lydia, at your age, you are so
young.
(back to business)
Charles, we need to call that
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
and get the key to the attic door.
Can't you find a way to hold back
some of her commission?

CHARLES
We're going to have a lot to do
tomorrow...
The Goodwill truck is coming.

DELIA
... and whatever is up there in
that attic goes away with it.

CHARLES
Should have it fumigated, too.  I
saw a fly today.

Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
anger.


OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS

-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down
her face.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.


EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY

The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.
In the road on front of the house are several cars of
rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.
The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move
in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.
They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the
Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say
""We're next!""  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-
ously.

BARBARA
Look in the index...

ADAM
Not really...  what's this?

Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,
crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.

ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.

ADAM (V.O.)
(reading)
Having difficulty adjusting?
Is death a problem and not a
solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
Troubled by the living?  Call
Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...

The remainder of the sheet is torn off.

ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the
book for the remainder.  No luck.

BARBARA
That's it?  No number, or
instructions?

ADAM
Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
don't get it...


INT. KITCHEN

Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a
2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small
kitchen window.

CHARLES
(shouting through
the window)
What the hell are you trying to do
out there?


DELIA - OUTSIDE

is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.


LYDIA

snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole
house.


LYDIA'S POV

When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly
glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.


BACK TO SCENE

Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks
all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.


JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR

pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened
with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.

Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.

Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the
strange.  Lydia stares at her.

LITTLE JANE
Are you a boy or a girl?

LYDIA
I only speak to vertebrates.

LYDIA
What happened to the people who
used to live here?

LITTLE JANE
(ratty little voice)
They drowned!

JANE
Yes, they were family.  I was
devastated.
(beat)
Here, darling.

Jane hands a key to Lydia.

LYDIA
(impressed)
Is this the key to the attic?

JANE
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
any door in that house.  Will you
give it to your father?
(handing her a
business card)
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated the
house.  In case he needs advice in
that area.  Come see me.

Jane goes away.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty
attic window.

DELIA (O.S.)
Help!  Get off me!

Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-
tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat
against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-
tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia
snaps a quick photograph.

They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,
just short of tearing her hair out.

DELIA
You jerks!  That is my art, and it
is dangerous!  You think I want to
want to die like that?
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
So buckle down now and go get
Mommy some drugs.

LYDIA
Any particular kind?

DELIA
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!

Lydia walks off toward the house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.

BARBARA
That little girl saw us.

ADAM
She couldn't have.  We can't make
them see us.

BARBARA
But she saw us.  I could feel it.

ADAM
(pause, thinking
that over)
That's all we need.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's
a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.

IN THE HALL

At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men
who are carrying books into the room that will be his
study.

He continues on.


A BLAST of STEAM

fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at
the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at
stairway to attic, mounting courage.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY

Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her
pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up
confidently.

ADAM
(whispering)
Don't worry.  I've locked it.

Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.


INT. ATTIC LANDING

Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns
harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no
go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all
the way around.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each
other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe
toward door.


ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET

in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly
image POPS ON.


ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW

outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-
sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very
quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)


BEHIND HIM

the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a
la Cal Worthington.

BETELGEUSE
(singing)
Have the living got you down?
Betelgeuse!
Are they jacking you around?
Betelgeuse!
Have you broken out in hives
'Cause you're tired of their jive?
I will drive them from your
hive... Betelgeuse!


ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with
""BETELGEUSE"" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut
it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind
set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to
the screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS
ON AGAIN.

BETELGEUSE
Say it once... Betelgeuse
Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
The third time's a charm...
Betelgeuse!
Come on down!

He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.


INT. LANDING - DAY

Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her
hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
the floor.

Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

CHARLES
What are you doing?


INT. ATTIC

Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With
her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.

The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of
the living intruders.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES

LYDIA
I was just trying to open the
door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
over a skeleton key.

CHARLES
Let me have it.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam tighten.


ON THE LANDING

LYDIA
But it doesn't work.

She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and
throws it in the corner.

CHARLES
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
this can wait.  We'll get a
crowbar later.  Where's your
mother?

LYDIA
(very quick de-
cisive delivery)
Stepmother.

CHARLES
I'm going down to relax.  I want a
noise-free zone.  Do you
understand?  Noise-free.

He goes down the stairs.

LYDIA
Dad?

He continues.

CHARLES
(irritated, over
his shoulder)
What?

LYDIA
I'm lonely.

A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.
Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.

CHARLES
What?


TIGHT ON LYDIA

She is resolved.

LYDIA
Nothing.

Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.


ON KEY

behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs
the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-
thing but doesn't see.


INT. ATTIC

Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.

ADAM
(looking through
the handbook)
We need some help.  I found
something this morning.  Here.
Emergencies.
(reads)
""In case of emergency, draw door.""

BARBARA
Draw door?  I don't know why we
keep looking in that stupid book.

Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
the exposed brick of the chimney.

BARBARA
(continuing)
You don't actually think this
is going to work?

Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The
door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.

BARBARA
Yet another triumph for Adam and
Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
don't we try this Beetle guy??...

ADAM
Wait.

He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND
ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even
more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.

Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.
She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.

ADAM
(continuing)
Aha!  Knock three times.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door
swings magnificently open.

Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.

Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold
hands and step tentatively through.

Their figures are lost in the blinding light.

They start to shut door after them.


ON THE ATTIC LANDING

Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
attic door.  It suddenly goes out.

ON LYDIA

She is dumbfounded.  She listens.


ON THE LANDING

Lydia speeds down the steps.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY

Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a
catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He
stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries
like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book
under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around
tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.

He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an
Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's
the comics and then looks around for more.

He finds the ""Illustrated Walden"" by Thoreau.  He
speed reads it.

He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries
to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:

OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
STUDY.

He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal
picture.

Takes field glasses and looks out window.


HIS POV

Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.


ON CHARLES

horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.

Lydia enters.  He jumps.

CHARLES
Jesus Christ!

Lydia is shocked.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Darling, can't you see I'm
relaxing in here!

LYDIA
Well I just wanted to tell you
what I saw.

CHARLES
Lydia.  What the hell is the point
of my moving up here if you people
won't let me relax?  Go help your
mother.

Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She
looks at him in frustration.

LYDIA
(on her way out)
Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
haunted house.  But I can't.

She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.
Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses
to get a better look.


HIS POV

It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-
ishing the brass lion.


ON CHARLES

He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his
discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field
glasses throughout the following.)

CHARLES
Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
lines... bad roof.  Good
parking... hmmm???

That really registers with him.  Without looking, he
dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,
lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-
posefully.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
Botco International.

CHARLES
Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
Dean.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
He's not in right now.

CHARLES
Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called.

He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.
Clacks his teeth.

CHARLES
(continuing)
My God what I could do with that
parking.

DISSOLVE TO:


TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM

Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left
-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what
they see, though we don't yet see it.

ADAM
... Not what I expected when we
walked through that door.

BARBARA
No. But it's somewhere without big
worms.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
in:


INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,
couches propped up on telephone books.

Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors
patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the
covers torn off.  The ""Take a number"" registers in the
millions.


AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM

We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's
receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,
bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon
across her breast reading ""MISS ARGENTINA"" and there
are knife slashes across both wrists.

RECEPTIONIST
You don't have an appointment, do
you?

ADAM
W... We didn't know how to make one.

BARBARA
An appointment for what?

RECEPTIONIST
What do you want?

BARBARA
We need some help.

RECEPTIONIST
Already?  You just bit the big one
nine months ago and you want help?

ADAM
Nine months?  What difference does
that make?

RECEPTIONIST
(shrugging)
Good luck.  You're going to use up
all your help vouchers.

ADAM
Help vouchers?

RECEPTIONIST
D-90's.  You spend a hundred
and twenty-five years on earth,
actually, in that house, during
which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
probably haven't even read through
the manual completely yet.

BARBARA
Why three?


TYPIST

Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of
which have only three fingers on them.

TYPIST
Rule Number Three.  Everything
comes in threes...

RECEPTIONIST
You'll have to wait if you don't
have an appointment.

BARBARA
How long do we have to wait?

ADAM
Wait for who?

RECEPTIONIST
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
that it matters to your type.  But
there are all these other people
here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
hours.

The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead
people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of
carnal shreddage.

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very
quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

RECEPTIONIST
(continuing)
Number 54 million, six hundred
one.  Ferndock.

CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY

Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an
ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file
into the door.  She struggles, and after several
attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The
door swings open ominously.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust
motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.

She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's
frightened, then entranced.

She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-
gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an
unfinished area.  She continues around the model,
oblivious to everything else.  Then...

She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes
up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the
handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked
page... looks at the chalk door.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they
hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.

BARBARA
(to Adam)
Is this what happens when you die?

The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.

RECEPTIONIST
This is what happens when YOU die.
(points to another
corpse)
That is what happens when HE dies.
That is what happens when THEY
die.  It's highly personal.  And
I'll tell you something... if I
knew then what I know now... I
wouldn't have had my little
""accident!""

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,
wriggles them indicating her slashes.

OTHER CORPSES
(all together)
Amen!

Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing
what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The
Receptionist looks up.

Barbara and Adam also look O.S.


THEIR POV

A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a
pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the
MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a
shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.
A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He
smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.

RECEPTIONIST
Maitland, party of two!  Take your
handbook and go to the sixth door.

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

BARBARA
We forgot our handbook.

CUT TO:


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.

CHARLES (O.S.)
(from distant
downstairs)
Lydia, Delia needs your help!

Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to
the door quickly and silently.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Right now, Delia says!


INT. OFFICE - DAY

RECEPTIONIST
(shaking her head
in disgust)
Out that way, through the typing
pool, down the corridor, sixth
door on your left.  Sixth door.
Two threes.
(shaking her head)
Airhead.

Adam and Barbara walk through a door.


INT. TYPING POOL - DAY

A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight
out of ""How To Succeed In Business""... Each desk is
occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely
skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their
typewriters.

Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is
typing slowly, with long pauses between words.

The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and
Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.

MESSENGER
How do I look?  There're no
mirrors on this side.

ADAM
(trying to be
pleasant)
Fine, you look fine.

MESSENGER
Thanks.  I've been feeling a
little flat.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line
runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.
A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
onto the floor.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Barbara and Adam enter corridor.

Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of
different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,
church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,
covered by a roll-up shade.

BARBARA
A hundred twenty-five years!
I can't believe it.  I can't
believe they didn't tell us.

She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She
stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.


THEIR POV

A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma
floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD
MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of
the bodies in this horrible human soup.

BARBARA
Adam, look at this.

Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the
other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.
It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and
blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a
flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look
ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Oh, Adam... what is this?

A reflection joins them on their side of the window.


A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR

wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.

SINISTER MAN
That's the lost souls room.
A room for ghosts who have been
exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
death for the dead.  It's all in
the handbook.  Keep moving.

The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
their house.

ADAM
This is it... the sixth door.

Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is
obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.
Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through
into the living room.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.

ADAM
My God, we're back home.

BARBARA
Look at this, everything is
different down here.  All our
furniture is gone.

ADAM
How long do you suppose we were
waiting?

JUNO
Three months.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.
She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-
dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse
of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-
sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.

JUNO
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
about to leave.  I do have other
clients.

BARBARA
Are you Juno, our caseworker?

JUNO
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
and determine if help is needed,
deserved, and available.

BARBARA
We need help.  We deserve help.

ADAM
Are you available?

JUNO
No.
(beat)
What's wrong?

BARBARA
We're very unhappy.

JUNO
What do you expect?  You're dead.

ADAM
We'd like some help in getting rid
of the people who moved in here.
Barbara and I worked very hard on
this house.

BARBARA
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were --

JUNO
-- like you used to be?

BARBARA
Yes.

ADAM
But these people --

He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-
ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.


INT. HOUSE

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
up in their attic space.

JUNO
Things seem pretty quiet here.
You should thank God you didn't
die in Italy.
(checking the file)
The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
studying the manual?

ADAM
We tried.

JUNO
The Intermediate Interface chapter
on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
out yourself.  It's your house.
Haunted houses don't come easy.

BARBARA
We don't quite get it.

Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.

JUNO
I heard.
(refers to her file)
Tore your face right off!  Bad
news.  It obviously doesn't do
any good to pull your heads off in
front of people if they can't see
you.

ADAM
We have to start simpler, is that
it?

JUNO
Start simply.  Do what you know.
Use your talents.  Practice.  We
only help those who help
themselves.  Just do a little at a
time.  And of course, practice,
practice, practice.  It's tricky
but -- you weren't murderers by
any chance, were you?

BARBARA
No.

JUNO
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
easy time of it.  Just look at
Amityville.
(reminiscing)
He was one of my boys.  Didn't
have to give that one any lessons.
From day one... But I must be
off... I've got a plane load of
football players crashed in the
midwest... they need a lot of
help, just with the basics.

Points at her head indicating dumbness.

BARBARA
If... we have trouble.  What about
the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

JUNO
(quickly interrupt-
ing her)
Don't say his name, you don't want
his help.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.

ADAM & BARBARA
Well... We might...


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A
FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.

JUNO
No you don't!  He does not work
well with others.

BARBARA
What do you mean?  What's he do?

A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light
changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
a campfire.

JUNO
I wasn't going to bring it up --
but rather than have you stumble
into it and make another mistake,
I'll tell you --
(she nervously puffs
her cigarette)
He was my assistant, but he was a
troublemaker...
He went out on his own as a free-
lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
get rid of the living... got into
more trouble -- you remember the
Chicago Fire...

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.

JUNO
(continuing)
He was demoted to a Grade-6
malevolent spirit.  He's been
imprisoned on that plane ever
since... in fact, I believe he's
been sleezing around your cemetery
lately.  He can only be brought
back by saying his name three
times.

Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --

JUNO
(continuing)
But I strongly suggest that you
remove the Deetz's yourself.

She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to
FADE.

ADAM
And if we need you again, how do
we...?

Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks
at the cemetery.

BARBARA
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
Adam.

ADAM
(holds her shoul-
ders, calms her)
Look, she's right.  We'll just
start simple, honey, be tougher.
I feel... confident.  C'mon.

They exit.


CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL

The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of
the cemetery.


THE FLY

resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles
with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.

VOICE
Pssstt!  Over here!

Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
a candy bar.

VOICE
I can't use this.  You should have
it.  Flies get so little respect
anymore.


THE FLATTERED FLY

walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab
the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
grave and then pull it into the earth.

FLY
Buzzz!
(turns into)
Help me!  Help me!

A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as
the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-
stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:

BETELGEUSE

CLAP OF THUNDER.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in
front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and
oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.

CHARLES
Maxie, have I not always made you
money?  I think that is the only
real question here.


INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE
DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler
dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.
Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to
Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde
wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.

MAXIE
Well, Charles -- no one has made me
money like you.  Until your nerves
went, you were a demon.  It is
just that... Winter River,
Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
no fucking where.  Why would I
invest that kind of money to buy
an old building way the hell up
there?


INTERCUT CONVERSATION

CHARLES
Not a building!  That's the beauty
of it.  I think I can buy the
whole town.  These people don't
know the value of their property!

MAXIE
Then we own a whole town full of
nowhere.

CHARLES
No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
come up here and see, then I'll
tell you about it.

Maxie isn't much interested.

MAXIE
Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
here... you know how it was when
you were active.

This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears
something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW
MOANING.

CHARLES
(into telephone)
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.

MAXIE
No listen... we'll talk about
this visiting later, I gotta go,
I gotta meeting on the Japanese
joint venture.

CHARLES
(torn between the
MOANING and Maxie)
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
could run it for us.  Listen,
think right about it, will you?
We've almost got the house ready,
you bring Sarah with you and I'll
show you.

MAXIE
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
there, ya hear?

Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.

MAXIE
(continuing)
Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He
goes to the door and flings it open.

A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under
a sheet.  But a ""designer"" sheet.  He wails away like a
banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-
covers.

CHARLES
Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
so boring that you have to think
up shit like this?

ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-
ing skeptically.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
Darling, Dad's found a way to make
some money here while I relax, so
scram!

He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around
again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-
ing, beaten.

CHARLES
(continuing)
And your mother is going to kill
you when she sees that you cut
holes in her $300 sheets.  You
provoke her you know.  I mean she
can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
you do provoke her.

He SLAMS the door again.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.

BARBARA
God, this is so corny.  Have we
been reduced to this?  Sheets?

ADAM
Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!
(imitating Juno)
Practice, practice, practice.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.
Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside
the bed.

ADAM
Deep breath... and...


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-
denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it
is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.

LYDIA
Gross!  How can he stand that
woman?
(louder)
Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
For God sakes!

The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.

BARBARA
I feel really stupid.

ADAM
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.
Do you want this woman for
breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
louder!

Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.

Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.

Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-
trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off
the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost
to the world totally.

Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.
When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in
her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam
and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.

LYDIA
Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
you're going to do weird sexual
stuff you ought to stay in your
bedroom, okay?

Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the
developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.

Lydia yelps with fear.

LYDIA
Holy cow!  No feet!

She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes
back toward them, starts flashing pictures.

Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a
corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.

Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting
with fear.  A standoff.

LYDIA
(continuing)
A... Are you the guys who're
hiding out in the attic?

ADAM
(fake terror voice)
We're ghosts.

Barbara moans.

LYDIA
(skeptical, cautious)
W... What do you look like under
there?

Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into
the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their
conversation.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

All three stare at each other tentatively.

ADAM
Aren't you scared?

LYDIA
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
Those are sheets.  Are you gross
under there?  Are you ""Night of
the Living Dead"" under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?

ADAM
What?

LYDIA
""Night of the Living Dead?""  It's
a movie.

BARBARA
(pulling off
the sheet)
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been frightened out
of my wits.

LYDIA
You're not gross.  Why were you
wearing a sheet?

BARBARA
We're practicing.

ADAM
You can actually see us?  Without
the sheets?

LYDIA
Is this like a trick question?

BARBARA
Tell the truth.

LYDIA
(offended)
Of course I can see you.

ADAM
Nobody else can.

LYDIA
I'm wearing contacts... Also I
read through the ""Handbook for the
Recently Deceased.""  It says that
live people ignore the strange and
unusual... I, myself, am strange
and unusual.

BARBARA
(tenderly)
You look like a regular girl to me.

Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-
ning to like Lydia.

ADAM
You read our book?  Could you
follow it?

Lydia nods her head.

LYDIA
Why are you creeping around
Delia's bedroom?

ADAM
We were trying to scare your
mother.

LYDIA
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
about being related to reptiles.

Barbara smiles.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You can't scare her.  She's
sleeping with Prince Valium
tonight.
(defiantly)
I stole the key to your attic, you
know.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.

BARBARA
Maybe we better talk.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and
Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the
town, dimly lighted giants.

LYDIA
You did this?  You carved all
these little figures and houses
and things?

ADAM
(pleased)
I certainly did.  I'd finish it
too, but... I don't get out much.

LYDIA
And this used to be your house, I
bet.  Why do you want to scare
everybody?

ADAM
We want to frighten you away.
(a little embarrassed)
So that you'll move out.

LYDIA
You don't know the Deetz's very
well, do you?  My father bought
this place.  He never walks away
from equity.  Why don't you leave?

BARBARA
We can't.  We haven't left the
house since the funeral.

LYDIA
Funeral.  God, you guys really are
dead!
(fascinated)
What was it like?  The funeral.
Did you cry?

ADAM
We weren't there.  The handbook
says funerals aren't for the dead.

LYDIA
God, if this is true this is
amazing!  I kinda like it up
here.  Can I visit you sometimes?

ADAM
Well, I don't know... We don't get
many visitors.

BARBARA
You know you're really a pretty
girl.

Lydia flushes.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Lydia!

LYDIA
I better go...

BARBARA
Wait... I don't think it would be
a very good idea if you told your
parents that we're up here.

ADAM
Unless you think it would scare
them off.

Lydia starts to exit.

ADAM
(continuing)
You tell them that we are
desperate horrible ghoulish
creatures who will stop at nothing
to get back our house.

LYDIA
(looks him up
and down)
Wait a minute, what if this is a
dream?  Can you do any tricks to
prove I'm not dreaming?

Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Well, if you are real ghosts, you
better get another routine, those
sheets suck!

She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to
the yard.


INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY

The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making
Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.
She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's
just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.

DELIA
Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
shredded from doing the laundry,
and now I have to deal with your
vandalism!


INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet
print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-
ond floor with the scissored sheets.

DELIA
Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
kill you.  I'm having a party
tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get
servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
certainly do not!

Lydia speeds by her.

DELIA
(continuing)
You owe me three-hundred bucks,
Lydia!  Don't go running to your
father, you worm.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a
word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.

LYDIA
Dad.  Do you believe me?

CHARLES
Yes.  Except when you creep around
in your mother's --

LYDIA
Stepmother's...

CHARLES
... sheets.

LYDIA
Well this is... I mean, this is
the weirdest --

CHARLES
Lydia, I don't know what it is
with you and these pratical
jokes, but --

LYDIA
This is not a joke!  That sheet
was full of ghosts.

She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points
out...

LYDIA
(continuing)
No feet.

Charles laughs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You don't believe me.  That sheet
was full of ghosts.  They live
here.

Charles begins to scroll through computer program.

CHARLES
(dismissing it)
Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
please -- I'll tell you what... I
know!  You're bored, right?  You
take that camera and your bike
and photograph every building in
town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
for...
(handing her a
wad of bills)
Here, take some cash and go do
it.  How's that?  You want to
stretch, don't you?

Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on
the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter
River, just like Adam's in the attic.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Look at the size of these lots...

Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

ADAM
What is this guy doing?

Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.
Exits.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner
party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show
her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.

DELIA
I can't believe you are doing this
to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a
dinner party for seven people
tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
back for the demolition of the
attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
bringing some woman who writes for
""Art in America.""  In fact, no one
here tonight has not been in
""Vanity Fair.""  Except you.

LYDIA
(resigned)
I told them you were too mean to
be afraid.

DELIA
Don't you dare talk to others
about me.  I'm an artist!  The
only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my
friends.  Do you know how hard it
is to get civilized people to set
foot in this part of Connecticut?
Not a solitary word of this
pubescent tripe to anyone.

Lydia exits angrily.

CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at
Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam
appears.

BARBARA
Lydia's trying, but they don't
believe her.

ADAM
She's got photos, Barbara.

BARBARA
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

ADAM
This is different.  Eventually
she'll take someone to the attic.
And then what?  We've got to try
to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
gotta get some help, hon.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

Adam looks intently through the book.

Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model
cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone
lit up by neon.

BARBARA
Adam!

Adam comes over.  Looks.

ADAM
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

BARBARA
It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
Betelgeuse...

She looks at Adam, ""should I?"" Adam chews his lip
thoughtfully.

ADAM
Go ahead... third time's a charm.

BARBARA
(after a deep breath)
Betelgeuse!

ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and
Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized
clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,
throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps
slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.

BARBARA
What happened?

ADAM
Three times.  Powerful number.

BARBARA
(standing in front
of grave)
Bet... el... geuse.  What an
awful name.  I thought it was like
-- you know.  The juice of
beetles.

Adam cringes too.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Where is he?  What do we do?

Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.
Nothing.

ADAM
Has anything been simple so far?
From the look of the shovel, we
dig.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
My nails keep getting longer.
I'll break them.

Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT

They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both
almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --
Adam suddenly hits wood.

BARBARA
It's about time.

They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
coffin.

""BETELGEUSE""

ADAM
I guess we open it.

BARBARA
Maybe we should knock first?

A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other
and try to scramble from the grave.


TOPSIDE

They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,
and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She
screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her
back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's
head.

Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three
stop.


ON THE CORPSE

Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then
the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight
up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against
the tombstone...

And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge
marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from
behind the gravestone.


PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE

steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out
from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.
Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words
and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is
mighty uneasy.

BETELGEUSE
All right.  Who are you?

BARBARA
We're...

BETELGEUSE
You're the dead.

ADAM
Aren't you dead?

BETELGEUSE
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
businessman.  I'm the man what
am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who
do I gotta kill?

ADAM
You don't kill anyone.

BARBARA
Just get some people out of our
house.

BETELGEUSE
Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do
I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
Obnoxious, I bet.
(contorting face)
Mommie, daddy, piglets.

BARBARA
Just one daughter.

BETELGEUSE
Hey you've been on Saturn!
(brushing yellow dust
off her)
I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!
I've lost a lot of buddies to
Sandworms.
(back to work)
So a daughter?  She got good legs?
God I love a young leg.

Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He
leers.

BARBARA
She's only fourteen...

ADAM
... acts like she's thirty-five.

BETELGEUSE
(rubbing hands)
How does she feel about short old
men with dirty ears?

Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle
Juice senses it and gets back to business.

BETELGEUSE
So you, the dead, want me, the
undead, to throw the live guys --
Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
might not mind a tumble with an
older guy, out into the cold?
Even though they have paid hard
casharoonie for your dump?

ADAM
But... the Deetzes are destroying
our house.

BETELGEUSE
(scolding sarcasm)
You Maitlands are the backbone of
the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

ADAM
Can you scare them off?

Beetle Juice looks offended.

BETELGEUSE
Me, scary?  You be the judge.


ANGLE

He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying
image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.

BARBARA
(decisively)
Honey.  Let's go.

ADAM
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
help.

BARBARA
No, we don't.  We can work
something out ourselves.  We just
have to try harder.

BETELGEUSE
Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
missy.  You rang my bell, you
gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!


BARBARA

grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.

BETELGEUSE
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
your service.  You be the judge.
I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.

BARBARA
Home.  Home.  Home!


ZAP

They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.

BETELGEUSE
You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
you think you are?... Walking
away from a professional?


BETELGEUSE

walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree
falls, KABLOOM!


INT. ATTIC - DAY

A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the
room, walks over and straightens it.

He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.
Making notes.  Counting out procedures.

ADAM
Honey, I think that was a mistake.

BARBARA
I am not going to expose that
little girl to that... pervert
down there.

ADAM
How'd you do that?

BARBARA
(proud of herself)
Just a hunch... remember things
come in threes -- three times in,
three times out... I'm getting the
hang of this stuff.

ADAM
I think we really pissed him off.

BARBARA
I don't care...

ADAM
But we let him out.

BARBARA
I've changed my mind... I feel
really confident.  We're getting
better at this stuff.  We can
scare them off ourselves --
tonight!  I've got an idea.
You're going to love it... I'm
going to hate it.


ADAM

turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the
tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving
through the tiny model forest towards the house.

ADAM (V.O.)
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
seemed mad.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(singing)
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
go!


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very
nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.
The element is neurotic-chic.

Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having
had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a
bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the ""Art In Amer-
ica"" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens
to become a full-scale war.

Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite
occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses
of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,
the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is
dressed ""artistically.""

OTHO
(to Beryl)
Well, darling, you can only have a
hysterectomy once, so why don't you
tell us what you really went into
the hospital for last week?  Or dare
I ask, is that a nose ""nouveau?""

CHARLES
(privately; to
Otho)
Otho, you've got to help me get
Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
that could make all of us very
comfortable.

OTHO
He's a cloven-hooved beast!

CHARLES
He's your cousin.

OTHO
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
nothing short of giving away free
sacks of money would get him up
here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
it.  You can't get her out of
Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
(still on Beryl's
case)
I just hope it wasn't yet another of
your dreary suicide attempts.  You
know what they say about people who
who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

BERNARD
Otho!  I didn't know you were into
the supernatural?

OTHO
Of course you remember!  After my
stint with the living theatre.  I
was one of New York City's leading
paranormal researchers until the
bottom dropped out of the business
in '72.

BERYL
(sick to death of
this blowhard)
Paranormal... Is that what they're
calling your kind now?

Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-
ious.

Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.

DELIA
(a threat; quietly
to Lydia)
Don't you dare.

LYDIA
I saw some ghosts.

All quiet.

DELIA
(interrupting)
Lydia tried to play a most
amusing joke on me this afternoon.

LYDIA
It wasn't a joke.

DELIA
Tried to convince me that this
house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
Kids!  I love them.

Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.

GRACE
By ghosts?

LYDIA
By what else?

DELIA
(laughing it away)
In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.
They --

Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,
proposes a toast.

CHARLES
I propose a toast to our intrepid
friends.  Who braved the
expressway and fourteen toll
booths to visit us.  May your
buildings go condo.

All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-
nously spit out their wine.  All together now...

EVERYONE
Yechhh!

Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust
spans the room.

ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of
Thunderbird!

BERYL
Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
don't you even have a Safeway up
here?

DELIA
(horrified; but
recovering)
Joke Joke!  Charles get the good
wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
It's a joke.

Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles
rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and
peers at Lydia.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some
good wine.

DELIA
(rapidly; furious)
Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
if you do not agree right now, to
boarding school, you can forget
having what you call sex -- ever
again in your natural lifetime.

He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles
rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for
Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.
All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All
smile.

Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans
toward her...

OTHO
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
ghosts.

DELIA
No!  Do not encourage this
little... person.

OTHO
Oh, Delia, lighten up!

DELIA
She's been without therapy up here
and I will not allow her to
ruin...

But then:


DELIA

Something comes over her -- she straightens, then
crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of
her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,
unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world
behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a
rich, NEGRO TENOR.

DELIA
""If I didn't care, More than
words could say.""

Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are
spellbound.

Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.
In a voice not his own.

CHARLES
""If my every prayer, did not
begin and end with just your
name.""

Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.

DELIA
For God's sake, stop me...

She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.

DELIA
""I could not be true to you
beyond compare.""


ALL THE GUESTS

except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They
stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown
choreography.

EVERYONE
(except Lydia)
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

DELIA
""If I didn't care... for you...""

EVERYONE
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,
unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances
and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in
teen heaven.

NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While
it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
ing.

Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
see the ghosts.  She can't.

Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a
shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.

As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated
like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
into their chairs.  They sing throughout.


THE SONG

crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp
cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll
suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,
grabs his dangling tie and... smash --

WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back
over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.
Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.


EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
of the attic.  Door is open.

TOGETHER
We did it!

ADAM
Let's watch 'em scatter.

They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out
over the front yard.


YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT

filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia
and Charles' vehicles.

ADAM (O.S.)
Any minute now.  They'll all run
screaming.


BACK TO SCENE

They wait.  Nothing moving outside.

BARBARA
Your Ink Spots were wonderful!

Adam smiles proudly.

ADAM
And your shrimp was remarkable.

BARBARA
My shrimp?  I did the wine.
Didn't you do the sushi?

ADAM
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Who did the?

Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.

Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

LYDIA
(from outside the
door)
It's me.  Lydia.

Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is
standing there, sheepish.

LYDIA
(continuing)
They'd like for you to come
downstairs.  Delia says you can
pick any sheets you want.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs
are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in
Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks
at once.

DELIA
It does indicate a marvelously
urbane sense of humor on the part
of these ghosts -- that they
actually appear in sheets!

OTHO
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
must protect them, treat them with
respect.  Nurture them.

CHARLES
People will pay big money for
this.  Right, Grace?

GRACE
(nodding)
Charles, I want to know why you
didn't tell me about this --

DELIA
(now changing her
tune)
We were waiting for proof.
Lydia's photographs...

Charles is scheming.

BERNARD
(skeptical)
What are you all talking about?
We... we just got a little drunk,
that's all.

OTHO
No matter how drunk you get, you
cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
(to Charles)
Charles, this is it!  You can get
Maxie Dean up here now.

Charles plots and plans.

OTHO
His wife Sarah loves the
supernatural.  I did a reading for
her just last week.  Told her her
jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
she will make him sprint up here in
his helicopter if you can produce
ghosts for her.

BERYL
The ""Enquirer"" has offered fifty
thousand dollars for absolute
proof of life after death.  I'll
send them over.

BERNARD
I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
money for years on her work.  If
anything actually happened here,
I'll handle it, thank you.  But
not until I see some real proof.

Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone
stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.

LYDIA
They don't want to come down.

OTHO
Why not?

Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
hoax.  He harumphs!

LYDIA
I think the reason is they were
trying to scare you, and you
didn't get scared --

DELIA
Of course we weren't scared.
(looking around)
Just a little startled.  One of
those shrimp dropped down my
Kamali.

Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-
on.

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Total collective hallucination.

BERYL
I was a little tipsie.

DELIA
This was not a hallucination,
people.  This was real, really
totally real.

GRACE
Of course, they were rather
spectacular effects -- for
Connecticut, I mean.

OTHO
All presences have a home space.  A
place where they live, so to speak.
Where do they hide out?

LYDIA
(reluctantly)
The attic.

CHARLES
The attic room is locked --

LYDIA
They're ghosts.  They do what they
want.

OTHO
Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's ""Locked
Door"" ghosts!  Probably committed
suicide up there -- hanging like
beeves from the rafters.  I'm
totally enchanted.

Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.

BERNARD
Delia, you are a flake.  You have
always been a flake.  I'm packing
up and going back to the tricks of
the city.  That I can manage.  If
you must frighten people, do it
with your sculpture.

They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

DELIA
Wait!  I'm going to get to the
bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
some high-tech trick of yours?  I
want you to take us up there tout
sweet!


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.

DELIA
(whispering)
Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
they live like animals.  This is
where they've been hiding out?

Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the
door.

DELIA
(shouting)
All right, you dead people!  Come
on out, or we'll break down this
door and drag you out on the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

LYDIA
Shhhh.  They didn't commit
suicide.

DELIA
It doesn't matter.
What matters is I've got a roomful
of guests down there, who think
I'm a fraud.
(to Lydia)
I am going to teach you something
here Lydia.  You've got to take
the right tone in things like
this, or people -- whether they're
dead or alive -- people will walk
all over you.
(loud)
Come on out, or I will make death
so miserable that you will wish
you had never lived!

Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,
Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one
they straighten up and look around.

DELIA
(whisper)
So where are they, Lydia?

Lydia shrugs, looks around.

CHARLES
(off-handedly)
Answer your mother.

LYDIA
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
are really nice people.  I think
we scared them off.  Let's just
leave them alone.  Okay?

Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the
model.

CHARLES
It's the whole damn town.

They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks
at the empty room and the model.

OTHO
Look at that detail!

DELIA
Look at the tiny figures.

CHARLES
Look at all that parking!

LYDIA
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

OTHO
They're not here, Lydia?

She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms
it.

DELIA
I have never been so
embarrassed... They haven't gone
for good, have they?

Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.

DELIA
(continuing)
Everyone out of there.  If they're
in there somewhere, I don't want
to scare them away.  Come on now,
stay out of there.  We've got work
to do.

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.
Delia carefully closes the door.


CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW

We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the
window sill from the outside.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.
CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from
the house --

They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --


ON INFERNO

circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver
up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small
geysers spurt foul gasses.


WINDS

BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold
on and pull themselves back up and into the window.

ADAM
Juno, help!  Juno!

After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and
they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one
by one.  All are holding the handrail.

DELIA
Lydia, I will never forgive you
for embarrassing me in front of my
social inferiors.  You help us
with these ghosts or you'll be
sorry.

LYDIA
I'm sorry already.

CHARLES
(fixing on Otho)
Now, let's get back to business.  I
I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
up here immediately.  I can make
history here!  I'm going to turn
this sleepy little backward town
into a leading supernatural
research center... and amusement
park.

LYDIA
(disgusted)
I cannot believe this.

CHARLES
Delia will cook...

Delia glares at him.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I'll bring the wine... and the
business plan.  And Lydia --
you'll bring the ghosts.

LYDIA
(frustrated)
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're
not here!

CHARLES
... Otho, could you actually... do
something with them?

OTHO
(pats the handbook
under his coat)
Perhaps... if I were properly
motivated...

LYDIA
That's slavery and murder.  You
don't know them.  They're nice
people!

POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.
Lydia lags behind, sullen.


LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL

lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,
diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.
It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered
comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.


ON DELIA

She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
-- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the
snake.


THE SNAKE

just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia
and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake
gives her a big wet snake kiss.


SNAKE

snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.


THE SNAKE

rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.


ALL THREE

of them fall over each other trying to escape.


THE SNAKE

hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils
and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then
it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

SNAKE
We've come for your daughter,
Chuck!


HE

leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the
bannister.  Charles screams.


THE SNAKE

Grins at a terrified Lydia.


SNAKE

rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.
One word is heard.

BARBARA
Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!
Betelgeuse!


THE SNAKE

looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands
an angry Barbara.

What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
see.


THE SNAKE

shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-
rail.


BETELGEUSE

or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,
and is gone like a rocket.

BETELGEUSE
RRRatt shit!


OTHO AND DELIA

rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.

LYDIA
I hate you!  I thought you were my
friends.

BARBARA
No, wait!

Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.

LYDIA
(screams)
I hate all of you!

Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.

ADAM
Great choice we've got here.  We
get to spend the next century
either hanging out that window or
doing parlor tricks.

Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-
ing.

ADAM
Maybe they'll leave now.  That
snake was a pretty nasty customer.

BARBARA
He might have hurt somebody.

ADAM
But he didn't.  We've got him
where we want him.


ON THE MODEL

A column of water shoots high in the air.

Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.


INT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his
fist at Adam.

BETELGEUSE
You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare
you do that to me.  I coulda
finished the job!


IN THE ATTIC

Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one
another with concern.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(thin and pip-
ing voice)
Why did you stop me?

BARBARA
I don't like Charles Deetz
particularly, but you could have
killed him.

BETELGEUSE
Hey, I've been bottled up for six
hundred years.  Every dog has his
day.  This is my town.  I need a
night to howl.

ADAM
This is my town.

BETELGEUSE
You wish!  I nearly scored with
that little blonde.  I need me a
short little queen.


ANGLE

Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
Betelgeuse up.

Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him
slightly.

BARBARA
You leave her alone, you horrid
little prick!


CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all
over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and
fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-
mets.


EXT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is
defiant.

BETELGEUSE
Go ahead.  Make my millenium!


ANGLE

We hear the tinny strains of ""Honky Tonk Angel"" as if
from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.

BETELGEUSE
This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
getting anxious if you know what I
mean.  Six hundred years and all.

He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --
women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,
beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
swaggers inside.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara aghast, watching this from above.

BARBARA
Adam!  Why did you build a whore
house?  Have you ever been to...?

ADAM
I didn't --


ANGLE

He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the
attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They
close their eyes against the gale.

When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in
the attic.  They're in --


INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina
swishes by.

RECEPTIONIST
God, you have got her steaming
now.

She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place
is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to
wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She
sees them.  She is steaming mad.

JUNO
The whorehouse was my idea.  I
want Betelgeuse out of the
picture!  We've got some serious
talking to do.

BARBARA
About what?

JUNO
You people have really screwed
up!  I received word that you
allowed yourselves to be
photographed.  And you let
Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
back, and you let Otho get ahold
of the handbook.

ADAM
Handbook?  When...?

JUNO
(continuing tirade)
Never trust the living!  We cannot
have a routine haunting like yours
provide incontrovertible visual
proof of existence beyond death.

ADAM
Well, we didn't know --


A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS

follow Juno like hungry dogs.

DUMB #1
Hey, Coach, where's the men's
room?

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'm not your coach.  He survived.

DUMB #2
You don't need a men's room.
You're not no man no more.  But
Coach, let me get this -- What's
our curfew over here?

They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into
another room.

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'll be right back.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his
head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a
chair absent-mindedly.

DELIA
I feel like we've been at war,
Charles.

CHARLES
At least insofar as we have our
first casualty.  Me.

DELIA
Otho'll know what to do.

CHARLES
What's he going to do?  Viciously
rearrange their environment?

DELIA
Otho knows just as much about the
supernatural as he knows about
interior design.

CHARLES
Let's hope he knows how to produce
those damn ghosts for Max and
Sarah... Because I've bought
options on property all over town.
I need Max's financing...

DELIA
Just don't tell Lydia.

CHARLES
Why not?

DELIA
I think she's in with them.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.
DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.

Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress
appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.

She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows
her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.

LYDIA
I am alone.

She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I am utterly... alone.  You have
sealed my fate with your betrayal.
I can no longer stand to be used
like a puppet between two
deceitful worlds.  By the time you
read this, I will be gone, having
jumped off...

She scratches that out.

LYDIA
(continuing)
... having plummeted off the
Winter River Bridge.  Then you
will know that I am no longer a
toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
Lydia.

A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it
in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The
green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.


LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP

They look ominous.  She starts upward.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY

The door opens and Lydia peers in.

The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.

LYDIA
Are you here?

She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.
Nothing.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
for the last time?
(laying note on
table)
Where are you?  Barb...

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
They're dead.

Lydia looks around, then peers into model.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(continuing)
Think small.  I'm talking to you.


EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY

A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a
silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-
self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,
sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a
blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the
sky.

BETELGEUSE
Cookie, they are dead, dead,
deadski.

LYDIA
Of course they're dead.  They're
ghosts.

BETELGEUSE
No, I mean they've gone.
Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

LYDIA
Where'd they go?

BETELGEUSE
The happy hunting ground.  Who
cares?

LYDIA
Are you a spirit too?

BETELGEUSE
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
in this burg for hundreds of
years.  All I want is to get out.

LYDIA
I want to get in.

BETELGEUSE
You do?  Over here?  On my side?

LYDIA
I think so.

BETELGEUSE
(scheming quickly)
Well, yes, of course.  It's great
over here.  You'll meet all the
greats.  James Dean.  Sid
Vicious...

LYDIA
Well, it can't be any worse than
my life here.

BETELGEUSE
(sinister, encouraging
her)
That's right.  They treat you like
scum, I bet?

LYDIA
Yeah.

BETELGEUSE
I can't help you from this side,
but here's how we do it.  So
simple.  Say my name three
times.  That's all.  I'll be all
yours.  Then I'll bring you over
here in style.

LYDIA
I... I don't know what your name is.

BETELGEUSE
Minor problem.  The rules.  I
can't tell it to you.  But.. do
you know how to play charades?

LYDIA
Yes.

BETELGEUSE
Of course you do.

He holds up two fingers in a V.

LYDIA
Two words.

Betelgeuse holds up one finger.

LYDIA
(continuing)
First word.

Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Three syllables.

BETELGEUSE
No, dummy.  Two.

LYDIA
Your fingers are so small I can't
see them.  First word -- two
syllables.

He points behind her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I don't know what that signal
means.

BETELGEUSE
It means look behind you, bimbo.


ANGLE

Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a
Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach
out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.

LYDIA
Beetle!

BETELGEUSE
Good girrrl!

POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two
fingers.

LYDIA
(still shaken)
Second word.  Be careful.


ANGLE

Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange
juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a
ghostly glass.

LYDIA
Breakfast?  Orange?

The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.

LYDIA
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

BETELGEUSE
Good thing you are a beautiful
kid.  You are dumb!

Betelgeuse does the signal for ""Now Put Them Together.""

LYDIA
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?

BETELGEUSE
(jumping with delight)
That's it!

LYDIA
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!
That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.

BETELGEUSE
It's spelled different, but
basically... Now you said it
twice, just one more time.  And
I'll be free.
(sinister)
And then you'll be free.

Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at
him.


ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS

Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't
see anything, but maybe Lydia does.

LYDIA
God, you're anatomically correct!

BETELGEUSE
Just say it.

LYDIA
(recognizing something
about him)
You were the snake!  Right?  I
know.  It was you.

BETELGEUSE
You've got to say it!

LYDIA
No I don't.  I don't take orders
from Smurfs.

BETELGEUSE
How'd you like to be married to...
the King...?

Lydia doesn't get it.

BETELGEUSE
(continuing)
... Elvis?...
(boasting)
You know, ever since he came over
he and I have been just like this.
(crosses his fingers)
I can arrange it.  Just say my
name one more time.

She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.

LYDIA
No, No... I need to talk to
Barbara.

Betelgeuse smiles.

BETELGEUSE
Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
can get her.
(rubbing his horny little
hands together)
That and so much more...

Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.

LYDIA
Who else did you say is over
there?


INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

Juno staring at them, hard.

JUNO
Yes... or no?  Do you want the
Deetzes out or in?

ADAM
Out.

BARBARA
What about Betelgeuse?

JUNO
Forget him.  He'll remain with his
whores until someone calls him.
You need to worry about people like
Otho.  There are a lot of
phony trance mediums.  They
usually can't make the formulas
work, but if Otho stumbles on the
right words in that handbook... he
could hurt you.  As in --
exorcism.

They both look puzzled.

JUNO
(continuing)
In plain English -- that's death
for the dead.  I don't care what
it takes, just get them out of
there now.  It's not pretty, but
-- that's death!

Adam stands to go.

JUNO
(continuing)
Wait a minute.  Let's see what
you're going to do...

They look at Juno.

JUNO
(continuing)
... to scare her.  I want to make
sure it's not some silly parlor
trick.

Barbara looks at Adam.

ADAM
I'll do the hard part, hon.


ADAM

reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a
living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little
repulsed.

JUNO
Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
ahead.


ANGLE

She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
Adam's horror.

JUNO
(continuing)
Okay.  You look great!  Now go
clean house.  And don't forget the
photographs and the damned
handbook.


ANGLE

Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.
Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football
players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY
DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,
maybe sat too close to the engine.)

PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER
Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
survived the crash!

Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the
door.


OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE

They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find
themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/
Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-
knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly
face.

BARBARA
Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
little girl.

ADAM/MONSTER
It's too late.  Sometimes things
just work out this way.  We have
to, honey.

BARBARA/MONSTER
No we don't.  We can rebel or
something.  We'll just stay up
there in our room.  I'll read, you
can build on the model.  Come on.

She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows
her.

ADAM/MONSTER
Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
house...

She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.

BARBARA
I want to be with Lydia!

She throws open the door.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is standing over the model, about to say
Betelgeuse's name.

LYDIA
Okay.  Beetle... J...

Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!

BARBARA/MONSTER
!  Lydia, stop!

Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.
Screams.

ADAM/MONSTER
No, don't say it!

BETELGEUSE
Say it!  Rat shit!

Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
bushes.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia
struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out
the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.

Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.
Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/
Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.
Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and
daughter.

ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles
slightly at the scene.

BETELGEUSE (O.S.)
You lily-livered bleeding hearts!

BARBARA
I'm so sorry we frightened you.
What were you doing?

LYDIA
He... Beetle Jui...

Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.

LYDIA
(continuing)
He said if I let him out he would
take me over to the other side to
find you.

BARBARA
No, Lydia, we're dead.

LYDIA
I want to be dead, too.

BARBARA
(shocked)
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

LYDIA
(after a pause,
dramatically
but for real)
Life is just... unliveable...

Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an
unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person
out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.
Barbara looks at Adam.

BARBARA
Lydia, believe me... we know...
all the hard stuff is the same
over here.  You're going to be who
you are... whether you're alive or
dead... and over here -- it's...
It's flat... there's no food, no
colors... you can't smell the
flowers.
(thinking)
If we knew then what we know
now... we'd have been more
careful...

ADAM
(in the style of the
dead receptionist)
... we wouldn't have had our
little accident.

Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.

BARBARA
So never let Beetlejuice out --
never.  Besides...
(looking at Adam)
We're thinking about letting
everyone stay... you and your
father and mother can stay too.

LYDIA
(smiles and says
slowly)
Step... mother.


ADAM/MONSTER

is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to
change back into Adam, except for his nose, which
remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes
too.

Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.


ANGLE

Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in
through the door and grab the model.  They take it out
the door.

Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.

Barbara stops him from taking action.

ADAM
What is going on?

LYDIA
Really.  I don't know.

Adam looks suspiciously at her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I really don't.  I'll go find out.

She runs out the door.

BARBARA
Be careful.


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
room.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting
around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean
is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for
ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.

Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model
with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.

CHARLES
-- In short, I've got options to
buy enough of Main Street to
control the city council for a
hundred years.  And at the prices
I'm talking about, if it all fell
apart tomorrow, we just move out and
sell to the Arabs and we still come
out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
about a wax museum, here... in
Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
who made the talking Jesse Jackson
statue.
And I've got a museum dedicated to
50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
-- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
to the right to start an insect zoo
here in the old hardware store.
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia, did you finally decide to
join us?

They all give her an oily smile.

CHARLES
Honey, I am just finishing the first
phase presentation about our little
project here.  Then we'll take a
stretch and invite our friends... to meet
your friends.

Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her
excitement, silently urges him to get on with the
ghosts.

SARAH
Are they here yet?

MAXIE
Yes, Charles, let's cut the
bullcorn.  We're here to see
ghosts.  This whole ghost town
museum and such like follows a
train, if you've got the engine...
so let's see your goddamned engine.

Everyone looks at Lydia.

LYDIA
They're... not here anymore.

CHARLES
(smiling apologetically)
Nonsense, every time she says
that, the paint peels, and some
wild creature tries to kill us.

SARAH
(motioning)
We've got these pictures, Lydia.

LYDIA
No, really... they said they might
come back and all of us could live
in peace if you agreed not to
tease them or make them do silly
tricks.

Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes
over.

DELIA
She's become a little emotional
about all this.  No counseling up
here.  But we aren't relying on
her.  No, we rely on
professionals.  We have... Otho.

The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-
thing and mumbling.

CHARLES
Are they still here, Otho?

Otho looks up; he missed the question.

DELIA
Are they still here, Otho?

OTHO
Oh, they're still here.  They're
just not showing up.

CHARLES
They're probably guilty about what
they did to me.

DELIA
Not these people!  They are
ruthless!

MAXIE
I don't care from guilt.  I just
want to see them.

CHARLES
Otho, can you do it?

OTHO
It's tricky, but I think I can
handle it.

He dramatically produces the handbook.

LYDIA
No!

Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
to another point of view.

LYDIA
Wait a minute!  What am I worried
about?  Otho, you can't even
change a tire!

OTHO
(taking the challenge)
I'll need something personal of
theirs.

LYDIA
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

Delia gets an idea.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind
up.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara is looking out the window.

BARBARA
(wistful)
You know, I've been thinking.  I
could teach Lydia to sew.

ADAM
Little black party dresses?

BARBARA
(punching him playfully)
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
about little girls.  She's just...
missed out on some love, that's
all...

ADAM
(huffy)
Let's see if she can get my model
back.

BARBARA
You can build another one... with
her.

Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next
to her.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Come here, I want to talk to you.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays
something out on the dining room table.

DELIA
I'm deeply sentimental about...
weddings.

Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out
Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's
wedding tux.

Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.

LYDIA
(hushed realization)
Their wedding clothes.

OTHO
(dramatically)
Their wedding clothes.

Otho then holds up the handbook.

SARAH
The ""words"".

Otho nods.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia
turns out the lights.

OTHO
Hands vermillion / start of five
bright cotillion / raven's dive
nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
to the living / let now the dead...
come alive.

Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.

LYDIA
(sarcastically)
Doo wah.


ANGLE

Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the
square.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.

BARBARA
We've been given a gift here,
honey.  A real live little girl.
She likes us a lot.  She needs
us.  Maybe that's why we died so
young, to keep us from getting
so... attached to things.  The
house, antiques, your model.  Look
at us.  We didn't have room for
anyone.

ADAM
(after a long thought)
What makes you think she likes me?

Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.

He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --


ON BARBARA

Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches
out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her
but she is suddenly -- GONE.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.


ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:


ON THE DRESS

Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills
slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the
frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.

Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.

More lightning bolts.

OTHO
As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
As magic wonder / Mad affright
Rives asunder / Man's delight:
Our ghost, our corpse and we
Rise to be.

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.


ON BARBARA

She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,
but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we
can see she is calling for... Adam.

LYDIA
Stop it!

MAXIE
Shhhh!

Lydia screams for Adam.

LYDIA
Adam.  Adam.

OTHO
(louder)
As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
As goblin vizard, / At the spell
Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
The buried, dead, and slain...
Rise again.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for
Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.

ADAM
Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
slowly to disappear.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

On each of the watchers one by one, scared but
delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.

ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.


ON BARBARA

She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,
floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now
older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...

ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made
of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.

Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.

DELIA
What's happening to them?

OTHO
I don't know.

CHARLES
Are they suffering?

LYDIA
(screams)
They're dying.

MAXIE
They're already dead.  They can't
feel a thing.

Obviously not true.

ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with
effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward
Lydia.

Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then
something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.
Stares down at the model.

LYDIA
Where are you?  Help us!  Please.
Betelgeuse!

A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.


EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the
Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara
and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.
The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his
talons casually.

He speaks with a ghastly rasp.

BETELGEUSE
So... You're ready for me now?

LYDIA
You've got to help them.

BETELGEUSE
Can you help me?

LYDIA
(frightened)
... I will.

BETELGEUSE
Then I'll help them.  For a price.

He grins.

LYDIA
W... What is it?

BETELGEUSE
(his words echo
horribly
Be... my... queen!

LYDIA
(repulsed)
Your qu...?  But you're...

BETELGEUSE
(smiling devilishly)
I'm beeyoo-teeful.


ON LYDIA

She is chilled.  Steps back.
She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to
age.  Looks back to the model.

LYDIA
... All right... Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath
him...

LYDIA (V.O.)
(louder)
Betelgeuse...


WIDER ON GRAVEYARD

He doubles in size again.


ON LYDIA

She hesitates.


ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT

He looks up at her confidently.

LYDIA
Betelgeuse!


DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of
their ropes.

CHARLES
All right, that's enough.  Can you
stop this now?

Otho doesn't answer.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Otho?

OTHO
It's too late, Charles.  I'm
sorry.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.
There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,
rises from the center of the model town.


TIGHT ON HIS FACE

His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,
folks!

BETELGEUSE
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!


ON DEETZES

-- who have been focused on the Maitlands now turning
around to the model.


ON MODEL

Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival
Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the
model.

BETELGEUSE
Welcome to Winter River!


ANGLE

Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more
of the show.  Maxie follows.

BETELGEUSE
Hel LO Piggies!  Welcome to Winter
River!  See the Museum of Natural
Greed.  The Monument to Bored
Businessmen!  Come closer!


ANGLE

Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Their eyes grow wide.


TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS

They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,
huge sledgehammers.


ON BETELGEUSE

He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY
MUSIC UP.

BETELGEUSE
(roughly to the tune
of ""Santa Claus is
Coming to Town"")
You better not sell, you better
not buy...


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING
GAME STANDARD erects itself.


ON BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(still singing)
Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
makin'... you... fly.

Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and
Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.


ANGLE

BETELGEUSE
(in style of game
show host)
Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we
have here tonight?


ANGLE

He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.

BETELGEUSE
Let's have a hand for the
Maitlands, Barbara and Adam.  They
deserve a rest.


ON MAITLANDS

Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall
in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start
to regenerate themselves.

BETELGEUSE
Well, we'll get back to them after
they recover from their flight.


ON ADAM

Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.
Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.

BETELGEUSE
(looking around)
My God, what ugly wall dressing.
Who is responsible for all this
ugliness?
(spying Otho trying
to hide)
Otho, it's you!  Watch out for the
taste patrol!


ANGLE

He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-
man appears.

OTHO
No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio
Armani!

GIORGIO
Before youa getta started herea, I
joost wanta to saya, Otho,
don'ta weara my stuff?  Okay?
Youa too fat for human-type
clothes.  Ita makes my designs
looka like aircraft covering!


ANGLE

Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his
clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.
He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs
with delight then focuses on Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
Let's leave this crazy world
behind us.  I'll take you out in
style!

Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes
into an expressionist altar.


ANGLE

His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in
step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.


ANGLE

Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by
these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and
sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.
Lydia screams!!

BARBARA
No... No!

Adam's eyes widen.

LYDIA
(frightened, but
hurling the incan-
tation to make him
disappear)
No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...

Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.
Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.

DELIA
(frantic)
Please, can't you do something!
Please!



ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --
but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to
help him reattach it.

Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
You know if we're going to get
married, we're going to need
witnesses!

Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.
From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life
and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist
around them, forcing them to watch the hideous
spectacle.

Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the
ceremony begins.


A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER

slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the
service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.

PREACHER
Do you, Betel...

His mouth drops and is frozen.

BETELGEUSE
Uh-uh!  No one says the B word!

PREACHER
Do you, _____________, take this
woman to be your wedded wife?  To
honor...

BETELGEUSE
(interrupting)
You betcha!

Lydia screams and struggles.

PREACHER
And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take
this man?... er, uh... man... to
be your lawful wedded husband?...
In sickness...

Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.

BETELGEUSE
You don't have to answer him,
snookums.  I'll do it for you.
(eerily, speaking in
her voice)
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound
mind.  The man next to me is the
one I want.  You asked me... I'm
answering.  Yes.  How I love that
man of mine.

Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He
shouts the incantation.

ADAM
Beetle...


ANGLE

Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,
Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his
mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,
musters up his ghost powers and --

ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue
shouting...

TEETH
Beetleju...


ANGLE

Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.

BETELGEUSE
(angrily, to old man)
Now move it, pops!


ON ADAM

Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,
ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.


ON ADAM

He has been zapped into his model town.


ANGLE

Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.

BARBARA
Beetlegeuse...

Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.


ON BARBARA

A gag comes over her mouth.


ON MODEL

Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of
the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow
and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to
do.


ON BARBARA

She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say
his name again...

BARBARA
Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

More angry, he waves his hand.


ON BARBARA

Her lips are zippered shut.


IN MODEL

Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the
truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and
tries to start it.


ON BARBARA

She unzips her mouth and tries again.

BARBARA
Be


ON BETELGEUSE

Fire darts from his eyes....


ON BARBARA

A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.
She screams wordlessly behind it.


IN MODEL

Adam finally gets the truck started.


BARBARA

Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking
point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the
window and CRASHES through into the night.


IN MODEL

Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at
Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last
shot.


BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(angry)
Now, let's get rolling!

PREACHER
Then, by the authority vested in
me by...

A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the
Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.

BETELGEUSE
By me!  Get on with it!

LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.

PREACHER
Yes... by him.  I now pronounce
you man and...


ANGLE

The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam
bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's
foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,
then --


ON WINDOW

Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES
the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara
struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on
his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing
him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.


ANGLE

Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.
But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,
and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry
mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.

BETELGEUSE
Rrrrat shit!


ANGLE

Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down
through the floorboards of the house

Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.
Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.
Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.
The dust settles.

peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the
hole.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.
People stroll.


EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.
A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say
goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.

LYDIA
'Bye, Serena.  See you later.

Lydia walks along Main Street of Winter River.


EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane is getting out of her car -- Little Jane follows.

JANE
Hellooo!  How's school?

LYDIA
(not particularly
interested)
It's okay.  How's the dirt
business?

JANE
Well, I'm expecting a call from
your parents.  I have some news
for them.

Jane hears PHONE RING from inside, rushes in to answer it.

LYDIA
Tell them I'll call them tonight.


EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

Ernie polishes the lion.  Lydia passes.

LYDIA
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

He looks around, surprised.


INT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane screams into the phone.

JANE
What do you mean no?  After all
I've done for you.  I don't do
this for my health you know.

CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for
sale.

ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is
delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:
Fixer-Upper's Special.""

BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.

JANE
I have here a bona fide offer of
$250,000.00 for that dump.

Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE
irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at
Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her
papers into the air and exits.


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia
is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the
Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as
he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.

DELIA
(whisper to Charles)
It's Mrs. Butterworth again.

Charles picks up the extension.

CHARLES
Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
anyone looking at the house.  We
don't want it painted, the yard
mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do
we want it termite inspected.
It's not for sale.


INT. JANE'S STORE - DAY

Jane listens.  Silent.  Thinking.

JANE
Well.  Okay for now.  When will
you sell it?


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

DELIA
(smiles)
Never, honey.  Never.

She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.

DELIA
(continuing)
Some people never know when to
leave things the way they are.

Charles smiles.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

SOUND OF SWEEPING -- CAMERA eases up -- Barbara is
sweeping.  Adam working on his model.

ADAM
What time is it?

BARBARA
3:30 I guess.

ADAM
Give or take a year.

Barbara smiles.

The KITCHEN DOOR SLAMS.  Barbara looks up at Adam.
They smile.

ADAM
Did you get the paint?

LYDIA'S VOICE
I got it.  And I took pictures of
the new church for you, too.

BARBARA
How'd you do on the science test?

ON LYDIA

LYDIA
(hangs her head)
It was gross.  They wanted me to
dissect a frog.  I told them no
way.  I said it was against my
religion.  I got a C.

Adam frowns a little.

BARBARA
How did you do on the math test?

Lydia looks down coyly.

ADAM
We studied all day yesterday.
Don't tell me...

LYDIA
I got an A!

They grin with pride.

LYDIA
(continuing)
So can I?

ADAM
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C
on science.

LYDIA
Oh, go on...

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
never got an A in science in your
life!

ADAM
All right.

ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her
collar, ruffles her hair and waits.

ADAM
(continuing)
Okay.

Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.

She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy
Sledge:

LYDIA
""When a man loves a woman.
He can't keep his mind on nothin' else.""

Behind her ghostly images of the football players
appear as back-up.

FOOTBALLERS
Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.

LYDIA
He'd change the world for the good
thing he's found.  When a main
needs a woman, He cain't keep his
mind on nothin' else.  If she's
bad, he won't see it, she can do
no wrong.

MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:


ANGLE

A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the
roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.
Terrified, he scrambles to get out.


ON PILE

A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he
runs back out on the roof.


ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New
England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out
the window of the real house.

Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and
undeniably, the perfect haunted house.

You know where I wanna go?
Straight down the Mississippi River
To the Gulf of Mexico
To Lake Charles, Louisiana
Little Bessie, girl that I once knew
She told me just to come on by
If there's anything that she could do

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

[Verse 2: Mark Pellegrino]
Good luck had just stung me
And to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win
And I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor
I had him five to one
When that nag to win came around the track
Sure enough, we had won

If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

[Verse 3: Rob Benedict]
Well I took up all of my winnings
And I gave my little Bessie half
She tore it up and blew it in my face
Just for a laugh
Now there's just one thing in the whole wide world
I would like to see
That's when that little love of mine
She dips her doughnut in my tea

Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me
If I spring a leak, she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one

Now me and my mate we head back at the shack
We got Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings
But I love to hear him talk""

To the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull
My Bessie can't be beat
Oh Lord she can't

To go and see my Bessie again, yeah

34,Sunday Mornin',"[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, ooh, yeah, yeah...

Cause love is warmer in December

Till summer comes along
And in our winter world of love
You'll see we always will remember
That as the snow lay on the ground
We found our winter world of love

Because the nights are longer
We'll have the time to say such tender things before each day
And then, when love is stronger
Perhaps you'll give your heart and promise me we'll never part, oh no

And at the end of every year
I'll be so glad to have you near

We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take no trips on LSD;
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street
But, We love living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball;
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

Make you wanna sing, clap your hands to it
Nod your head a little bit, maybe dance to it
And reminisce about the good times you had to it
Not sure what I'd do if I never had music
I get inspired when I see the next man do it
Cause rappers say they're the truth, but they can't prove it
Little boys can't make grown man music
So I've got to show them and hold their hands through it
I never had a friend like the one I have in music
No matter how far I go, I come back to it
I do me, no matter what the track doing
And put my whole heart into it if I'm rapping to it
Cause this is soul music, I put my soul into it
This is what we lean on when we're going through it
If it's what you love, then hold on to it
Everybody hold tight so we don't lose it

It's in stores but it ain't something you could buy
The way it makes you feel, you wanna feel until you die
The soundtrack of the clouds in the bluest skies
So beautiful it brings tears to your eyes
Every note is a different color to the blind
Every song is a sentence and you're doing time
Mastery is the highest mountain you could climb
But at the peak, it might make you lose your mind
I know the danger but it's what I want to do in life
So if you're gonna do it, might as well do it right
And take you higher than you'd ever get by doing lines
On the ground but still feeling like you can fly

People wonderin' where in the fuck is Indo
Starin' at my screen, I need a fuckin' window
Yeah, cold out so I wear a mink coat
Damn, it feel good to be a boss
Eyes wide open like I'm smokin' on the rocks
Never spent bread even though I got a lot
Still like to rap even though I sing a lot
Money flipper, I'm earnin' burnin' Catalina wine mixer
Workin' out so much, you might just see me in the Sixers
I'm lookin' pretty good, you might just wanna hide your sisters
I put 'em in their feelings, get them listenin' to SZA
Top down, ass up, pussy so good got me doin' backflips
Vivid memories of her on my mattress
Damn it taste good, drink it from the cactus
Zero gravity in the room like NASA
All I hear is heartbeats goin' faster
Mention everything, fuck it it's the last song
Asked you a question, where's the fuckin' answer?

Everyday I gotta regulate, only thing you couldn't do was pray
Remind me of the pussy that I ate, hit 'em with another power play
Man, let’s face it, they don’t really listen to the music
They just want to take a trend and then go use it
Been a minute since I heard a lyric
That can move somebody and their feelings
I just started spittin' and I'm killin' it
I love these women I'm a feminist
I just talk and they call me a lyricist
I'ma make a debut album after this
It's the end, but I'm just getting started
Feel like the finale and the pilot's being friends
I'm the one and only
But I swear about a thousand Indonesian kids will come with me

Honey, you don't owe me anything because

[Chorus]
What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Verse 2]
You've given me so much warmth
I don't see how I could ever grow cold
In my room there's a picture of you and I
That nobody has a price to buy
I don't know what made you change your mind
But you'll be back, it's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
What you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Verse 3]
Into my life you came like a breath of spring
Given me a song to sing
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
And though I know you're leaving
I won't be grieving 'cause I know
Time has a way of showing us
The things we really need
And no matter where you go
I know you'll find your way back home
Oh baby, though I know it's not reality
You'll always be a part of me
Because what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last

[Outro]
I'm going to live once again
What you gave me
Is more than enough to last
I love you, I love you
Hey now, and what you gave me is more than enough to last
And what you gave me is more than enough to last",Marvin Gaye,1969,"[49, 50, 54, 73, 77]",5
48,Without Love (There Is Nothing),"[Verse 1]
I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gall, oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all

Without love I had nothing
Without love I had nothing at all
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have

There was nothing, oh that she would not give
I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live

Without love I had nothing
Without love I had nothing at all
I have conquered the world

Without love I had nothing at all

Without love I had nothing
Without love I had nothing at all
I have conquered the world

Without love I had nothing at all",Little Richard,1969,[50],1

58,Blistered/See Ruby Fall,"Shirley and Caroline

Shirley showed she had been sincere in saying she should be glad of Caroline's society, by frequently seeking it; and, indeed, if she had not sought it, she would not have had it, for Miss Helstone was slow to make fresh acquaintance. She was always held back by the idea that people could not want her, that she could not amuse them; and a brilliant, happy, youthful creature like the heiress of Fieldhead seemed to her too completely independent of society so uninteresting as hers ever to find it really welcome.

Shirley might be brilliant, and probably happy likewise, but no one is independent of genial society; and though in about a month she had made the acquaintance of most of the families round, and was on quite free and easy terms with all the Misses Sykes, and all the Misses Pearson, and the two superlative Misses Wynne of Walden Hall, yet, it appeared, she found none amongst them very genial: she fraternized with none of them, to use her own words. If she had had the bliss to be really Shirley Keeldar, Esq., lord of the manor of Briarfield, there was not a single fair one in this and the two neighbouring parishes whom she should have felt disposed to request to become Mrs. Keeldar, lady of the manor. This declaration she made to Mrs. Pryor, who received it very quietly, as she did most of her pupil's off-hand speeches, responding, ""My dear, do not allow that habit of alluding to yourself as a gentleman to be confirmed. It is a strange one. Those who do not know you, hearing you speak thus, would think you affected masculine manners.""

Shirley never laughed at her former governess; even the little formalities and harmless peculiarities of that lady were respectable in her eyes. Had it been otherwise, she would have proved herself a weak character at once; for it is only the weak who make a butt of quiet worth. Therefore she took her remonstrance in silence. She stood quietly near the window, looking at the grand cedar on her lawn watching a bird on one of its lower boughs. Presently she began to chirrup to the bird; soon her chirrup grew clearer; ere long she was whistling; the whistle struck into a tune, and very sweetly and deftly it was executed.

""My dear!"" expostulated Mrs. Pryor.

""Was I whistling?"" said Shirley. ""I forgot. I beg your pardon, ma'am. I had resolved to take care not to whistle before you.""

""But, Miss Keeldar, where did you learn to whistle? You must have got the habit since you came down into Yorkshire. I never knew you guilty of it before.""

""Oh! I learned to whistle a long while ago.""

""Who taught you?""

""No one. I took it up by listening, and I had laid it down again. But lately, yesterday evening, as I was coming up our lane, I heard a gentleman whistling that very tune in the field on the other side of the hedge, and that reminded me.""

""What gentleman was it?""

""We have only one gentleman in this region, ma'am, and that is Mr. Moore—at least he is the only gentleman who is not gray-haired. My two venerable favourites, Mr. Helstone and Mr. Yorke, it is true, are fine old beaus, infinitely better than any of the stupid young ones.""

Mrs. Pryor was silent.

""You do not like Mr. Helstone, ma'am?""

""My dear, Mr. Helstone's office secures him from criticism.""

""You generally contrive to leave the room when he is announced.""

""Do you walk out this morning, my dear?""

""Yes, I shall go to the rectory, and seek and find Caroline Helstone, and make her take some exercise. She shall have a breezy walk over Nunnely Common.""

""If you go in that direction, my dear, have the goodness to remind Miss Helstone to wrap up well, as there is a fresh wind, and she appears to me to require care.""

""You shall be minutely obeyed, Mrs. Pryor. Meantime, will you not accompany us yourself?""

""No, my love; I should be a restraint upon you. I am stout, and cannot walk so quickly as you would wish to do.""

Shirley easily persuaded Caroline to go with her, and when they were fairly out on the quiet road, traversing the extensive and solitary sweep of Nunnely Common, she as easily drew her into conversation. The first feelings of diffidence overcome, Caroline soon felt glad to talk with Miss Keeldar. The very first interchange of slight observations sufficed to give each an idea of what the other was. Shirley said she liked the green sweep of the common turf, and, better still, the heath on its ridges, for the heath reminded her of moors. She had seen moors when she was travelling on the borders near Scotland. She remembered particularly a district traversed one long afternoon, on a sultry but sunless day in summer. They journeyed from noon till sunset, over what seemed a boundless waste of deep heath, and nothing had they seen but wild sheep, nothing heard but the cries of wild birds.

""I know how the heath would look on such a day,"" said Caroline; ""purple-black—a deeper shade of the sky-tint, and that would be livid.""

""Yes, quite livid, with brassy edges to the clouds, and here and there a white gleam, more ghastly than the lurid tinge, which, as you looked at it, you momentarily expected would kindle into blinding lightning.""

""Did it thunder?""

""It muttered distant peals, but the storm did not break till evening, after we had reached our inn—that inn being an isolated house at the foot of a range of mountains.""

""Did you watch the clouds come down over the mountains?""

""I did. I stood at the window an hour watching them. The hills seemed rolled in a sullen mist, and when the rain fell in whitening sheets, suddenly they were blotted from the prospect; they were washed from the world.""

""I have seen such storms in hilly districts in Yorkshire; and at their riotous climax, while the sky was all cataract, the earth all flood, I have remembered the Deluge.""

""It is singularly reviving after such hurricanes to feel calm return, and from the opening clouds to receive a consolatory gleam, softly testifying that the sun is not quenched.""

""Miss Keeldar, just stand still now, and look down at Nunnely dale and wood.""

They both halted on the green brow of the common. They looked down on the deep valley robed in May raiment; on varied meads, some pearled with daisies, and some golden with king-cups. To-day all this young verdure smiled clear in sunlight; transparent emerald and amber gleams played over it. On Nunnwood—the sole remnant of antique British forest in a region whose lowlands were once all silvan chase, as its highlands were breast-deep heather—slept the shadow of a cloud; the distant hills were dappled, the horizon was shaded and tinted like mother-of-pearl; silvery blues, soft purples, evanescent greens and rose-shades, all melting into fleeces of white cloud, pure as azury snow, allured the eye as with a remote glimpse of heaven's foundations. The air blowing on the brow was fresh, and sweet, and bracing.

""Our England is a bonny island,"" said Shirley, ""and Yorkshire is one of her bonniest nooks.""

""You are a Yorkshire girl too?""

""I am—Yorkshire in blood and birth. Five generations of my race sleep under the aisles of Briarfield Church. I drew my first breath in the old black hall behind us.""

Hereupon Caroline presented her hand, which was accordingly taken and shaken. ""We are compatriots,"" said she.

""Yes,"" agreed Shirley, with a grave nod.

""And that,"" asked Miss Keeldar, pointing to the forest—""that is Nunnwood?""

""It is.""

""Were you ever there?""

""Many a time.""

""In the heart of it?""

""Yes.""

""What is it like?""

""It is like an encampment of forest sons of Anak. The trees are huge and old. When you stand at their roots, the summits seem in another region. The trunks remain still and firm as pillars, while the boughs sway to every breeze. In the deepest calm their leaves are never quite hushed, and in high wind a flood rushes, a sea thunders above you.""

""Was it not one of Robin Hood's haunts?""

""Yes, and there are mementos of him still existing. To penetrate into Nunnwood, Miss Keeldar, is to go far back into the dim days of old. Can you see a break in the forest, about the centre?""

""Yes, distinctly.""

""That break is a dell—a deep, hollow cup, lined with turf as green and short as the sod of this common. The very oldest of the trees, gnarled mighty oaks, crowd about the brink of this dell. In the bottom lie the ruins of a nunnery.""

""We will go—you and I alone, Caroline—to that wood, early some fine summer morning, and spend a long day there. We can take pencils and sketch-books, and any interesting reading book we like; and of course we shall take something to eat. I have two little baskets, in which Mrs. Gill, my housekeeper, might pack our provisions, and we could each carry our own. It would not tire you too much to walk so far?""

""Oh no; especially if we rested the whole day in the wood. And I know all the pleasantest spots. I know where we could get nuts in nutting time; I know where wild strawberries abound; I know certain lonely, quite untrodden glades, carpeted with strange mosses, some yellow as if gilded, some a sober gray, some gem-green. I know groups of trees that ravish the eye with their perfect, picture-like effects—rude oak, delicate birch, glossy beech, clustered in contrast; and ash trees stately as Saul, standing isolated; and superannuated wood-giants clad in bright shrouds of ivy. Miss Keeldar, I could guide you.""

""You would be dull with me alone?""

""I should not. I think we should suit; and what third person is there whose presence would not spoil our pleasure?""

""Indeed, I know of none about our own ages—no lady at least; and as to gentlemen——""

""An excursion becomes quite a different thing when there are gentlemen of the party,"" interrupted Caroline.

""I agree with you—quite a different thing to what we were proposing.""

""We were going simply to see the old trees, the old ruins; to pass a day in old times, surrounded by olden silence, and above all by quietude.""

""You are right; and the presence of gentlemen dispels the last charm, I think. If they are of the wrong sort, like your Malones, and your young Sykes, and Wynnes, irritation takes the place of serenity. If they are of the right sort, there is still a change; I can hardly tell what change—one easy to feel, difficult to describe.""

""We forget Nature, imprimis.""

""And then Nature forgets us, covers her vast calm brow with a dim veil, conceals her face, and withdraws the peaceful joy with which, if we had been content to worship her only, she would have filled our hearts.""

""What does she give us instead?""

""More elation and more anxiety; an excitement that steals the hours away fast, and a trouble that ruffles their course.""

""Our power of being happy lies a good deal in ourselves, I believe,"" remarked Caroline sagely. ""I have gone to Nunnwood with a large party—all the curates and some other gentry of these parts, together with sundry ladies—and I found the affair insufferably tedious and absurd; and I have gone quite alone, or accompanied but by Fanny, who sat in the woodman's hut and sewed, or talked to the goodwife, while I roamed about and made sketches, or read; and I have enjoyed much happiness of a quiet kind all day long. But that was when I was young—two years ago.""

""Did you ever go with your cousin, Robert Moore?""

""Yes; once.""

""What sort of a companion is he on these occasions?""

""A cousin, you know, is different to a stranger.""

""I am aware of that; but cousins, if they are stupid, are still more insupportable than strangers, because you cannot so easily keep them at a distance. But your cousin is not stupid?""

""No; but——""

""Well?""

""If the company of fools irritates, as you say, the society of clever men leaves its own peculiar pain also. Where the goodness or talent of your friend is beyond and above all doubt, your own worthiness to be his associate often becomes a matter of question.""

""Oh! there I cannot follow you. That crotchet is not one I should choose to entertain for an instant. I consider myself not unworthy to be the associate of the best of them—of gentlemen, I mean—though that is saying a great deal. Where they are good, they are very good, I believe. Your uncle, by-the-bye, is not a bad specimen of the elderly gentleman. I am always glad to see his brown, keen, sensible old face, either in my own house or any other. Are you fond of him? Is he kind to you? Now, speak the truth.""

""He has brought me up from childhood, I doubt not, precisely as he would have brought up his own daughter, if he had had one; and that is kindness. But I am not fond of him. I would rather be out of his presence than in it.""

""Strange, when he has the art of making himself so agreeable.""

""Yes, in company; but he is stern and silent at home. As he puts away his cane and shovel-hat in the rectory hall, so he locks his liveliness in his book-case and study-desk: the knitted brow and brief word for the fireside; the smile, the jest, the witty sally for society.""

""Is he tyrannical?""

""Not in the least. He is neither tyrannical nor hypocritical. He is simply a man who is rather liberal than good-natured, rather brilliant than genial, rather scrupulously equitable than truly just—if you can understand such superfine distinctions.""

""Oh yes! Good-nature implies indulgence, which he has not; geniality, warmth of heart, which he does not own; and genuine justice is the offspring of sympathy and considerateness, of which, I can well conceive, my bronzed old friend is quite innocent.""

""I often wonder, Shirley, whether most men resemble my uncle in their domestic relations; whether it is necessary to be new and unfamiliar to them in order to seem agreeable or estimable in their eyes; and whether it is impossible to their natures to retain a constant interest and affection for those they see every day.""

""I don't know. I can't clear up your doubts. I ponder over similar ones myself sometimes. But, to tell you a secret, if I were convinced that they are necessarily and universally different from us—fickle, soon petrifying, unsympathizing—I would never marry. I should not like to find out that what I loved did not love me, that it was weary of me, and that whatever effort I might make to please would hereafter be worse than useless, since it was inevitably in its nature to change and become indifferent. That discovery once made, what should I long for? To go away, to remove from a presence where my society gave no pleasure.""

""But you could not if you were married.""

""No, I could not. There it is. I could never be my own mistress more. A terrible thought! It suffocates me! Nothing irks me like the idea of being a burden and a bore—an inevitable burden, a ceaseless bore! Now, when I feel my company superfluous, I can comfortably fold my independence round me like a mantle, and drop my pride like a veil, and withdraw to solitude. If married, that could not be.""

""I wonder we don't all make up our minds to remain single,"" said Caroline. ""We should if we listened to the wisdom of experience. My uncle always speaks of marriage as a burden; and I believe whenever he hears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool, or, at any rate, as doing a foolish thing.""

""But, Caroline, men are not all like your uncle. Surely not. I hope not.""

She paused and mused.

""I suppose we each find an exception in the one we love, till we are married,"" suggested Caroline.

""I suppose so. And this exception we believe to be of sterling materials. We fancy it like ourselves; we imagine a sense of harmony. We think his voice gives the softest, truest promise of a heart that will never harden against us; we read in his eyes that faithful feeling—affection. I don't think we should trust to what they call passion at all, Caroline. I believe it is a mere fire of dry sticks, blazing up and vanishing. But we watch him, and see him kind to animals, to little children, to poor people. He is kind to us likewise, good, considerate. He does not flatter women, but he is patient with them, and he seems to be easy in their presence, and to find their company genial. He likes them not only for vain and selfish reasons, but as we like him—because we like him. Then we observe that he is just, that he always speaks the truth, that he is conscientious. We feel joy and peace when he comes into a room; we feel sadness and trouble when he leaves it. We know that this man has been a kind son, that he is a kind brother. Will any one dare to tell me that he will not be a kind husband?""

""My uncle would affirm it unhesitatingly. 'He will be sick of you in a month,' he would say.""

""Mrs. Pryor would seriously intimate the same.""

""Mrs. Yorke and Miss Mann would darkly suggest ditto.""

""If they are true oracles, it is good never to fall in love.""

""Very good, if you can avoid it.""

""I choose to doubt their truth.""

""I am afraid that proves you are already caught.""

""Not I. But if I were, do you know what soothsayers I would consult?""

""Let me hear.""

""Neither man nor woman, elderly nor young: the little Irish beggar that comes barefoot to my door; the mouse that steals out of the cranny in the wainscot; the bird that in frost and snow pecks at my window for a crumb; the dog that licks my hand and sits beside my knee.""

""Did you ever see any one who was kind to such things?""

""Did you ever see any one whom such things seemed instinctively to follow, like, rely on?""

""We have a black cat and an old dog at the rectory. I know somebody to whose knee that black cat loves to climb, against whose shoulder and cheek it likes to purr. The old dog always comes out of his kennel and wags his tail, and whines affectionately when somebody passes.""

""And what does that somebody do?""

""He quietly strokes the cat, and lets her sit while he conveniently can; and when he must disturb her by rising, he puts her softly down, and never flings her from him roughly. He always whistles to the dog and gives him a caress.""

""Does he? It is not Robert?""

""But it is Robert.""

""Handsome fellow!"" said Shirley, with enthusiasm. Her eyes sparkled.

""Is he not handsome? Has he not fine eyes and well-cut features, and a clear, princely forehead?""

""He has all that, Caroline. Bless him! he is both graceful and good.""

""I was sure you would see that he was. When I first looked at your face I knew you would.""

""I was well inclined to him before I saw him. I liked him when I did see him. I admire him now. There is charm in beauty for itself, Caroline; when it is blent with goodness, there is a powerful charm.""

""When mind is added, Shirley?""

""Who can resist it?""

""Remember my uncle, Mesdames Pryor, Yorke, and Mann.""

""Remember the croaking of the frogs of Egypt. He is a noble being. I tell you when they are good they are the lords of the creation—they are the sons of God. Moulded in their Maker's image, the minutest spark of His spirit lifts them almost above mortality. Indisputably, a great, good, handsome man is the first of created things.""

""Above us?""

""I would scorn to contend for empire with him—I would scorn it. Shall my left hand dispute for precedence with my right? Shall my heart quarrel with my pulse? Shall my veins be jealous of the blood which fills them?""

""Men and women, husbands and wives, quarrel horribly, Shirley.""

""Poor things! Poor, fallen, degenerate things! God made them for another lot, for other feelings.""

""But are we men's equals, or are we not?""

""Nothing ever charms me more than when I meet my superior—one who makes me sincerely feel that he is my superior.""

""Did you ever meet him?""

""I should be glad to see him any day. The higher above me, so much the better. It degrades to stoop; it is glorious to look up. What frets me is, that when I try to esteem, I am baffled; when religiously inclined, there are but false gods to adore. I disdain to be a pagan.""

""Miss Keeldar, will you come in? We are here at the rectory gates.""

""Not to-day, but to-morrow I shall fetch you to spend the evening with me. Caroline Helstone, if you really are what at present to me you seem, you and I will suit. I have never in my whole life been able to talk to a young lady as I have talked to you this morning. Kiss me—and good-bye.""

Mrs. Pryor seemed as well disposed to cultivate Caroline's acquaintance as Shirley. She, who went nowhere else, called on an early day at the rectory. She came in the afternoon, when the rector happened to be out. It was rather a close day; the heat of the weather had flushed her, and she seemed fluttered too by the circumstance of entering a strange house, for it appeared her habits were most retiring and secluded. When Miss Helstone went to her in the dining-room she found her seated on the sofa, trembling, fanning herself with her handkerchief, and seeming to contend with a nervous discomposure that threatened to become hysterical.

Caroline marvelled somewhat at this unusual want of self-command in a lady of her years, and also at the lack of real strength in one who appeared almost robust—for Mrs. Pryor hastened to allege the fatigue of her walk, the heat of the sun, etc., as reasons for her temporary indisposition; and still as, with more hurry than coherence, she again and again enumerated these causes of exhaustion, Caroline gently sought to relieve her by opening her shawl and removing her bonnet. Attentions of this sort Mrs. Pryor would not have accepted from every one. In general she recoiled from touch or close approach with a mixture of embarrassment and coldness far from flattering to those who offered her aid. To Miss Helstone's little light hand, however, she yielded tractably, and seemed soothed by its contact. In a few minutes she ceased to tremble, and grew quiet and tranquil.

Her usual manner being resumed, she proceeded to talk of ordinary topics. In a miscellaneous company Mrs. Pryor rarely opened her lips, or, if obliged to speak, she spoke under restraint, and consequently not well; in dialogue she was a good converser. Her language, always a little formal, was well chosen; her sentiments were just; her information was varied and correct. Caroline felt it pleasant to listen to her, more pleasant than she could have anticipated.

On the wall opposite the sofa where they sat hung three pictures—the centre one, above the mantelpiece, that of a lady; the two others, male portraits.

""That is a beautiful face,"" said Mrs. Pryor, interrupting a brief pause which had followed half an hour's animated conversation. ""The features may be termed perfect; no statuary's chisel could improve them. It is a portrait from the life, I presume?""

""It is a portrait of Mrs. Helstone.""

""Of Mrs. Matthewson Helstone? Of your uncle's wife?""

""It is, and is said to be a good likeness. Before her marriage she was accounted the beauty of the district.""

""I should say she merited the distinction. What accuracy in all the lineaments! It is, however, a passive face. The original could not have been what is generally termed 'a woman of spirit.'""

""I believe she was a remarkably still, silent person.""

""One would scarcely have expected, my dear, that your uncle's choice should have fallen on a partner of that description. Is he not fond of being amused by lively chat?""

""In company he is. But he always says he could never do with a talking wife. He must have quiet at home. You go out to gossip, he affirms; you come home to read and reflect.""

""Mrs. Matthewson lived but a few years after her marriage, I think I have heard?""

""About five years.""

""Well, my dear,"" pursued Mrs. Pryor, rising to go, ""I trust it is understood that you will frequently come to Fieldhead. I hope you will. You must feel lonely here, having no female relative in the house; you must necessarily pass much of your time in solitude.""

""I am inured to it. I have grown up by myself. May I arrange your shawl for you?""

Mrs. Pryor submitted to be assisted.

""Should you chance to require help in your studies,"" she said, ""you may command me.""

Caroline expressed her sense of such kindness.

""I hope to have frequent conversations with you. I should wish to be of use to you.""

Again Miss Helstone returned thanks. She thought what a kind heart was hidden under her visitor's seeming chilliness. Observing that Mrs. Pryor again glanced with an air of interest towards the portraits, as she walked down the room, Caroline casually explained: ""The likeness that hangs near the window, you will see, is my uncle, taken twenty years ago; the other, to the left of the mantelpiece, is his brother James, my father.""

""They resemble each other in some measure,"" said Mrs. Pryor; ""yet a difference of character may be traced in the different mould of the brow and mouth.""

""What difference?"" inquired Caroline, accompanying her to the door. ""James Helstone—that is, my father—is generally considered the best-looking of the two. Strangers, I remark, always exclaim, 'What a handsome man!' Do you think his picture handsome, Mrs. Pryor?""

""It is much softer or finer featured than that of your uncle.""

""But where or what is the difference of character to which you alluded? Tell me. I wish to see if you guess right.""

""My dear, your uncle is a man of principle. His forehead and his lips are firm, and his eye is steady.""

""Well, and the other? Do not be afraid of offending me. I always like the truth.""

""Do you like the truth? It is well for you. Adhere to that preference—never swerve thence. The other, my dear, if he had been living now, would probably have furnished little support to his daughter. It is, however, a graceful head—taken in youth, I should think. My dear"" (turning abruptly), ""you acknowledge an inestimable value in principle?""

""I am sure no character can have true worth without it.""

""You feel what you say? You have considered the subject?""

""Often. Circumstances early forced it upon my attention.""

""The lesson was not lost, then, though it came so prematurely. I suppose the soil is not light nor stony, otherwise seed falling in that season never would have borne fruit. My dear, do not stand in the air of the door; you will take cold. Good-afternoon.""

Miss Helstone's new acquaintance soon became of value to her: their society was acknowledged a privilege. She found she would have been in error indeed to have let slip this chance of relief, to have neglected to avail herself of this happy change. A turn was thereby given to her thoughts; a new channel was opened for them, which, diverting a few of them at least from the one direction in which all had hitherto tended, abated the impetuosity of their rush, and lessened the force of their pressure on one worn-down point.

Soon she was content to spend whole days at Fieldhead, doing by turns whatever Shirley or Mrs. Pryor wished her to do; and now one would claim her, now the other. Nothing could be less demonstrative than the friendship of the elder lady, but also nothing could be more vigilant, assiduous, untiring. I have intimated that she was a peculiar personage, and in nothing was her peculiarity more shown than in the nature of the interest she evinced for Caroline. She watched all her movements; she seemed as if she would have guarded all her steps. It gave her pleasure to be applied to by Miss Helstone for advice and assistance. She yielded her aid, when asked, with such quiet yet obvious enjoyment that Caroline ere long took delight in depending on her.

Shirley Keeldar's complete docility with Mrs. Pryor had at first surprised Miss Helstone, and not less the fact of the reserved ex-governess being so much at home and at ease in the residence of her young pupil, where she filled with such quiet independency a very dependent post; but she soon found that it needed but to know both ladies to comprehend fully the enigma. Every one, it seemed to her, must like, must love, must prize Mrs. Pryor when they knew her. No matter that she perseveringly wore old-fashioned gowns; that her speech was formal and her manner cool; that she had twenty little ways such as nobody else had: she was still such a stay, such a counsellor, so truthful, so kind in her way, that, in Caroline's idea, none once accustomed to her presence could easily afford to dispense with it.

As to dependency or humiliation, Caroline did not feel it in her intercourse with Shirley, and why should Mrs. Pryor? The heiress was rich—very rich—compared with her new friend: one possessed a clear thousand a year, the other not a penny; and yet there was a safe sense of equality experienced in her society, never known in that of the ordinary Briarfield and Whinbury gentry.

The reason was, Shirley's head ran on other things than money and position. She was glad to be independent as to property; by fits she was even elated at the notion of being lady of the manor, and having tenants and an estate. She was especially tickled with an agreeable complacency when reminded of ""all that property"" down in the Hollow, ""comprising an excellent cloth-mill, dyehouse, warehouse, together with the messuage, gardens, and outbuildings, termed Hollow's Cottage;"" but her exultation being quite undisguised was singularly inoffensive; and, for her serious thoughts, they tended elsewhere. To admire the great, reverence the good, and be joyous with the genial, was very much the bent of Shirley's soul: she mused, therefore, on the means of following this bent far oftener than she pondered on her social superiority.

In Caroline Miss Keeldar had first taken an interest because she was quiet, retiring, looked delicate, and seemed as if she needed some one to take care of her. Her predilection increased greatly when she discovered that her own way of thinking and talking was understood and responded to by this new acquaintance. She had hardly expected it. Miss Helstone, she fancied, had too pretty a face, manners and voice too soft, to be anything out of the common way in mind and attainments; and she very much wondered to see the gentle features light up archly to the reveille of a dry sally or two risked by herself; and more did she wonder to discover the self-won knowledge treasured, and the untaught speculations working in that girlish, curl-veiled head. Caroline's instinct of taste, too, was like her own. Such books as Miss Keeldar had read with the most pleasure were Miss Helstone's delight also. They held many aversions too in common, and could have the comfort of laughing together over works of false sentimentality and pompous pretension.

Few, Shirley conceived, men or women have the right taste in poetry, the right sense for discriminating between what is real and what is false. She had again and again heard very clever people pronounce this or that passage, in this or that versifier, altogether admirable, which, when she read, her soul refused to acknowledge as anything but cant, flourish, and tinsel, or at the best elaborate wordiness, curious, clever, learned, perhaps, haply even tinged with the fascinating hues of fancy, but, God knows, as different from real poetry as the gorgeous and massy vase of mosaic is from the little cup of pure metal; or, to give the reader a choice of similes, as the milliner's artificial wreath is from the fresh-gathered lily of the field.

Caroline, she found, felt the value of the true ore, and knew the deception of the flashy dross. The minds of the two girls being toned in harmony often chimed very sweetly together.

One evening they chanced to be alone in the oak-parlour. They had passed a long wet day together without ennui. It was now on the edge of dark; candles were not yet brought in; both, as twilight deepened, grew meditative and silent. A western wind roared high round the hall, driving wild clouds and stormy rain up from the far-remote ocean; all was tempest outside the antique lattices, all deep peace within. Shirley sat at the window, watching the rack in heaven, the mist on earth, listening to certain notes of the gale that plained like restless spirits—notes which, had she not been so young, gay, and healthy, would have swept her trembling nerves like some omen, some anticipatory dirge. In this her prime of existence and bloom of beauty they but subdued vivacity to pensiveness. Snatches of sweet ballads haunted her ear; now and then she sang a stanza. Her accents obeyed the fitful impulse of the wind; they swelled as its gusts rushed on, and died as they wandered away. Caroline, withdrawn to the farthest and darkest end of the room, her figure just discernible by the ruby shine of the flameless fire, was pacing to and fro, muttering to herself fragments of well-remembered poetry. She spoke very low, but Shirley heard her; and while singing softly, she listened. This was the strain:—

        ""Obscurest night involved the sky,
        The Atlantic billows roared,
        When such a destined wretch as I,
        Washed headlong from on board,
        Of friends, of hope, of all bereft,
        His floating home for ever left.""

Here the fragment stopped, because Shirley's song, erewhile somewhat full and thrilling, had become delicately faint.

""Go on,"" said she.

""Then you go on too. I was only repeating 'The Castaway.'""

""I know. If you can remember it all, say it all.""

And as it was nearly dark, and, after all, Miss Keeldar was no formidable auditor, Caroline went through it. She went through it as she should have gone through it. The wild sea, the drowning mariner, the reluctant ship swept on in the storm, you heard were realized by her; and more vividly was realized the heart of the poet, who did not weep for ""The Castaway,"" but who, in an hour of tearless anguish, traced a semblance to his own God-abandoned misery in the fate of that man-forsaken sailor, and cried from the depths where he struggled,—

        ""No voice divine the storm allayed,
        No light propitious shone,
        When, snatched from all effectual aid,
        We perished—each alone!
        But I beneath a rougher sea,
        And whelmed in deeper gulfs than he.""
        ""I hope William Cowper is safe and calm in heaven now,"" said Caroline.

""Do you pity what he suffered on earth?"" asked Miss Keeldar.

""Pity him, Shirley? What can I do else? He was nearly broken-hearted when he wrote that poem, and it almost breaks one's heart to read it. But he found relief in writing it—I know he did; and that gift of poetry—the most divine bestowed on man—was, I believe, granted to allay emotions when their strength threatens harm. It seems to me, Shirley, that nobody should write poetry to exhibit intellect or attainment. Who cares for that sort of poetry? Who cares for learning—who cares for fine words in poetry? And who does not care for feeling—real feeling—however simply, even rudely expressed?""

""It seems you care for it, at all events; and certainly, in hearing that poem, one discovers that Cowper was under an impulse strong as that of the wind which drove the ship—an impulse which, while it would not suffer him to stop to add ornament to a single stanza, filled him with force to achieve the whole with consummate perfection. You managed to recite it with a steady voice, Caroline. I wonder thereat.""

""Cowper's hand did not tremble in writing the lines. Why should my voice falter in repeating them? Depend on it, Shirley, no tear blistered the manuscript of 'The Castaway.' I hear in it no sob of sorrow, only the cry of despair; but, that cry uttered, I believe the deadly spasm passed from his heart, that he wept abundantly, and was comforted.""

Shirley resumed her ballad minstrelsy. Stopping short, she remarked ere long, ""One could have loved Cowper, if it were only for the sake of having the privilege of comforting him.""

""You never would have loved Cowper,"" rejoined Caroline promptly. ""He was not made to be loved by woman.""

""What do you mean?""

""What I say. I know there is a kind of natures in the world—and very noble, elevated natures too—whom love never comes near. You might have sought Cowper with the intention of loving him, and you would have looked at him, pitied him, and left him, forced away by a sense of the impossible, the incongruous, as the crew were borne from their drowning comrade by 'the furious blast.'""

""You may be right. Who told you this?""

""And what I say of Cowper, I should say of Rousseau. Was Rousseau ever loved? He loved passionately; but was his passion ever returned? I am certain, never. And if there were any female Cowpers and Rousseaus, I should assert the same of them.""

""Who told you this, I ask? Did Moore?""

""Why should anybody have told me? Have I not an instinct? Can I not divine by analogy? Moore never talked to me either about Cowper, or Rousseau, or love. The voice we hear in solitude told me all I know on these subjects.""

""Do you like characters of the Rousseau order, Caroline?""

""Not at all, as a whole. I sympathize intensely with certain qualities they possess. Certain divine sparks in their nature dazzle my eyes, and make my soul glow. Then, again, I scorn them. They are made of clay and gold. The refuse and the ore make a mass of weakness: taken altogether, I feel them unnatural, unhealthy, repulsive.""

""I dare say I should be more tolerant of a Rousseau than you would, Cary. Submissive and contemplative yourself, you like the stern and the practical. By the way, you must miss that Cousin Robert of yours very much, now that you and he never meet.""

""I do.""

""And he must miss you?""

""That he does not.""

""I cannot imagine,"" pursued Shirley, who had lately got a habit of introducing Moore's name into the conversation, even when it seemed to have no business there—""I cannot imagine but that he was fond of you, since he took so much notice of you, talked to you, and taught you so much.""

""He never was fond of me; he never professed to be fond of me. He took pains to prove that he only just tolerated me.""

Caroline, determined not to err on the flattering side in estimating her cousin's regard for her, always now habitually thought of it and mentioned it in the most scanty measure. She had her own reasons for being less sanguine than ever in hopeful views of the future, less indulgent to pleasurable retrospections of the past.

""Of course, then,"" observed Miss Keeldar, ""you only just tolerated him in return?""

""Shirley, men and women are so different; they are in such a different position. Women have so few things to think about, men so many. You may have a friendship for a man, while he is almost indifferent to you. Much of what cheers your life may be dependent on him, while not a feeling or interest of moment in his eyes may have reference to you. Robert used to be in the habit of going to London, sometimes for a week or a fortnight together. Well, while he was away, I found his absence a void. There was something wanting; Briarfield was duller. Of course, I had my usual occupations; still I missed him. As I sat by myself in the evenings, I used to feel a strange certainty of conviction I cannot describe, that if a magician or a genius had, at that moment, offered me Prince Ali's tube (you remember it in the 'Arabian Nights'?), and if, with its aid, I had been enabled to take a view of Robert—to see where he was, how occupied—I should have learned, in a startling manner, the width of the chasm which gaped between such as he and such as I. I knew that, however my thoughts might adhere to him, his were effectually sundered from me.""

""Caroline,"" demanded Miss Keeldar abruptly, ""don't you wish you had a profession—a trade?""

""I wish it fifty times a day. As it is, I often wonder what I came into the world for. I long to have something absorbing and compulsory to fill my head and hands and to occupy my thoughts.""

""Can labour alone make a human being happy?""

""No; but it can give varieties of pain, and prevent us from breaking our hearts with a single tyrant master-torture. Besides, successful labour has its recompense; a vacant, weary, lonely, hopeless life has none.""

""But hard labour and learned professions, they say, make women masculine, coarse, unwomanly.""

""And what does it signify whether unmarried and never-to-be-married women are unattractive and inelegant or not? Provided only they are decent, decorous, and neat, it is enough. The utmost which ought to be required of old maids, in the way of appearance, is that they should not absolutely offend men's eyes as they pass them in the street; for the rest, they should be allowed, without too much scorn, to be as absorbed, grave, plain-looking, and plain-dressed as they please.""

""You might be an old maid yourself, Caroline, you speak so earnestly.""

""I shall be one. It is my destiny. I will never marry a Malone or a Sykes; and no one else will ever marry me.""

Here fell a long pause. Shirley broke it. Again the name by which she seemed bewitched was almost the first on her lips.

""Lina—did not Moore call you Lina sometimes?""

""Yes. It is sometimes used as the abbreviation of Caroline in his native country.""

""Well, Lina, do you remember my one day noticing an inequality in your hair—a curl wanting on that right side—and your telling me that it was Robert's fault, as he had once cut therefrom a long lock?""

""Yes.""

""If he is, and always was, as indifferent to you as you say, why did he steal your hair?""

""I don't know—yes, I do. It was my doing, not his. Everything of that sort always was my doing. He was going from home—to London, as usual; and the night before he went, I had found in his sister's workbox a lock of black hair—a short, round curl. Hortense told me it was her brother's, and a keepsake. He was sitting near the table. I looked at his head. He has plenty of hair; on the temples were many such round curls. I thought he could spare me one. I knew I should like to have it, and I asked for it. He said, on condition that he might have his choice of a tress from my head. So he got one of my long locks of hair, and I got one of his short ones. I keep his, but I dare say he has lost mine. It was my doing, and one of those silly deeds it distresses the heart and sets the face on fire to think of; one of those small but sharp recollections that return, lacerating your self-respect like tiny penknives, and forcing from your lips, as you sit alone, sudden, insane-sounding interjections.""

""Caroline!""

""I do think myself a fool, Shirley, in some respects; I do despise myself. But I said I would not make you my confessor, for you cannot reciprocate foible for foible; you are not weak. How steadily you watch me now! Turn aside your clear, strong, she-eagle eye; it is an insult to fix it on me thus.""

""What a study of character you are—weak, certainly, but not in the sense you think!—Come in!""

This was said in answer to a tap at the door. Miss Keeldar happened to be near it at the moment, Caroline at the other end of the room. She saw a note put into Shirley's hands, and heard the words, ""From Mr. Moore, ma'am.""

""Bring candles,"" said Miss Keeldar.

Caroline sat expectant.

""A communication on business,"" said the heiress; but when candles were brought, she neither opened nor read it. The rector's Fanny was presently announced, and the rector's niece went home.",Charlotte Brontë,1969,"[60, 52, 50, 50, 69, 100]",6

60,One Tin Soldier,"Listen children to a story
That was written long ago
About a kingdom on a mountain
And the valley folk below
On the mountain was a treasure
Buried deep beneath a stone
And the valley people swore
They'd have it for their very own

Go ahead and hate your neighbour
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
Justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgement day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

So the people of the valley
Sent a message up the hill
Asking for the buried treasure
Tons of gold for which they'd kill
Came an answer from the kingdom
""With our brothers we will share
All the secrets of our mountain
All the riches buried there""

Now the valley cried with anger
""Mount your horses, draw your sword""
And they killed the mountain people
So they won their just reward
Now they stood beside the treasure
On the mountain darkend red
Turned the stone and looked beneath it
""Peace on earth"" was all it said

Go ahead and hate your neighbour
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgement day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away

Go ahead and hate your neighbour
Go ahead and cheat a friend
Do it in the name of heaven
You can justify it in the end
There won't be any trumpets blowing
Come the judgement day
On the bloody morning after
One tin soldier rides away",The Original Caste,1969,"[62, 63, 70, 76, 88, 96, 99]",7
61,When Julie Comes Around,"A poem with no rhyme
A clock without time
A ship without sails
Just drifting on the water
That's just how I feel
Whenever she's gone
That's just how I feel
My life's unreal, but I go on (and on, and on)

I wait till Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
She smiles a gentle smile
And suddenly I get that feeling, and then
I'm inside out with love
'Cause Julie's come around again

She's just like a bird
She follows the sun
She spread out her wings
And once again she leaves me
It's always the same
I'm broken in two
But after a while
I always know what I must do

I wait till Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
She smiles a gentle smile
And suddenly I get that feeling, and then
I'm inside out with love
'Cause Julie's come around again

When Julie comes around
And sings a happy song of summer
And lifts my spirit up
And fills my foolish mind with wonder
When Julie comes around",The Cuff Links,1969,"[63, 71, 90]",3

Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it

Baby if you try
Baby take me in your arms

If loving yous a crime
Then I guess I'm guilty every time
And I always will because this heart of mine needs you so

Maybe I'm a fool, but I don't know why you wanna play it cool
And my love is getting stronger, so don't be cruel, I need you so

Come on and take me in your arms and make me love you
Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it
There's really nothing to it
Baby if you try

Come on and take me in your arms and make me kiss you
Make me know how much I'm gonna miss you
Come along and do it
There's really nothing to it
Baby if you try
Come on, take me in your arms

I've just seen her face and the feeling that I've never felt inside
Makes this heart of mine just melt inside every time
And what can I do when I've tried so hard to get through to you
Somehow you won't let me steal into your heart

Come on and take me in your arms and make me love you
Make me know how much I'm thinking of you
Come along and do it, there's really nothing to it
Baby if you try

Come on and take me in your arms and make me kiss you

65,I'm So Glad I Fell For You,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday my life was filled with sadness
I had little hope of ever, ever finding gladness
All my roads were closed
And marked with never, never, nevermore
I had accepted my life to be just a bore
Whooohooohoooooo
All I did was sit at home
And watch and search for tomorrow
That was the only thing from life
That I thought I could just borrow
But now my life has changed
As the world turned, it's rearranged
'Cause I found sunshine, yes I did, ha
Had shone over the dark hill
Wooooooooww

Oh, I'm, I'm so glad, so glad, I fell for you
I wanna say I'm, I'm so glad, so glad I fell for you

'Cause you knew what, you know you knew what to do, baby
Oh yes you did

Fears of yesterday's battles, oh yeah

Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert

I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster

Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'

That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

24 hours from you
Counting the headlights, billboards and raindrops

Crossing the border, no danger can stop me
Oh Lord how I've been missing you

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love

I still remember that Sunday in Roseland
You came alone to the dance
I acted crazy to try and impress you
What did I know of romance
Two children searching for love and assurance
Each of us afraid in our own way

Tonight beneath the moon
One million dreams reach out to a star
Tonight I'll say a prayer
And tell the world how lucky we are
Tonight, to be in love

One mile to go
Oh the anticipation
Gonna hold you tight
Making love all night
Cause I know how you feel
Ya hate separation

73,Traces/Memories Medley,"What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?

Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.

Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?

Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.

Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?

Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.

Were their views on some points divergent?

Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.

Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?

The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.

Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?

In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.

What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?

He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.

As in what ways?

From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.

What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?

At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.

Was it there?

It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.

Why was he doubly irritated?

Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.

What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?

To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.

Bloom's decision?

A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.

Did he fall?

By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.

Did he rise uninjured by concussion?

Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.

What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?

Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.

Did the man reappear elsewhere?

Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.

Did Stephen obey his sign?

Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.

What did Bloom do?

He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.

Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?

Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.

What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?

Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.

What did Bloom see on the range?

On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.

What did Bloom do at the range?

He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.

Did it flow?

Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.

What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?

Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.

Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?

To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.

What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?

That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.

What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?

The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.

What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?

Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.

Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?

Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.

What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?

The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.

What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?

A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.

For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?

To shave himself.

What advantages attended shaving by night?

A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.

Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises

Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.

What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?

The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.

What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?

On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.

What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?

Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.

What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?

Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.

Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?

In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.

What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?

The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.

His mood?

He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.

What satisfied him?

To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.

How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?

He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.

What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?

Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).

Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?

His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.

Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?

The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.

Who drank more quickly?

Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.

What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?

Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.

Had he found their solution?

In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.

What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?

An ambition to squint
At my verses in print
Makes me hope that for these you'll find room.
If you so condescend
Then please place at the end
The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.

Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?

Name, age, race, creed.

What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?

Leopold Bloom

Ellpodbomool

Molldopeloob.

Bollo edoom

Old Ollebo, M. P.

What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?

Poets oft have sung in rhyme
Of music sweet their praise divine.
Let them hymn it nine times nine.
Dearer far than song or wine,
You are mine. The world is mine.

What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?

Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.

What relation existed between their ages?

16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.

What events might nullify these calculations?

The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.

How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?

Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.

Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?

Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.

Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?

Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.

Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?

He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.

Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?

Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.

What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?

The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.

Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?

The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.

Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?

Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.

Did either openly allude to their racial difference?

Neither.

What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?

He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.

What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?

Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).

Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?

Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.

Did they find their educational careers similar?

Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.

Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?

Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.

What two temperaments did they individually represent?

The scientific. The artistic.

What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?

Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.

Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?

Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.

What also stimulated him in his cogitations?

The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.

Such as?

K. 11. Kino's 111- Trousers.

House of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.

Such as not?

Look at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive gratis I pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed I candle power. Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot Street.

Bacilikil (Insect Powder).

Veribest (Boot Blacking).

Uwantit (Combined pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and pipecleaner).

Such as never?

What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?

Incomplete.

With it an abode of bliss.

Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz. pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.

Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?

His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.

What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?

Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary

What?

In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...

What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?

The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.

Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?

Coincidence.

Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?

He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.

Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?

It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.

Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?

What to do with our wives.

What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?

Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.

What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?

In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).

What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?

The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.

How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?

Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.

With what success had he attempted direct instruction?

She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.

What system had proved more effective?

Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.

Example?

She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.

Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?

Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).

What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?

That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.

Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?

Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).

What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?

By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).

By Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).

How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?

On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.

Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?

Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.

What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?

The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.

What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?

Kolod balejwaw pnimali
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.

Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?

In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.

How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.

In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?

The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).

Did the guest comply with his host's request?

Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.

What was Stephen's auditive sensation?

He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.

What was Bloom's visual sensation?

He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.

What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?

Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.

Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.

What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?

In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.

Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?

Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.

Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?

D Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
He broke the jew's windows all.

How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?

With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.

Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.

Then out there came the jew's daughter
And she all dressed in green.
`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
And play your ball again.'

`I can't come back and I won't come back
Without my schoolfellows all,
For if my master he did hear
He'd make it a sorry ball.'

She took him by the lilywhite hand
And led him along the hall
Until she led him to a room
Where none could hear him call.

She took a penknife out of her pocket
And cut off his little head,
And now he'll play his ball no more
For he lies among the dead.

How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?

With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.

Condense Stephen's commentary.
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.

Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?

He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.

Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?

In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.

Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?

He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.

From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?

From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.

Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?

Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.

What other infantile memories had he of her?

15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.

What endemic characteristics were present?

Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.

What memories had he of her adolescence?

She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).

Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?

Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.

What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?

A temporary departure of his cat.

Why similarly, why differently?

Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.

In other respects were their differences similar?

In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.

As?

Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.

In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?

As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.

In what manners did she reciprocate?

She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.

What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?

To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.

What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?

For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.

Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?

Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.

To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?

If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.

What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?

A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).

Was the proposal of asylum accepted?

Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.

What exchange of money took place between host and guest?

The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (œ1.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.

What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?

To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).

What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?

The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.

Was the clown Bloom's son?

No.

Had Bloom's coin returned?

Never.

Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?

Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.

He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?

There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.

Why did he desist from speculation?

Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.

Did Stephen participate in his dejection?

He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.

Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?

Not verbally. Substantially.

What comforted his misapprehension?

That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.

I n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?

Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM.
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN.

With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?

The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.

What did each do at the door of egress?

Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.

For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?

For a cat.

What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?

The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.

With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?

Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.

Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?

Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.

Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?

Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.

Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?

Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.

And the problem of possible redemption?
The minor was proved by the major.

Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?

The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.

His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?

That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.

Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?

Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.

Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?

It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.

What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?

Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.

What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?

In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.

How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?

With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.

Both then were silent?

Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.

Were they indefinitely inactive?

At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.

Similarly?

The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.

What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?

To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.

What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?

A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.

How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?

By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.

How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?

Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.

What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?

The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.

What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?

By Stephen:

Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.
Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.

By Bloom:

Heigho, heigho,
Heigho, heigho.

Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?

Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).

Alone, what did Bloom hear?

The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.

Alone, what did Bloom feel?

The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.

Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?

Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).

What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?

The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.

Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?

Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.

He remembered the initial paraphenomena?

More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.

Did he remain?

With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.

What suddenly arrested his ingress?

The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.

Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?

A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.

Describe them.

One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.

What significances attached to these two chairs?

Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.

What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?

A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.

With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?

With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.

His next proceeding?

From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.

What followed this operation?

That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.

What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?

A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.

What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?

In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.

What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?

The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.

Why solitary (ipsorelative)?

Brothers and sisters had he none,
Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.

Why mutable (aliorelative)?

From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.

What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?

The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?

The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.

Which volume was the largest in bulk?

Hozier's History of the Russo - Turkish War.

What among other data did the second volume of the work In question contain?

The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).

Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?

Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.

What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?

The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.

What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?

Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.

How was the irritation allayed?

He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.

What involuntary actions followed?

He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

Did the process of divestiture continue?

Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.

Why with satisfaction?

Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.

In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?

Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation #42), of grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on the other hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa, described as Rus in Urbe or Qui si Sana, but to purchase by private treaty in fee simple a thatched bungalowshaped 2 storey dwellinghouse of southerly aspect, surmounted by vane and lightning conductor, connected with the earth, with porch covered by parasitic plants (ivy or Virginia creeper), halldoor, olive green, with smart carriage finish and neat doorbrasses, stucco front with gilt tracery at eaves and gable, rising, if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable prospect from balcony with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and unoccupyable interjacent pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its own ground, at such a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not more than 5 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or Sutton, north, both localities equally reported by trial to resemble the terrestrial poles in being favourable climates for phthisical subjects), the premises to be held under feefarmgrant, lease 999 years, the message to consist of 1 drawingroom with baywindow (2 lancets), thermometer affixed, 1 sittingroom, 4 bedrooms, 2 servants rooms, tiled kitchen with close range and scullery, lounge hall fitted with linen wallpresses, fumed oak sectional bookcase containing the Encyclopaedia Britannica and New century Dictionary, transverse obsolete medieval and oriental weapons, dinner gong, alabaster lamp, bowl pendant, vulcanite automatic telephone receiver with adjacent directory, handtufted Axminster carpet with cream ground and trellis border, loo table with pillar and claw legs, hearth with massive firebrasses and ormolu mantel chronometer clock, guaranteed timekeeper with cathedral chime, barometer with hygrographic chart, comfortable lounge settees and corner fitments, upholstered in ruby plush with good springing and sunk centre, three banner Japanese screen and cuspidors (club style, rich wine-coloured leather, gloss renewable with a minimum of labour by use of linseed oil and vinegar) and pyramidically prismatic central chandelier lustre, bentwood perch with a fingertame parrot (expurgated language), embossed mural paper at 10/-per dozen with transverse swags of carmine floral design and top crown frieze, staircase, three continuous flights at successive right angles, of varnished cleargrained oak, treads and risers, newel, balusters and handrail, with stepped-up panel dado, dressed with camphorated wax, bathroom, hot and cold supply, reclining and shower: water closet on mezzanine provided with opaque singlepane oblong window, tipup seat, bracket lamp, brass tierod brace, armrests, footstool and artistic oleograph on inner face of door: ditto, plain: servant's apartments with separate sanitary and hygienic necessaries for cook, general and betweenmaid (salary, rising by biennial unearned increments of #2, with comprehensive fidelity insurance annual bonus (#1), and retiring allowance (based on the 65 system) after 30 years service), pantry, buttery, larder, refrigerator, outoffices, coal and wood cellarage with winebin (still and sparkling vintages) for distinguished guests, if entertained to dinner (evening dress), carbon monoxide gas supply throughout.

What additional attractions might the grounds contain?

As addenda, a tennis and fives court, a shrubbery, a glass summerhouse with tropical palms, equipped in the best botanical manner a rockery with waterspray, a beehive arranged on humane principles, oval flowerbeds in rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweat pea, lily of the valley (bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey (Limited) (wholesale and retail) seed and bulb merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper), an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements.

When citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their respective intermediate station or terminal. When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h).

What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?

Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.

Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?

In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.

What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?

Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations.

What lighter recreations?

Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.

Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?

Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.

What would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry?

Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (Semper paratus), duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).

What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?

A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.

Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.

To master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.

How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?

As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated.

What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase?

A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value: precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7-shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper perforate, Great Britain, 1866: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxembourg, 1878): antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of #5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d. to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d., 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 4d., 8d., 1s. 4d., 2s. 8d. to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium #1,000,000 sterling.

Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?

The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.15 by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035 the total population of Ireland according to the census returns of 1901.

Were there schemes of wider scope?

A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.

Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis?

Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiery (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.

What eventually would render him independent of such wealth?

The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.

For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?

It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.

His justifications?

As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.

What did he fear?

The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.

What were habitually his final meditations?

Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.

What did the first drawer unlocked contain?

A Vere Foster's handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent) Bloom, certain pages of which bore diagram drawings marked Papli, which showed a large globular head with 5 hairs erect, 2 eyes in profile, the trunk full front with 3 large buttons, 1 triangular foot: 2 fading photographs of queen Alexandra of England and of Maud Branscombe, actress and professional beauty: a Yuletide card, bearing on it a pictorial representation of a parasitic plant, the legend Mizpah, the date Xmas 1892, the name of the senders, from Mr and Mrs M.

What possibility suggested itself?

The possibility of exercising virile power of fascination in the most immediate future after an expensive repast in a private apartment in the company of an elegant courtesan, of corporal beauty, moderately mercenary, variously instructed, a lady by origin.

What did the 2nd drawer contain?

Documents: the birth certificate of Leopold Paula Bloom: an endowment assurance policy of #500 in the Scottish Widows' Assurance Society intestated Millicent (Milly) Bloom, coming into force at 25 years as with profit policy of #430, #462--10--0 and #500 at 60 years or death, 65 years or death and death, respectively, or with profit policy (paidup) of #299--10--0 together with cash payment of #133--10--0, at option: a bank passbook issued by the Ulster Bank, College Green branch showing statement of a/c for half year ending 31 December 1903, balance in depositor's favour: #18--14--6 (eighteen pounds, fourteen shillings and six pence, sterling), net personalty: certificate of possession of #900 Canadian 4% (inscribed) government stock (free of stamp duty): dockets of the Catholic Cemeteries' (Glasnevin) Committee, relative to a graveplot purchased: a local press cutting concerning change of name by deedpoll.

Quote the textual terms of this notice.

I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.

What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?

An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed To my Dear Son Leopold.

What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke?

Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always... of me... das Herr... Gott... dein...

What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?

An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.

Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?

Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.

As?

The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.

How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?

Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.

What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?

Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.

Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?

In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.

What idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?

Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.

What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?

The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.

What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?

The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.

Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.

Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.

With which attendant indignities?

The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.

By what could such a situation be precluded?

By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).

Which preferably?

The latter, by the line of least resistance.

What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?

Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.

What considerations rendered it not irrational?

The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.

What considerations rendered it desirable?

The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.

In Ireland?

The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.

Abroad?

Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.

Under what guidance, following what signs?

At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.

What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?

#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.

What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?

Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.

What tributes his?

Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.

Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?

Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.

What would render such return irrational?

An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.

What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?

The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.

What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?

The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).

What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?

The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).

What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?

The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.

What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?

Who was M'Intosh?

What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?

Where was Moses when the candle went out?

What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?

A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street.

What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?

The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.

What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?

Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.

What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?

A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).

What impersonal objects were perceived?

A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).

Bloom's acts?

He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.

How?

With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.

What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?

New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.

If he had smiled why would he have smiled?

To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.

What preceding series?

Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.

What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?

Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).

Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?

Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.

With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?

Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.

Envy?

Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.

Jealousy?

Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.

Abnegation?

In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.

Equanimity?

As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.

Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?

From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.

What retribution, if any?

Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.

By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?

The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.

In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?

Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.

The visible signs of antesatisfaction?

An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.

Then?

He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.

The visible signs of postsatisfaction?

A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.

What followed this silent action?

Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.

With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?

Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.

Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?

Absolutely.

Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?

Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.

What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?

By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.

How?

By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.

What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?

The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.

In what directions did listener and narrator lie?

Listener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45ø to the terrestrial equator.

In what state of rest or motion?

At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.

In what posture?

Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.

Womb? Weary?

He rests. He has travelled.

With?

Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.

When?

Going to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler.

And then we'll solve the mystery of laceration gravity
This riddle of revenge, please understand it has to be this way

Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

[Verse 2]
We've only got one​ chance to put this at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, ""We're not celebrities
We spark and fade, they die by threes""
I'll make you understand
And you can trade me for an apparition

[Chorus]
Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand and never

[Bridge]
Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh, how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying

Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up, fucking tall
Don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand
And never be afraid again

77,Is It Because I'm Black,"The dark brown shades of my skin, only add colour to my tears
That splash against my hollow bones, that rocks my soul
Looking back over my false dreams, that I once knew
Wondering why my dreams never came true

Is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me, what can I do
Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?
In this world of no pity
I was raised in the ghetto of the city
Momma, she works so hard
To earn every penny
Something is holding me back
Is it because I'm black?

Like a child stealing candy for the first time, and got caught
Thiefing around life's corner somewhere I got lost
Something is holding me back
I wonder, is it because I'm black?
Somebody tell me what can I do
Will I survive, or will I die?

You keep on holding me back
You keep on holding on
You keep on picking on me
You keep on holding me back
You keep on holding on
You keep on holding on
You're holding me back
I wonder why, you do me like that
But you keep on holding me back
You keep on putting your foot on me
But I, I've got to break away
Somehow and someday
'Cause I wanna be somebody so bad, so bad
I wanna be somebody, I wanna be somebody so bad
You see, I want diamond rings and things, like you do
And I wanna drive Cadillac cars
I wanna be somebody so bad
But you keep on putting your foot on me
And I, I believe, I believe I can break away
And be somebody, somehow, and someway

Ya see, I heard somebody say one time
You can make it, if you try
And some of us, we tried so hard, we tried so hard
I want you to know that I don't speak for myself
But I speak for y'all too right now
Ya see, if you have white-like brown skin and a high yeller
You're still black
So we all got to stick together right now
This I wanna say to you my sisters and my brothers
Right on sister
Right on brother

Dig this:
And we keep on pushing down
We've got to make it a little bit further
We've got to make it a little further
All we got to do is try, try, try
And some of us, we've tried so hard
We've tried so hard, we've tried so hard
We've tried so hard, so hard to be somebody
We've tried so hard, although, they're holding us back
And it stairs the reason, that they're doing us like that
You know what? It is
I believe, it is because we are black
But hey, we can't stop now, we can't stop now
We've got to keep on, keep on, keep on, keeping on
We've got to keep on keeping on
I know and I know and I know that you know that I know it ain't right
Oh, it ain't right, it ain't right, it ain't right
That they hold us, hold us, hold us back
They're holding us back, they're holding us back
I wonder, sometimes I sit down, sit down and I wonder",Syl Johnson,1969,"[79, 94, 94]",3

90,A World Without Music,"[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]
If you were the first one to hear a record crackle when the tape hits
Tell me the things that you would do to relay this
It feels like the revelation of a lifetime
A new way to build bonds with like-minds
Conversely imagine the world with no music
You heard the last note, you heard the last quote
You heard the last record crackle when the tape hits
What would you do to either change or escape this?
Even nature felt the haul, consider the soul
It dries rivers as we wither from withdrawal
The nighttime suffered the most and conquered the sun
The moon feared to even appear to anyone
Refusing to speak is mystique, it leave us asleep
With dreams that's less vivid you go to speak
But creams of thoughts vanish, we lost a whole language
You can't see him drop to his knees, so you could manage

[Verse 2: Mr. Lif]
If you decide to speak art to bleed hearts
And repaint the faint of colorful thoughts
The residue manifest has a view
Of the world you once knew with the (check - one, two)
Rivers replenish to the point they seem endless
The summer's independent, no dilemma for the heavens
A pleasant twist as the mist started to lift
The granted wish if you had a man to bliss
If music returns I heard the man who puts planets in urns
Felt this planet been foiled and thus he granted the soil
From that root of new boom bap to slap you
Maybe you'll cherish life's beauty in act two",L’Orange & Mr. Lif,1969,[92],1

Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above, velvet hands in the upper glove—touch
Like bad double dutch, and two Amsterdam's ain't enough—D.R.U.G.S. 
""Don't ruin us,"" God said—DROGAS—too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer, like soca, not a chain, but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures, pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder, eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades, bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak, park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening, or two feet on a Riesling (Yeah!) slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind, decorate me with shine till I go blind

To only find truth in the fountain, drownin' in power, surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder—cut—that's a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect, names don't last like Mr. X, unless you Galilee
Droppin' bowling balls on the discotheque, with a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance—it's a new year, every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal, yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy, tsunami you up off your surfboard

Medusa turned coke into stone with a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said—

"".. Rakim, the microphone soloist""

[Verse 1]
Follow procedures, the crowd couldn't wait to see this
Nobody been this long awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this—I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding
Rock, I keep it hot and blow the spot without warning
The Emperor, well known for, inventing a sentence
Full of adventure, turning up the temperature
Rush with adrenaline, how long has it been again
To be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?

[Hook: Samples]
""It's been a long time..""
"".. Rakim, the microphone soloist""

[Verse 2]
When I'm out propping—either hanging or shopping—
People see me, stop, and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in formation like a soldier
Like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Muammar Gaddafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital, taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Ayo, technical difficulties is through

""It's been a long time..""
"".. Rakim, the microphone soloist""

[Verse 3]
When I flow tonight, I show them new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like 3D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""
My notebook's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So, yo, I'm online; it's been a long time",Rakim,1969,"[96, 96]",2

Can I ask you a favor, please?
Let her in my door and don't look back here no more
I know you can do it with ease

Although we're on our way from the show
And you don't like to get off the track
Please, Mr. Chauffeur, let's talk things over
'Cause she says she loves me and that's a fact

Can you hear what I'm sayin'? It's not like I'm prayin'
You know because you've done it before
So, why make me wait, please don't hesitate
Just get back here and let her in my door

Hey, Mr. Limousine Driver
I know you know where it's at
Too late will be later, you just read your evening paper
And don't worry 'bout what's goin' on in back

97,Guess Who,"[Verse 1: Wax]
All the fellas go ape shit, when I spit the boiling heat
Plus I put it down for the ladies like a toilet seat
I destroy the beat, the one that E created
Then we do a high five and get inebriated

[Dumbfoundead]
Big Wax and DFD, that's my name abbreviated
These are rated R bars, all of y'alls are PG rated
Elevated high like someone sprinkled us with pixie dust
Catch us at a college town, sipping on a dixie cup

[Wax]
Sick as fuck and unpredictable is how my vocal flow is
Inspired by crazy trains of thought, I got locomotives
I know you noticed that I flow the coldest
When me and DFD team we easily steamroll opponents

[Dumbfoundead]
The soul of Otis and the heart of John Lennon
Just a couple playboys with a flock of blonde women
The South Korean James Dean, the Cuban Dean Martin
Any human being starting shit is soon to be a target

This ain't Batman and Robin
It ain't Dolce and Gabanna
This ain't Biden and Obama
You should go and ask your momma for a clue
Guess who?
This ain't Sherlock and Watson
OJ and Johnnie Cochran
Malone and John Stockton
Holla if you got a problem with it two
Guess who

[Verse 2: Wax]
My verses all start proper
Turn the hipster rapper to a Wal-Mart shopper
You ain't fresh, you're from concentrate
And the thought of quitting rapping is one that you need to contemplate

[Dumbfoundead]
We rock the place and leave the ceiling collapsing
Any party that we throw you know it's finna be cracking
All you rappers biting styles and identity jacking
There's like ten of mes and ten of these Waxes

[Wax]
I leave enemies mentally trapped in states of fear and self-loathing
Feeling so small they could probably fit in elf clothing
As for me, I'm a gigantic man
That'll rock it til the death like the Titanic band

[Dumbfoundead]
Wearing bright hammer pants you couldn't touch this kind of ruckus
We're the type of mother fuckers throwing punches at your function
Chewing up these rappers like some double mint gum
Spending hundreds at a strip club using government funds

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wax]
With whack mother fuckers I just don't associate
I ain't mad at 'em I just hope they don't procreate
They gets no love, only hate
Then like a kobe steak, they get slowly ate

[Dumbfoundead]
Check the trophy case, you can tell we never lose
Our videos get box office numbers, you get several views
Ebenezer Scrooge money, racking up the revenue
All we got is headbangers, like them heavy metal dudes

[Wax]
You need to tell whoever's revving you up they need to pump the brakes
You couldn't spit my ad libs in five hundred takes
Don't beat yourself up, we all make dumb mistakes
You just make more than anybody else fucking makes

[Dumbfoundead]
The guys that you love to hate, puffing dank, purple drink
Type to party hard the night before another working day
The dynamic duo, better act like you know
Two mother fuckers ranked numero uno

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I mean you get ya check, I can't knock that
But it's a culture, you can't forget about that

Too many vultures in it (too many)
I think Nas said Hip Hop Is Dead cause he couldn't see the culture in it
Too many funny clothes (too much), too many Auto-Tunes (haha)
Too many gangsters, when they made the Auto Goon (when they made those)
Listen boy you should play your role
Like rap don't need a brand new De La Soul
Pay homage to any MC who paved our road
Or the big Mercedes Benz boy won't get drove
I say that cause, I be where the monsters at
I'm like God damn, they even screwed up conscious rap (God dammit)
I think rap need a new P.E. to +Fight The Power+ and be free (Fight The Power)
And try to bring the light like GE (GE)
I think we deaf, dumb and we blind and for the ten hundredth time
Who give a damn about our swag and our grind? (who give a damn?)
Why don't you rhyme about a thought that you had on your mind
You an MC, let me see, how you really design, ya know?

It's been long gone

At once, I'm positive and negative
I'm hyper and I'm calm as a sedative (ah)
The artist, the executive
At once, the son and the father, the comedy and the drama
The fun and the karma, the shame and the honor
The skin under the armor, the bullet that pierce the flesh
The love of life, the fear of death
How it flash before your eyes, when a knife is near your chest
We the best, we the worst, the club or the church
The soap or the dirt, the murder, the birth
At once (yeah), the idol worship sittin in the seaport (uh)
Waitin for a war that ain't ever gon' be fought (no)
The correspondents coverin' this attack on free thought (oh)
Kwe and Styles P we got it covered like three fourths
Time to wake up, Teddy P. said it best when he was in the Blue Notes

Hip-hop is in my heart, I keep it closer than my enemies
I bet you they remember me, word

[Verse 3: Styles P]
I think all you need's a beat and a hook (that all)
I need entertainment now, light a blunt and go and read me a book
Why don't you make a dance song? That'll get you a look
BET, MTV, that'll get ya some push
Give it a month or two homie, you'll be hittin the roof
The hip hop heads mad but I'm spittin the truth (it's the truth)
It's the computer age now, better get with the youth (gotta get with 'em)
Don't nobody give a damn of what you spit in the booth
Better make your ringtone, keep your bling on
Sing anything and try to get your sing on
Me I'm just laughin, rollin, rollin
While I'm rollin in a Caddy that's golden
No I ain't a pimp or guerrilla pimp (uh uh)
I'm just a poet that all the killers with

It's getting to the point where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly, I must cry out loud
""I am lonely""

I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are

Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock and laughter the key to your heart

Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone, I'm tired of you
What have you got to lose?

Can I tell it like it is? (help me, I'm suffering)
Listen to me, baby
It's my heart that's suffering, it's a-dying (help me, I'm suffering)
And that's what I have to lose

I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?

And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed

They don’t hear the sirens over their words

Throwing opinions, instead of asking for help
But there is no good in shouting when you want to be heard

Empathy
When you feel afraid
And don’t know what to say
Just try a little kindness
And we’ll be saved

Try a little kindness

Hey ya hey ya
Hey ya hey ya

The way that we’re talking, with anger and blame
It don’t make peace the object, it only divides

Keep trying to win, like conversation’s a game
But there is no need to fight, we’re all on the same side

You gotta try a little kindness

Treat the world around you with
Empathy
When you feel afraid
And don’t know what to say
Just try a little kindness

Hey ya hey ya (try a little kindness )

Running in the rain sometimes
It’d be a shame
If we wasted our days, not being kind

Call up a friend

And I hope that my life will be a light, shining bright for those who are lost in the dark

Wanna feel the animal within, be wild like the wind, but gracious
I'm gonna plant my seeds
I'm gonna watch them grow
And I hope that my forest will restore in us a chorus that was lost long ago

In the distance I can see blue, the sun has got to break through someday

Wanna hear my people singing, singing songs of redemption
Singing songs of the truth, singing songs of the peaceful warrior nation
Singing songs to the Gods, of Love and thankfulness
'Cause we are alive and we're striving to thrive and we know that we're blessed

[Mike Love & Nahko Bear]
'Cause we are the ones who come to wipe away the poison that's been seeping into the heart, that's keeping us apart

How we gonna get anywhere, when everybody's running in place
Are we blind or are we just scared, scared we're gonna come face to face
And have to face the things that we've done, come to terms with what we've become
Come around and fix our mistakes, only Love can find a way

When the walls are crumbling and that deadlines creeping up
When that debt comes calling, and the sky's falling from above
You can always count on Love

I wanna swim seas, I wanna climb mountains
Wanna make angels in the snow, dip my toes in the eternal fountain
Gonna speak the truth, and though I've told some lies
I'm gonna wear my heart out on my sleeve for you to believe the honesty in my eyes

Like a songwriter finding meaning in a rhyme
Like a poet who uses words as weapons and lives to fight another day

Like a place where race, religion, sex or creed or class don't have a name

They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You won’t carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
I’m on fire and I’m going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go

[Chorus: Mariah]
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Path that I chose flashing camera’s as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it’s hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper

Can’t fall down stay triumphant, keep on living

107,Get Rhythm,"[Chorus]
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

[Verse 1]
A Little shoeshine boy he never gets low down
But he's got the dirtiest job in town
Bending low at the peoples feet
On the windy corner of the dirty street
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes
How'd he keep from getting the blues
He grinned as he raised his little head
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said

[Chorus]
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine
It'll shake all your trouble from your worried mind
Get rhythm when you get the blues

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
Get a rock and' roll feeling in your bones
Put taps on your toes and get gone
Get rhythm when you get the blues

[Verse 2]
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was going to jump for joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a working that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a popping and he said again

[Chorus]
Get rhythm when you get the blues
Come on, get rhythm when you get the blues
It only costs a dime, just a nickel a shoe
But does a million dollars worth of good for you
Get rhythm when you get the blues",Johnny Cash,1969,"[70, 68, 60, 71, 79, 94]",6

[Verse One] [Deacon the Villain]
Shorty
She do the damn thing
Fine as champagne
Hot, and the way that she trot
She only fan flames
A Super Freak, but please don't call this man James
If she put it on me, bet a nigga pull a hamstring
The type of strange that makes you forget your name
Amnesia to a player, she makes you forget your game
Coach
She got me caught up, like an alley oop
I can ride at Sally's like a jockey but she got me spooked
I'm feeling like a youth but
To tell you the truth though
I do wanna crush
It's
A little more than lust
Trust
I'm no Goodyear gimp
But she got me stumped
Lookin' Bubba Gump tryna Shrimp
I was a pimp bitch
Mixed with modern day Romeo
But today my pimp look more like Polio
Overdosed off of beauty got me comatose
Shorty so blessed makes the Reverend catch a holy ghost

They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized..

[Verse Two] [Natti]
The way her booty sway got me caught up in a daze
Wish it was maze, I'd get lost in it for days
Cause I be so amazed when it's jiggling in waves
Her body so sweet, I bet she sweat glaze
I'm long as three shoes while I'm staring at her boobs
But I be swimming in a gaze and made my inner tubes
They keep me so amused
Like two new Rubik's Cubes
Twins so perfect, so easy to confuse
Her stare is therapy for me forgetting all my problems
I'm victim to a vixen when swishin' in apple bottoms
Switching my position, trying to sit where I can spot em
Got em
Right there in my line of view
And then she caught me, but she smiled like she was so amused
Then she spoke, ""your girl is right behind you, fool""
Snapped me out of it
Kinda slapped me out of it
Hypnotism is my prison, someone get me out of it

[Hook]
They just sparkle and they twinkle, and I’m hypnotized
Her stare cut through, and I’m hypnotized

[Verse Three] [PackFM]
She said he name was Gwendolyn
The only reason I remember it is cause it rhymes with pendulum
And that's the way her hips were swayin'
Otherwise, I can't recall a word her lips were sayin'
Damn it y'all I'm mesmerize
Her eyes they got me hypnotized
She got me shaking my head
But I ain't saying no
Lookin' her up and down, but I ain't nodding yes, I'm saying, ""Woah""
I see her mouth movin'
I think my mouths open
Hope I don't start droolin'
Shit is in slow motion
I gotta say somethin'
""Uuhhh""
Nice goin'
Snap out of it player okay
Time to focus
""Did you just pinch yourself?""
""Cause you'se a dream come true""
I grew an inch myself comin' up with things to do
Oh shit she didn't slap me
Imagine that
Fuck it didn't happen
I just imagined that
Shit I blew it y'all
Where'd she go? I can't believe it
I hate to see her go
But love to watch her leavin'

But an unhappy home

I wanna say sorry
Oh, but it ain't a strong enough word
For once in my life I'm so sincere
And I mean every word

I listen to what my friends had to say
But ooh, they messed me up again

Run by hard fighting men both of honor and of fame
She flew the stars and stripes of the land of the free

Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
Oh, tell me, what were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

One hundred men went down to their dark and watery graves
When that good ship went down, only forty-four were saved
'Twas the last day of October, they saved forty-four
From the dark icy water of that cold Iceland shore

Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
Oh, tell me, what were their names?

Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

It was there in the dark of that cold and watery night
They watched for the U-boats and they waited for a fight
Then a whine and a rock and a great explosion's roar
They lay the Reuben James on that cold ocean floor

Oh, tell me, what were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?
Oh, tell me, what were their names?
Tell me, what were their names?
Did you have a friend on the good Reuben James?

Those cold, icy waters, they're still and they're calm
Many years have passed and still I wonder why

That wakes me up and tells me I can't win
I'd love to wake up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again

If heaven were to hear my heart's confession
Wanting you would be my greatest sin
But I'm glad that you're no longer my possession
Cause I'm so afraid of losing you again

Being close to you revives the sorrow
That wakes me up and tells me I can't win

And smokey bar in Vegas
And I guess that I don't have
What it takes for Las Vegas
But my dreams still linger on
Though my faith is almost gone
But my will is strong and
I've gotta make it big in Vegas

Also a French kiss and a Greek dance
A Swedish wrench and Scottish whiskey a Spanish burger
And Nachman Meuman is the most Israeli - collect call!

And walked down to the water's edge

That the night would be a bummer

Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, no
Yes, sir
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, no

Boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
That when I think of you
I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time
I must get down
Got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die, hey

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, yeah
Oh no
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good, little girl
Mmhmm

Don't you get too lost in all I say
Yeah, but at the time you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get safe so I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and a different face

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, yeah
Feeling alright
Hey, I'm not feeling that good myself

Oh, you feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself

Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself

I'm not feeling that good myself",Joe Cocker,1969,"[96, 97, 69, 69, 70, 79, 79, 100]",8

I gotta hurry up my phone finna die

That's like me checking my call log, and the most dodged one
And hear out everything I know, i'm tryna solve em
Shorty be at me on the web, I won't get caught up
Just made a vine and been smoking, got this bitch caught up
Bitch i'm in Miami, it feel like i'm back home, aye

Got my whole center united, can't go back home, aye

Told her all my business, she know i'm my father to the bone
Rolling off a hitta, I ate Xan, it made last summer cold
Forgot what made me me, forgot my month, my whole summer gone
Back to school she ready get from far from me as possible
Bitch I go to tour, i'm in your city, that's impossible
Masked up, black thoughts and feelings mental robbers who
Been through this like five times, I still don't know what i'ma do
And i'm still stuck on my last high
Don't think I have the courage to do that again
Fuck the rules, look who raised me, I know how this end
Fuck the rules, look who raised me, I know how this end

139,Is That All There Is,"I remember when I was a very little girl
Our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face
As he gathered me up in his arms
And raced through the burning building onto the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to a fire?""

[Chorus]
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And when I was 12 years old
My daddy took me to the circus,
The greatest show on earth
There were clowns and elephants, dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
As I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what
When it was all over I said to myself
""Is that all there is to the circus?""

[Chorus]
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is

And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks down by the river
Or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
Then one day he went away
And I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't, I said to myself
""Is that all there is to love?""

Is that all there is? is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep...

I know what you must be saying to yourselves
""If that's the way she feels about it, why doesn't she just end it all?""
Oh, no. Not me
I'm not ready for that final disappointment
Cause I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
And when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath,
I'll be saying to myself

[Chorus]
Is that all there is?
Is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is",Peggy Lee,1969,"[28, 23, 14, 11, 13, 14, 17, 33, 50, 76]",10

Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all, you don't stop
You won't stop, stop that body rock
And I can rock you here, and then rock the house
I can rock to the beat, you can't can't stop
I say the beat goes on, I pop popcorn
It's one MC until the break-a-dawn
Well I'm the K-A-Y, the G double E

Well I'm the K-A-Y, the G double E
The letters of my name, it can rock the beat
Well I'm a, Clark Kent, as I'm shootin' the gif

As I kick it to the ceil-ah, burstin' out
You don't stop, you won't stop that body rock
AJ, all the way, my man, AJ, is all the way
Check it out, I was walkin' down the street
Just a-hummin' to the beat, and everybody else
Was just doin' the freak, then they ask me
About another MC, I said a ""when"" and a ""where""
And I don't give a damn
They look like a dilly, but they're doin' a jam
I was walkin' down the street, without a doubt
And then I saw this girl, feelin' out
Then I told the girl, what it's gonna be
Let's go for a ride in community
With the rhythm of the rap, it went so fast
I kissed the girl, as we walk past
We got home, she started workin' with me
I said to myself, ""I know this can't be""
The girl turned around, and then she broke down
And I just laughed, and just bugged out, a smoker
I said ""baby be calm, baby be cool""
Let me be, use the golden rule
And yes my mellow, you know what I said
I told the girl ""jump in the bed""
Jumped in the bed, we're having fun
She said ""KG, you're number one""
You don't stop, that body rock
Rap be be, rap be be
Ay baby, come and get up out your seat
Now throw your arms in the air
And wave 'em in the air like you just don't care
Just throw your arms in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you're ready to rock, rock, turn the mother out
Somebody say, ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!)
Ho ho! (Ho ho!)
Ho ho! (Ho ho!)
You don't stop, fly girls, fly girls just to rock
You fly girls, check it out
If you're fly as a dreadlock, check it out
You don't stop, that body rock
Fly girls so you, fly girls so on
And then you rock to the beat until the break-a-dawn
Fly girls, you really think you're fly
You only dance with the niggas that get you high
Well let me tell you somethin', you ain't so cute
And just because you're dressed in a brand new suit
You girls never seperate from the rest
But the person I like seein' is what you don't posses
Comin' in the room, who do you think you are
You better find out who you are before you ever try out
To be a super star, you don't stop
You won't stop that body rock
You don't quit, you don't quit
Because the rhythm of the beat is just so sweet
And I'm a, KG, and I'm rockin' your knees
You don't stop, you won't stop
You can't stop, that body rock
And all the fellas, and all the fellas
And all the fellas in the house say Ho! (Ho!)
Ho! (Ho!), you don't stop
All the ladies in the house say ow! (Ow!)
Ow! (Ow!), you don't stop

Michael: What?
Toby: Just to refresh you... .
Michael: NO!
Toby: on our policy.
Michael: What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
Toby: Maybe not some of them. Maybe not inappropriate ones.
Michael: There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.

Michael: Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.
Toby: Yeah, okay. Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the Company Sexual Harassment policy so I'll go over that later.
Michael: I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.

Michael: A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says ""Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?"" This is what's at stake.

Michael: Time to bring out the big guns. I'm heading down to the warehouse where jokes are born. Find a killer joke that'll just blow everybody away at the seminar later. And remind them what is great about this place. So... ah! Here they are. [to Warehouse guys] Guys! Wondering if I could, uh, get your help for something. I'm looking for a new joke to tell and it needs to be just killer. And it does not need to be clean. So whatcha got?
Darryl: Like a joke? A knock-knock joke?
Michael: Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
Darryl: Well, [points at Michael] those are some awful tight pants you have on. Where'd you get em? Like Queers R Us?
Roy: Boys R Us!
Warehouse Guy: Oh!
Michael: Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Darryl: Man, we can see all your business coming around the corner, okay? You need to, you know, hide the... good thing you don't have a lot of business to start with.
Michael: Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Roy: Hey, hey, hey.
Michael: What?
Roy: So you don't have the biggest package. Don't feel bad.
Michael: I don't feel bad.
Darryl: [fake whispers to Roy] I think he feels bad.
Michael: No, I don't.
Roy: You look like you feel bad.
Michael: Okay.
Roy: Little package!
Michael: Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
Warehouse guy: Little package! Little package!
Michael: Thank you.
Roy: You look good.
Darryl: Hiding from his momma.
Warehouse guys: [kissing noises, sheep baaing sounds]

Toby: So remember, intent is irrelevant. And that's it. Pam?
Pam: Um... I just wanted to say that... Just, my Mom's coming in today.
Kevin: MILF!
Pam: Thanks, Kevin.

Pam: Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.

Pam: She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.
Toby: Great point.
Pam: Thank you.
Toby: Um... in fact, basic rule of thumb, let's just act everyday like Pam's Mom's coming in. All right. That's it. Um... if anybody has any questions about anything, you know where I sit in the back.
Michael: Hi, is it over?
Toby: Uh, yes!
Michael: No.
Toby: I can go over it with you.
Michael: I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Toby: It's over.
Michael: Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
Angela: Email forwards.
Michael: Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Angela: I hate them. You send me these filthy emails and you say forward them to ten people or you'll have bad luck.
Michael: Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Stanley: That is my daughter. She goes to Catholic girls' school. I am taking it down right now.
Meredith: Um... what about office romance?
Toby: Office relationships are never a good idea. Yeah. So let's just try to avoid them. But, um, if you already have one, you should disclose it to HR.
Phyllis: All relationships? Eh, even a one-night stand?
Michael: I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Dwight: Yeah, Meredith.
Michael: No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
Dwight: Yes.
Michael: She would have definitely slept with me.
Kevin: She wasn't that hot.
Michael: Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
Toby: Ok, you know, Michael...

Jim: I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.

Michael: What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her ""partner"" in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?
Toby: No.
Michael: What if they made out? In front of everybody?
Toby: Well, that would be...
Michael: At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
Toby: Okay, I'm lost.
Michael: Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?

Video: [Crossing the Line: Rules for the Modern Workplace]
Michael: I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Jim: No, thanks. I'm good.
Michael: That's what she said. Pam?
Pam: Uh... my mother's coming.
Michael: That's what she sai [clears throat] Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.

Dwight: Hey, Toby.
Toby: Hey Dwight.
Dwight: You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Toby: Sure.
Dwight: Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?

Toby: Technically, I am in Human Resources. And Dwight was asking about human anatomy. Um... I'm just sad the public school system failed him so badly.

Toby: Yeah, maybe when you get really comfortable with each other, you can ask for that.
Dwight: Good. Good. And...
Toby: I should get back to work.
Dwight: Okay.

Man in Video: In today's fast-paced business climate, it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line. Let's take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves 'where is the line?'
Video: [Scenario 1: The Natural Redhead]
Roy: Natural redhead.
Actor: Hey, Rach.
Redheaded Actress: Hey, Joe. Mike.
Actor: Hey, settle a bet. Are you a natural redhead?
Darryl: Oh, Mi... ! Hey, stop the video! Michael, stop it right there! Stop it right there! That's that girl from that thing. [pointing at Redheaded Actress] I banged this girl right here. This is...
Roy: That's her?
Darryl: Yes, this is the one.
Roy: No!
Darryl: You remember? Yes!
Roy: At the party?
Warehouse guy: You banged her?
Darryl: Yes! [to video screen] Right here. You are a naughty girl!
Michael: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.

Jan: [to cell phone] Yes. Yes, I did. Okay. Well, we can talk about that later then. [to Pam] Hi.
Michael: Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.

Todd Packer: Don't ever let this little bitch drive you around town. We got, uh, lost for half an hour.
Pam: I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.
Todd Packer: Where is Michael Snot? Sniffing some dude's thong? Probably.

Michael: So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.
Mr. O'Malley: I love lawyer jokes.
Michael: Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.

Michael: When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.

Jan: You seem a little bit agitated, Michael. What's the problem?
Michael: The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
Jan: Well, that... that's true in a way. You can't say anything.
Michael: Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
Jan: Do you need to see the video again, Michael?
Michael: No, I've seen the video.
Toby: [to Jan] He talked the whole time.
Michael: No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]

Michael: Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things. And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.
Jim: Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Michael: Mmmhmm. Yes.
Jim: Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...
Michael: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
Jan: Michael. MICHAEL!
Michael: [laughing] Come on.
Jan: Michael, please.
Todd Packer: There he is.
Michael: Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office]
Todd Packer: There he is. Good one.

Michael: You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.
Jan: Mike... Michael. Please. I... I... really.
Michael: It's... That's...
Jan: That's not my sense of humor.
Michael: Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
Jan: Wha...
Michael: I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
Albiny: [to camera] And motorcycle head injuries, worker's comp, and diet pill lawsuits.
Michael: This guy does it all.
Jan: [to Albiny] 'Scuse me, I'm sorry. [to Michael] Michael. Mr. O'Malley is your lawyer.
Michael: What?
Jan: Mr. O'Malley is our Corporate lawyer. We have him on retainer. To protect the company as well as upper level management, such as yourself.
Michael: So I'm not in trouble?

Michael: I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.

Michael: Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...
Albiny: Yeah, but I did a lot of paperwork at home before I got here.
Michael: I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.

Pam's Mom: Um... hello.
Pam: [ecstatic] Oh my god!
Pam's Mom: Finally made it!
Pam: Hello!

Pam: I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.

Pam's Mom: This is all yours?
Pam: Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.
Pam's Mom: Oh, my goodness. That's great.

Todd Packer: So a guy goes home, tells his wife, ""Honey. Pack your bags. I just won the lottery."" She goes, ""Oh my god! That's incredible! Where are we going?"" He goes, ""I don't know where you're going, just be out of here by five!"" [men laugh] Boom!

Pam: This is where I used to keep my computer.
Pam's Mom: Oh, right! I remember...
Pam: But then I moved it.
Pam's Mom: with the picture.
Pam: Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...
Pam's Mom: Sure.
Pam: So this is like, um, an organization station...
Pam's Mom: [to Roy] Oooooh!
Pam: Hey!
Pam's Mom: Well, there he is!
Roy: How are ya?
Pam's Mom: Hi, handsome!
Roy: You look great!
Pam's Mom: Oh, thank you! So! We ready for dinner?
Pam: Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.
Pam's Mom: Oh, I don't believe that.
Roy: Okay, I'm going to go wait in the parking lot. And what kind of tunes you want for the ride? Little, uh, classical? Or oldies?
Pam's Mom: Oh, anything is fine.
Roy: All right, I'll see ya.
Pam's Mom: So which one is Jim?
Pam: Mom!
Pam's Mom: I just wanted to know.
Pam: No.
Pam's Mom: All right. Okay.
Pam: Ten minutes.
Pam's Mom: Okay.
Pam: Then we can go to dinner.
Pam's Mom: I'll make myself busy.

Todd Packer: There's this guy. He's at a Nymphomaniac Convention. And he is psyched 'cause all these women are smokin' hot perfect 10's, except for this one chick who looks a lot like, uh... [points at Phyllis]
Kevin: Phyllis?
Michael: No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
Todd Packer: Ex-squeeze me?
Michael: Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
Kevin: Packer said it.
Michael: No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Phyllis: I'm the same age as you, Michael.
Michael: I don't know about that.
Phyllis: We're in the same High School class.
Michael: Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
Kevin: You mean where my desk is?
Michael: Yes, your corner. Go.
Kevin: Okay. I have a lot of work to do anyway.
Michael: Mmmhmmm.
Todd Packer: Oh my. They really got to you, didn't they?
Michael: They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
Phyllis: Michael! Come on!
Michael: Oooh!
Phyllis: You don't have to worry. I'm not going to...
Michael: I'm not worried.
Phyllis: ...report you to HR.
Michael: You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.

Michael: Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.

147,Curly,"[Verse 1: Rob Curly]
She don't know why that she love me, she say she attached
Hanging right up in my face and calling me back when I don't call her back
Asking me questions like I'm gonna crack
Passive aggressive whenever we chat
I got the message that she was a blessing the second she said that she not coming back
Memories flash, sharing a blunt and a bath, listen and loving her laugh
She say ""I hate you"" and I get offended, but I always wondered if she ever meant it
I wanna tell her that I could be different but then Ima wonder if I even meant it
Maybe I'll mention that I'll do the dishes and maybe she'll mention that she miss me too
I got the green but they comes with the blues
Smoking the green to get rid of the blues
Making me choose, lately you making me choose between music and being with you
I got the anger and I got the yelling and I got the stories from being with you, true
I think I made a mistake
I think we actually would have been great
We probably never would ever have parted
I think I'm probably fucking with fate
Give me a break
I did the best that I could with the hardest decision to make
I could be faithful and give up my vision or I could be single and I could be great, great, great

Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright

[Verse 2: Rob Curly]
Pussy is pussy my nigga, it comes and it goes
So focus on getting some money and stop being thirsty and chasing the hoes
She on the pole but she don't even vote
Damn it I'm good like I'm really the pope
Give me the dope like I asked you to roll and you hand me myself
Man I know how it goes
Stereotypical women are difficult
Throwing subliminals at every interval
Making demands that are hardly amenable
That's what you deal with when she is a centerfold
I got the mixer and I got the chemicals
Tryna make chemistry using my syllables
I'm unavailable, heart unavailable
Maybe I'm single and maybe I'm hatable
She say she hate me but love when I rhyme
Ask me to stay but I don't got the time
She was devine, shorty was outta her mind
Calling and texing my line

That I'm in love with you

And, I'm just lovin' your fragrance

And I always open doors
I always have the answers to the questions you're unsure of
Never felt this shit, but I do anything for love
Said, never had it
I do anything for love
And we can do all of these kisses and hugs
Or we can do it even looser and disregard with a shrug
If you doin' something that I really don't approve of
I'll be gettin' kinda jealous and I know you've heard enough
Heaven's gon' be better than this life I'm livin'

You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, uh (one woman)

[Bridge]
I could never say I loved you
I kept up my guard
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise to be

Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

[Verse 2]
I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And Lord, it took me back to something that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way

[Chorus]
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk
And Sunday morning coming down

[Verse 3]
In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

[Chorus]
On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short a' dying

188,This Girl Is A Woman Now,"This girl walked in dreams
Playing in a world of her own
This girl was a child
Existing in a playground of stone
Then one night her world was changed
Her life and dreams were rearanged
And she would never be the same again
This girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live
This girl tasted love, as tender as the gentle dawn
She cried a single tear, A teardrop that was sweet and warm
Our hearts told us we were right
And on that sweet and velvet night
A child had died, a woman had been born
This girl is a woman now, and she's learning how to give
This girl is a woman now, she's found out what it's all about
And she's learning, learning to live

190,What's The Use Of Breaking Up,"What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

Oh you say you're tired and you're uninspired
And you wanna leave me, oh baby
The last time you felt that way
Girl, you left me for a whole day
Then you called me on the telephone (hey baby)
In your sweet and your softest tone (hey baby)
Askin' me ""What should we do?""
When you know all the time that I'm crazy about you

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

We had the same conversation
Well it couldn't have been more than a week ago
I said ""Darlin', you're breakin' my heart
And I don't see how I can take much more""
I got up and walked out of the door (hey baby)
Walked on down to the corner store (hey baby)
And by the time what I said took in
I turned right around and came back again

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

Girl, I guess we do it 'cause it's such a groove (hey baby)
To find somethin' that you need to use (hey baby)
Oh baby, I love you, I swear
And ain't neither one of us goin' nowhere

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

What's the use in breakin' up
When you just turn around and make up?

You know that you and I both started
And if we break up we will be broken hearted

191,When I Die,"[Bob Marley-Interview]

[Verse 1]
I left you outside the gates of heaven
They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my daughter after you
So when she smiles it's sorta like you're still here
It's kinda crazy how time flies
Twenty-five years since my grandmoms died
But it feels like just yesterday when we was all laughing together
Those happy memories are so vivid, they'll last me forever
And yet you're still here somehow, I still feel your presence
I credit you for my inner strength, I feel it in my essence
In my soul, in my inner being, in my genetics
I wouldn't exist if you hadn't persisted through the trenches
I wouldn't have been a lyricist, I owe you every sentence
Every verse I've ever written, your energy is kinetic
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die

[Verse 2]
I left you outside the gates of heaven
They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my label after you
So when I rhyme it's sorta like you're still here
It's been a year, still in shock about exactly what happened to you
Made a song for you called ""My Uncle""
I was just rapping to you
Just talking to you
I just saw you at my mother's house
I can't believe I just bought a coffin for you
We always feared that you would die from an overdose
God knows you loved to do drugs, it swallowed you whole
But in the end, drugs didn't kill you, cancer did
Why do good people die young?
I don't know what the answer is
All I know is I worshipped you as a scrappy kid
Being around you made me feel cooler than rapping did
And that's pretty fucking cool, trust me
I was embarrassed when you started smoking crack
Honestly, it crushed me - Swept it under the rug
Started smoking weed and popping acid
But managed to not do the uglier drugs
We grew apart after my grandmother died
Homeless, in and outta jail, we stopped relating to each other's lives
But years later, we connected once again
Not just as nephew and uncle, but as homies, we were friends
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die",ILL BILL,1969,"[43, 32, 26, 18, 19, 21, 24, 32, 42, 47, 55, 64, 80]",13
192,Make Believe,"[Intro]

She was gonna break my heart regardless
So I took her out and dumped her in the garbage
Stupid bitch done turned herself into a target (Yeah)
Just for talkin' nonsense, claiming she was leavin'

[Verse 2]
Hate it when you tease
Where you think you're goin'? When you comin' back from me?
You walked in, I'm listening to ""Stan"" on E, yeah, ecstasy
Matter of fact there's a bridge that my car wants to meet
Road trip on me, it'll be fun, you'll see
But you don't gotta sit in the trunk, you can sit next to me
Me and Stan, we alike, but he ain't nicer than me
He was drunk drivin', me, I'm just straight Perc-ules

'Cause we hit the bridge, that's just the start

A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company

I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby

You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

[Verse 2]
I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now

You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it

I was unconscious, half-asleep
The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all

You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment

Born on the banks of the Shenandoah
In '61, I went to the war
To win one for Virginia!
Yeah, my brother went first and they called me too
I was green as clover in the morning dew
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune
Carry me back to Virginia!

[Bridge 1]
Fire in the cannon, water in the well
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell
I learned right quick how to march like hell
And affix that bayonet

[Chorus]
Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia

[Verse 2]
With a sword and a saddle
Powder in the gun
We thought for a minute our fight was done
So they lined us up with our medals on
And hammered us into the quicksand
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron
Til the men took cover where the horses piled
Then we shivered in the cold against them

[Bridge 2]
But the war raged on like flames of hell
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell
Dressed in rags and we ate like rats
When they cut off our legs we cried!

And they died in the valley
Died in the swamp
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped
Died in the ditches
Died in the fields
In the belly of a wagon a‘fore our wounds were healed
Died in the war
Starved in the camps
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend
And they buried us all over Dixieland

[Bridge 3]
Down in Alabama
Down in Caroline
Way down in Georgia, on the Tennessee line
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee
Now we want to go home to Virginia
Say we want to go home to Virginia!

Won't ya carry me back?
Won't ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia
Won't ya carry me back?

And I could look the other way but it still won't erase the pain
And I pray that she stay the same, amazing grace
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just another reflection in the window
Watchin' the trees pass by at a tempo
Got a round trip ticket out to limbo
And I'm getting close to my kinfolk
I'm sorry that you didn't get the memo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Water under burned bridges
Always on the road tryna earn a livin'
I remember when I bought my first ticket
I've been going, haven't turned back since then
This return day must be a misprint
Made a wrong turn now I'm long distance
And I miss them

I try to write but every sentence is a run on
I try to text you but I don't get reception in this tunnel
Vision, visit only for a minute
I'm gettin' on track but the wheels still spinnin'
You can see the smoke in the distance, it billows
Roll up my sweatshirt, turn it into a pillow, ay
I got a polaroid camera so I don't forget where I travel
I got a couple rolls of film I'll get developed when I get back to Seattle
I told momma that I'd call her, talked for a couple minutes
But I didn't
I miss my brother, feel disconnected
Wanted to stay, wanted to catch the next one
I wanted to talk, just me and him
Because I had some things I felt I had to tell him
When you're always runnin', tryna make a connection
It's almost impossible to stay connected
When you get on this train after standin' in the rain
You'd be crazy to exit
And give your seat to the next one, nah
I'ma ride this shit 'til the wheels fall off
The conductor screams out, ""All aboard, last call""
The city as you pass on, the city as you pass on

In the spaces and between
Sadness on their faces

I can see the chains of love
The chains
Talking 'bout the chains of love

Storms are brewing in your heart
I don't wanna waste it
Better to have tried it all
Least we got to taste it

Locked up in the chains of love
We change
Caught up in the chains of love
Can't take us away

Clouds moving over the house
I think about those days
Wish I had something to relax my mind
Send me off to heaven
I've got nothing but time

Lightning in the sky above
Blinking, see the traces
Everything you are to me
Is bigger than the spaces

Between us in the chains of love

Locked up in the chains of love

Moma's gonna love her just as much as she can

It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
Then you'd loose it in the snow on the ground
A walkin' to town, to find a job
Tryin' to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe,let the snow
Come through and it chills to the bone
Boy, you better go home,where it's warm
Where you can live in the love of a common people
Be the pride and the heart of a family man

Moma's gonna love you just as much as she can

But he'll just hear that phone keep on ringing
Off the wall, that's all

As if I don't know why your face so blank
Bet a real nigga try to tell you what it is
You was standing screaming, ""No the fuck it ain't""
Why the fuck you can't? Why he never will?
Funny cause those same conversations got a young roadrunner laughin' straight to the bank
And I ain't got beef, 'less its bread on my head don't mistake the situation
Say you got hittas, bout it boys,  real hittas ain't tweeting with location
Put in work, did vacation, pouring out
Liquor for my niggas lord knows that they should've made it
And I don't like niggas screaming ""Live life"" when you living life like a pussy
Green dot goals gettin' sent to my niggas lord pray they keep on pushing
Pray I keep moving, know I keep it thugging
Fuck a hater nigga man I never seen them niggas cause they never seen nothing
Never felt my pocket, same niggas plotting
Same niggas with her now standing at the motherfucking ending like ""We did it!""
But we ain't even made it, I'm just getting fucking faded
Belaire Rose and I'm sipping on this shit like ""Mm this tasty""
Man I swear I can taste it
Looking at this money man, motherfuckers swear I had to chase it

224,A Boy Named Sue,"[Verse 1]
My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 2]
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""

[Verse 3]
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean
My fist got hard and my wits got keen
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name

[Verse 4]
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew
At an old saloon on a street of mud
There at a table, dealing stud
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""

[Verse 5]
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye
He was big and bent and gray and old
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Now you're going to die!!""

[Verse 6]
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer

[Verse 7]
I tell you, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile

[Verse 8]
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong

[Verse 9]
He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do
But ya ought to thank me, before I die
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Because I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue

[Verse 10]
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son
And I came away with a different point of view
And I think about him, now and then
Every time I try and every time I win
And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him

237,Life And Death In G & A,"[Killah Priest]
My daughters are bad; they kill men, record 'em then laugh
I require blood sacrifice, slaughter the calf
One name Ice, the other name Fire
Flames for hair, every pussy cloud desire
I spit 'em out in my image and finish
At the end of their sentence, these women are visions of Virgin
Two-trillion in my mouth, doin' service
Shaped like verses, seductive, darin', destructive
Flarin' over percussions, I spit dark forms of matter
The darkness that draws the atoms
The darkness that bonds the nucleus
That water, alkaline thru platinum
Within the uterus, I spit storms that scatter
Thru out the four corners of the Earth
Drawn from the universe darkness that exists
Before creation, stand before me when I spit
That's how I cremate 'em

(Hook)
My daughters are men, they're lesbian
But they only human when they come thru the pen
I call my verse the Virgin, pray to St. Mary before I begin
Is Priest superstitious or loose wit his vision?

[Killah Priest]
The thought of my daughters is Horus performin
The chorus by August that make the forest hauntin' like stormin'
Around my brain is a black cloud
High temperatures rise from within
Pen snaps now, leaves fall from trees
My brain novas, mind alignin', the rhyme is science
Blind assignments, find excitement
It's like I'm typin' 700 words per second
Too much for this record to wreckage
Perfection, pestilence spreadin'
The usual settin' to a musical dead end
Your funeral, such a beautiful expression
Immovable presence of Priest, like pillars in Greece
No more Killah, just P, no iller emcee

(Hook)

[Killah Priest]
Rebellious stars, fallen angels, hell in Mars
Tallest scales over thin shells of my bars
God and devil, life and death, results from ghetto
Mics and breath, Hip-Hop or techno
Bet those people feel me

Ants pack leaves in the hill B
Haters kick dirt till I'm filthy rich
Best flow, guilty, rap's a silky stitch

Two happy people on a Greyhound bus
We came here looking for a life for us
But the nightlife is her new life and the only thing I've found is
San Francisco is a lonely town

Oh, there were good times for a little while
But now her new friends say I cramp her style
I guess I'm only in the way now and she don't need me hanging round
San Francisco is a lonely town

Now she's out there somewhere across the Bay
And she'll be wondering where I am when she gets in today
She'll find I've left her a oneway ticket home
And while she stands there crying all alone
And while the Greyhound keeps on rolling I'll pray the Lord she's found
San Francisco is a lonely town

And if there ever comes a time you decide to change your mind
I'll need a way to hold you and I can cause I'll know all the ways to love a man
But there's so many ways to lose a man so quickly he can slip through your hands
One little thing goes wrong then all at once he's gone
I'd have no way to hold him like I planned
It takes more than just one way to love a man

242,Soul Deep,"[Intro]
Dear Lord please hear me this prayer ain't for me
This for the ones that struggle everyday with they belief
That ain't accepted you but still they relate to me
So painfully I pray you make them able to receive

[Verse 1: Bizzle]
I try to tell them about Christ and they ain't trying to feel it
When I act Christ like they say that I'm the realest
But if I'm just a duplicate then who it is I'm trying to be
Is really who they digging they just trying to fight the feeling
Racism got them claiming its the white religion
Scarred by slavery and all the whites that did it
But slave owners just manipulated Bible scriptures
They claimed Christian but never obeyed the writings in it
They stumble off the imagery provided by the pictures
Like why when I look at God he looks nothing like this
You right and that description is not provided by the scriptures
And folks will be held accountable when Christ arrives to get us
And for you I'm just trying to help you make the right decision
There's only one God ain't no black or white religion
The devil used slavery to magnify division
Now you trapped inside the prison of a past you not forgiving
Forgive them

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain
So Lord I know you feel us
And we done seen alot of things
So my prayer is that you heal us
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)

[Verse 2: Bizzle]
Some of them know some been listening to liars though
Some of them just don't care some of them trying though
Without faith in you what do they rely upon to keep them righteous on the same street that guys are dying on
Doctrine of the devils survival of the fittest
Cause all I see it meaning is survival of the wicked
It's like you play a game and somebody starts cheating you
You feel the only way to beat them is to become a cheater too
They call it being tough Its really being weak
Switching teams out of fear that you'll see defeat
That's like a Crip in the room wit a hundred bloods
Given the option to either dying or becoming one
Homie I know it cause I did it
I hustled cause I feared my way of living if I didn't
I'm familiar with the prison of the mind
But in Him there is no fear
Lord save those who though have an ear don't hear

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain
So Lord I know you feel us
And we done seen alot of things
So my prayer is that you heal us
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)
These scars they run so deep
So deep (x2)


Verse 3
Some think is a wack religion or its not the black religion
In America slavery is the only past were given
Searching for a history that reaches past the masters whippings
Dissing the Bible not knowing how many blacks was in it
So they revert to Egypt we know that they were black
So Moses had to be to fit in when the brought that baby back
Joseph blended in so well his fam ain't recognize him
So how you think Mary took Jesus up to Eygpt to hide him
And honestly back then there wasn't even such a race as black
It wasn't until way later we started claiming that
I can pick the bible up and show you everything that's black
The problem is you should praise him without me even saying that
Worship the Lord who did what you could not do
Cause you were made in is His image
Not cause he looks like you
I'm saying
I understand why you feel how you feel
But feeling don't always tell you what's real
He is the truth and the way and the Life homie

[Chorus]
Cause we done felt a lot of pain

You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man
You know you want a better man

[Verse 1: Johnny J]
I was just chilling, feeling kind of bored
Went to get some drink so I crept to the store
Sipping, cranked up, leaning in my truck
I saw this young freak, she was fingering for my nuts
She was on head with a doobie baby bootie
She want to cruise the beach, but I rather take her to the movies
Or straight to my house, yeah I like that even better
So kick back, relax and take off the hot sweater
Let a real go getter, like me the one and only
Come into your life and you can be my tenderoni
She said cool but that sounded kind of phony
Cause back in the day she used talk to my homie
But I was on a mission, wasn't nothing, no relationship
I only wanted to dig on the one night stand yo
Smooth undercover and playing my cards right
Telling her that I love her but you know that was all hype
Kind of like dinner and the whole nine yards
Got the socco and gin out the trunk of my car
Pull her a drink, a little strong but smooth
30 minutes later, she was all in the mood
Rubbing on my chest and it was getting kind of sweaty
She started undressing I mean the lesson I was ready
(And nigga all I wanna know is did you knock the boots?)
You know what up G, she was one hundred proof
Wasn't taking no short, so I have to come with it
First, I licked her up and down, putting a tape of slow jam and I hit it
A night she'll never forget, I made it legit
And now she won't switch (Why is that?)
Cause I'm a better man

[Hook: Boe]
I'm a better man, what can a nigga do
To let you know that I just want you to know
Let me come inside and show you how I feel when you love me

[Verse 2: Johnny J]
Check it, roses are red and violets are blue
Me and you we go together, like two and two, me fucking you
I'm the J to the O to the H-N-Y
J-love making love to you, any kind of way
I wanna rock, but I don't want to tie the notch
J is for the way of rock and I don't stop
Till the next day, we can sex play
Telling me you're loving every minute and that you wanna stay
Thinking to yourself (Damn, what should I do?)
About this other busta nigga that's in love with you
But I don't give a fuck, cause J is on the real
I'm bringing off crop, I'm giving her something she can feel
She might stray away but not too far
A nigga like me would give her more than a dick on hard
That's me, the menace to freak
Yo, I be tossing the freak and be up all energy
Radio won't play it, because its X-rated
Title better name, but ya still can't fade it
Fucking is the game and drinking is my favorite sport
So Temp-T get off the freakin passport
Back to the way I like a certain ho
I eat them up like tootsie roll
And fuck them sore till the pussy close
Doing damage to your backbone
All night long like Keet said, your sex got it going on
I know your thinking to yourself, it wasn't part of the plan
But that's how it's done by a better man

Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
""Baby, don't forget""

Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

[Interlude]
Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

[Verse 3]
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
""Hey mama, don't forget

[Chorus 2]
To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me""

[Verse 4]
Tonight I find myself kneeling by the bed to pray
I haven't done this in a while

Hiked a hundred highways
Never found a home
Still in all I'm happy
The reason is, you see
Once in a while along the way
Love's been good to me

[Verse 1]
There was a girl in Denver
Before the summer storm
Oh, her eyes were tender
Oh, her arms were warm
And she could smile away the thunder
Kiss away the rain
Even though she's gone away
You won't hear me complain

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There was a girl in Portland
Before the winter chill
We used to go a-courting
Along October hill
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
Cry away the snow
It seems like only yesterday
As down the road I go

249,Lodi,"[Verse 1]
Just about a year ago
I set out on the road
Seekin´ my fame and fortune
Lookin´ for a pot of gold
Things got bad and things got worse
I guess you know the tune
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

[Verse 2]
Rode in on the Greyhound
I´ll be walkin´ out if I go
I was just passin´ through
Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money
Looks like they took my friend
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

[Verse 3]
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connections
Ran out of songs to play
I came into town a one night stand
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

[Verse 4]
If I only had a dollar
For every song I´ve sung
And every time I had to play
While people sat there drunk
You know, I´d catch the next train
Back to where I live

250,My Balloon's Going Up,"[Intro]
Cause we're going x2

[Verse 1]
Aww, man, these fake niggas stalling
They try to take their best shots and end up air balling
Aww, man, you will never ever get it
I like your new lifestyle, you should name it quit
I'm Mr. Louis V. Newton
I'm feeling good, tell me how you doing?
Cause there's more to being flashy
When you're the modern day Jay Gatsby
There's more to life than shoes and cars
There's more in the universe than shooting stars
You need more than clothes to know you are
If you don't get me let me explain with these bar
I'm, just trying to uplift my people up
The same way that you raising those cups
The same way that I let the liquor pour to the ground
Is the same way I let my soul pour through the sound
Don't let these niggas slow you down
Don't let negativity slow you down
You hear that?
Nothing right
That's how a fucking hater really sounds

[Chorus]
Cause we're going
(Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up)
Never looking back as I rise
There's no way that you're stopping I
In my rear view, all I see is sky
Cause you know I am going
High, High, High
Cause we're going up
To a lever that's never been touch
And you know it's (Up
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up)
To me to get the job done
Won't stop 'til I'm number one

[Verse 2]
Chilling on the dark side of the Moon
I'm going Up, so where is my balloon?
What's up with the hullabaloo?
My bare necessities can turn this into Waterloo
These niggas weak, sorry to report
They talk about change, but three quarters short
From, making any sense out of anything they doing
You never stated facts, so what the fuck you proving?
My progress went from the projects to the penthouse and then out
Into outer space into the ether and then out to the reach of
God's hands
I land in the comfort of my conscious unless
Anybody try to stop my thought process
K(no)w genius sleep never sleeps
So my motto to my foes
""Fuck the rest""
Transform my talents and abilities
Into wealth and tranquility
If I don't get nothing back
I won't get nothing back
In my Sense and Sensibilities
That's why all's ten, perfect in life's scoring system
Only play on those high bars, there's no way you can missing
Even with Jimmy Hoffa vision, a long time I envision
Setting my life with this spitting, if it's mine I know I have to get it
Cause inside I just feel it
Up is where I'm going
No longer down to Earth
Being universal is all I know, man
Cause I'm go go go going",PHZ-Sicks,1969,"[87, 88, 93, 96]",4

And stake out the Navy on every downtown street

Chase nightmares cause the moon got me shunned
Now I don't shine
Offering my lifetime to turn Kryptonite to Bromine

[Verse 1]
Muscling ya'll little acts my soul clean
Plus the bars are lean cause I consume proteins
No beef but more napalm; A-Bombs then the Air Force
Let the air go no reason to hold back if that's what you there for
Therefore let's hope you felt what I dealt
Casting curses hope you felt what I spelled
Like I said, it ain't never hard for me to take a life away
No need to erase with my taste you get it right away
They all say Midas took the touch away
My pen be exhausted it can never find enough to say
Or maybe I just don't say enough
People twist and flip on me now I'm making major cuts
Lofty daddy city will leave bruno on a mali
Grew up watching mami hit papi
New age territorial terrorist
I send MCs to Everest with my cleverness
Max not Cole still could be your therapist
Or local Dade county resident
Avoid the lone wolf big home said if you travel in packs
You get smoked like that
They all say you need a pro to write
You over bite the poltergeist you ain't nun but a prototype
I'm the final version
Talk shit on the net end in yo own webs in person (Yea)
Find yo own way to walk
We from da souf we heavy slang found our own way to talk
Ain't Win in a min of course you got nun to lose
Ain't on the roster switching sides you got nun to do (Yooo)

Rhyme schemes finish your body faster than cancer
Add glitter to the batter watch it flip like antimatter (Hold on)

And I clean his jeans
And I dry his tears
When the breaks don't come, and it ain't no fun
He's my man and he's a real good drummer
It's a bummer when you've got to play
The nickel and the dime
Kind of job that don't pay enough to buy a can of beans
Chicken bone's clean

Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry
Hush, hush, little baby, don't you cry

He's a Drummer Man

265,Polk Salad Annie,"[Verse 1]
Some of you all never been down South too much
I'm going to tell you a little story, so you'll understand where I'm talking about
Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields
And it looks something like a turnip green
Everybody calls it Polk salad. Now that's Polk salad
Used to know a girl that lived down there and
She'd go out in the evenings to pick a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper, because that's about all they had to eat
But they did all right

Down in Louisiana
Where the alligators grow so mean
Lived a girl that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

[Chorus]
Polk salad Annie
Alligators got your granny
Everybody said it was a shame
For the mama was working on the chain-gang
What a mean, vicious woman

[Verse 2]
Everyday before suppertime
She'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of Polk salad
And carry it home in a tote sack

[Chorus]
Polk salad Annie
Alligators got you granny
Everybody said it was a shame
Because the mama was working on the chain-gang
Whoo, how wretched, despiteful, straight-razor toting woman
Lord have mercy

Sock a little Polk salad to him
Yeah, you know what, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
But daddy was a lazy and a no-count
Claimed he had a bad back
All her brothers were fit for
Was stealing watermelons out of my truck

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention
You sock a little
Hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Chic a bon, chic a bon, chic a bon bon bon bon
Sock a little Polk salad to him
You know what meets a meal mention

I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone

Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

269,Maybe The Rain Will Fall,"Just the other day, the other day
I was talking to the weatherman about today
Oh, Oh, Oh
And all, all he could say
Was no one knows tomorrow

See I can read the weather child
I can say maybe the rain will fall, the sun will shine
Oh, oh, oh
But that's as far as my guess goes

Cause no one knows tomorrow
Oh oh ah ha
No one knows tomorrow

Tell me what's the need to go to war
All the killings just to settle someone else's score
Oh, oh
When the victory isn't even sure
Oh, Oh
No one knows tomorrow

See, we can study history
And philosophy and Plato's ideology
Oh, oh, oh
But tomorrow's still a mystery

[Repeat x4]
No one knows tomorrow
Oh, oh, ah, ha

Tomorrow is your opportunity to fail
Or be successful if you please
Yes indeed
Tomorrow is a politician's today
It's the victim of decisions
And the future of our children

So when I die someday
Will I be in heavenly places
Singing Hallelujah with an angel on the piano
Or will I be just another contribution
To the earth, the trees, the grasses
As tomorrow slowly passes

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

278,Odds And Ends,"Now, I stand in awe and I shake my face
You break your promise all over the place
You promised to love me, but what do I see?
Just you comin’ in spilling juice over me
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again

Now, you take your file and you bend my head
I never can remember anything that you said
You promised to love me, but what do I know?
You’re always spilling juice on me like you got some place to go
Odds and ends, odds and ends
Lost time is not found again

Now, I’ve had enough, my box is clean
You know what I’m saying and you know what I mean
From now on you’d best get on someone else
While you’re doing it, keep that juice to yourself

279,Change Of Heart,"Are we awake?
Am I too old to be this stoned?
Was it your breasts from the start?
They played a part

For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart

I'll quote ""on the road"" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

You smashed a glass into pieces
That's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette

You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet

And she said, ""I've been so worried about you lately
You look shit and you smell a bit
You're mad thinking you could ever save me
Not looking like that""

You used to have a face straight out of a magazine
Now you just look like anyone
I just had a change of heart

I feel as though I was deceived
I never found love in the city
I just sat in self-pity and cried in the car
Oh I just had a change of heart

Then she said, ""I've been so worried 'bout you lately
You were fit but you're losing it
You played a part, 'this is how it starts'""
Oh, I just had a change of heart
​
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
I just had a change of heart
Oh, I just had a change of heart

280,Simple Song Of Freedom,"Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

Hey there, mister black man, can you hear me?
I don't want your diamonds or your game
I just wanna be someone known to you as me
And I will bet my life you want the same

Come and sing the simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

Seven hundred million are you listenin'
Most of what you read is made of lies
But, Speakin' one to one ain't it everybody's sun
To wake to in the mornin' when we rise?

Come and sing a simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

Brother Solzhenitsyn are you busy?
If not, won't you drop this friend a line?
Tell me if the man who is plowin' up your land
Has got the war machine upon his mind?

Come and sing the simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war

Now, no doubt some folks enjoy doin' battle
Like presidents, prime ministers and kings
So, let's all build them shelves
Where they can fight among themselves
Leave the people be who love to sing

Come and sing the simple song of freedom
Sing it like you've never sung before
Let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people here, don't want a war
I said let it fill the air
Tell the people everywhere
We the people, here don't want a war

[Verse 1]
How can it be
She wrote her number down its here in front of me
Don't understand, she must have told me a lie
I wonder why

[Verse 2]
We felt so right
How could I know that it would last for just a night
I can't believe, this could happen to me
But I can see

[Chorus]
It was a one night affair
I can still feel the warmth of her hair
Just one night to share
And I fell so in love with the girl who turned out to be a one
One night affair
And she'll never know how much I really care
What am I gonna do
I don't know what to do

[Verse 3]
One night affair
It only happened by some chance that we were there
You know that love filled the air
For a moment in time
She was mine

[Verse 4]
We felled so strong
I thought I found the love I've waited for so long
But I was wrong
I'll never she her again

[Chorus]
It was a one night affair
I can still feel the warmth of her hair
Just one night to share
And I fell so in love with the girl who turned out to be a one
One night affair
And she'll never know how much I really care
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
I don't know what to do

Swam around swam around started to float
Floated 'round 'round came in on the flow
There I found, there I found Sausalito

Drinkin' pea-green it's all in the view (need help with this line!)
Every shade marmalade every hue
Houses on stilts grow out of the sea
Everything's growin' there, it's growin' for me

You gotta go there, everything grows there
When you get high on a mountain it snows there
Everything's groovy like in a movie
Sausalito is the place to go to

Sunnin' all day, lovin'all night
Write a bit, fight a bit got it just right
Music and flowers the sight and the sound
Fish a bit, wish a bit magic's all 'round

It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance

Between the parted pages and were pressed
In love's hot fevered iron

All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees

The birds like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers
By the trees

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'Cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me
Looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one

I will take my life into my hands
And I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes
And I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky
And after all the loves of my life
Oh after all the loves in my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet green icing flowing down
Someone left the cake out in the rain

304,Farewell Love Scene,"CHAPTER XIII.

MARRIAGE.

The style of courtship which prevailed in Shakespeare's time, and the numerous customs associated with the marriage ceremony, may be accurately drawn from the many allusions interspersed through his plays. From these, it would seem that the mode of love-making was much the same amongst all classes, often lacking that polish and refined expression which are distinguishing characteristics now-a-days. As Mr Drake remarks, the amatory dialogues of Hamlet, Hotspur, and Henry the Fifth, are not more refined than those which occur between Master Fenton and Anne Page in the ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" between Lorenzo and Jessica in the ""Merchant of Venice,"" and between Orlando and Rosalind in ""As You Like It."" These last, which may be considered as instances taken from the middle class of life, together with a few drawn from the lower rank of rural manners, such as the courtship of Touchstone and Audrey, and of Silvius and Phoebe, in ""As You Like It,"" are good illustrations of this subject, although it must be added, that in point of fancy, sentiment, and simplicity, the most pleasing love scenes in Shakespeare are those of Romeo and Juliet, and of Florizel and Perdita.

The ancient ceremony of betrothing seems still to have been in full use in Shakespeare's day. Indeed, he gives us several interesting passages upon the subject of troth-plight. Thus, in ""Measure for Measure,"" (iii. 1), we learn that the unhappiness of the poor, dejected Mariana was caused by a violation of the troth-plight:—

""Duke. She should this Angelo have married; was affianced to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
Isab. Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

Duke. Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is washed with them, but relents not.""

It is evident that Angelo and Mariana were bound by oath, the nuptial was appointed; there was a prescribed time between the contract and the performance of the solemnity of the Church. The lady, however, having lost her dowry, the contract was violated by her ""combinate"" or affianced husband—the oath, no doubt, having been tendered by a minister of the Church in the presence of witnesses. In ""Twelfth Night"" (iv. 3), we have a minute description of such a ceremonial; for when Olivia is hastily espoused to Sebastian, she says—

""Now go with me and with this holy man
Into the chauntry by: there, before him,
And underneath that consecrated roof,
Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
May live at peace. He shall conceal it,
Whiles you are willing it shall come to note;
What time we will our celebration keep
According to my birth.""

This, then, was a private ceremony before a single witness, who would conceal it till the proper period of the public ceremonial. Olivia, fancying that she has thus espoused the page, repeatedly calls him ""husband;"" and, being rejected, she summons the priest to declare (v. 1)—

""What thou dost know
Hath newly pass’d between this youth and me.""
The priest answers—

""A contract of eternal bond of love,
Confirm’d by mutual joinder of your hands,
Attested by the holy close of lips,
Strengthen’d by interchangement of your rings:
And all the ceremony of this compact
Seal’d in my function, by my testimony:
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
I have travell’d but two hours.""

Again, in the ""Winter's Tale"" (iv. 4), which contains many a perfect picture of real rustic life, it appears that occasionally the troth-plight was exchanged without the presence of a priest; but that witnesses were essential to the ceremony

""Florizel.              O, hear me breathe my life
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
Hath sometime loved. I take thy hand, this hand,
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann’d snow that's bolted
By the northern blasts twice o’er.
Polixenes. What follows this?—
How prettily the young swain seems to wash
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
But to your protestation; let me hear
What you profess.
Flor. Do, and be witness to ’t.
Pol. And this my neighbour too?
Flor.                        And he, and more
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all;
That, were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
Without her love; for her employ them all;
Commend them and condemn them to her service,
Or to their own perdition.
Pol.                        Fairly offer'd.
Cam. This shows a sound affection.
Shep.                       But, my daughter,
Say you the like to him?
Per.                        I cannot speak
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
The purity of his.
Shep.                        Take hands, a bargain!
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to ’t:
I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.
Flor.                        O, that must be
I’ the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
Contract us ’fore these witnesses.
Shep.                       Come, your hand;
And, daughter, yours.""
To the argument of Polixenes, that the father of Florizel ought to know of his proceeding, the young man answers—

""Flor.              Come, come, he must not:
Mark our contract.""
And then the father, discovering himself, exclaims—

""Mark your divorce, young sir.""

Here, then, as Mr Knight remarks,  in the publicity of a village festival, the hand of the loved one is solemnly taken by her lover, who breathes his life before the ancient stranger who is accidentally present. The stranger is called to be a witness to the protestation, and so is the neighbour who has come with him. The maiden is called upon by her father to speak, and then the old man adds—

""Take hands, a bargain!""
The friends are to bear witness to it—

""I give my daughter to him, and will make
Her portion equal his.""

The impatient lover then again exclaims—

""Contract us ’fore these witnesses.""

The shepherd takes the hand of the youth and the maiden. Again the lover exclaims—

""Mark our contract.""

The ceremony is left incomplete, for the princely father discovers himself with—

""Mark your divorce, young sir.""

It appears, therefore, that espousals before witnesses were considered as constituting a valid marriage, if followed up within a limited time by the marriage of the Church. However much the Reformed Church might have endeavoured to abrogate this practice, it was unquestionably the ancient habit of the people.  It was derived from the Roman law, and still prevails in the Lutheran Church.

Besides exchanging kisses, accompanied with vows of everlasting affection and whispering lovers’ reassurances of fidelity, it was customary to interchange rings. In Shakespeare's plays, however, espousals are made with and without the use of the ring. Thus, in the case of Ferdinand and Miranda, we read of their joining hands only (""Tempest,"" iii. 1)—

""Ferd. Ay, with a heart as willing
As bondage e’er of freedom; here's my hand.
Mir. And mine, with my heart in’t; and now farewell
Till half an hour hence.""

In the passage already quoted from ""Twelfth Night"" (v. 1) there seems to have been a mutual interchange of rings.

Some, indeed, considered that a betrothal was not complete unless each spouse gave the other a circlet. Lady Anne, in ""Richard III."" (i. 2), is made to share in this misconception:—

""Gloster. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
Anne. To take is not to give.
Gloster. Look, how this ring encompasseth thy finger,
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart:
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.""
In ""Two Gentlemen of Verona"" (ii. 2), we read:—

""Julia. Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake, (giving a ring).
Proteus. Why, then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
Julia. And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.""

A joint,or gimmal ring, was anciently a common token among lovers; an allusion to which is made by Emilia in ""Othello"" (iv. 3): ""I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring."" Their nature will be best understood by a passage in Dryden's ""Don Sebastian,"" 1690 (act v.):—

""A curious artist wrought them,
With joints so close, as not to be perceiv’d;
Yet are they both each other's counterpart,
and in the midst,
A heart divided in two halves was plac’d.""

They were generally made of two or three hoops, so chased and engraved that when fastened together by a single rivet, the whole three formed one design—the usual device being a hand. When an engagement was contracted the ring was taken apart, each spouse taking a division, and the third one being presented to the principal witness of the contract.  Hence such a ring was known as a ""Sponsalium Annulis,"" to which Herrick thus refers:—

""Thou sent’st me a true-love knot, but I
Returned a ring of jimmals, to imply
Thy love hath one knot, mine a triple tye.""

The term is used by the Duke of Anjou, in ""1 Henry VI."" (i. 2):—

""I think, by some old gimmors or device
Their arms are set like clocks, still to strike on;
Else ne’er could they hold out so as they do.""

Again in ""Henry V."" (iv. 2), Grandpré tells how:—

""In their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
Lies foul with chew’d grass, still and motionless.""

Most readers of the ""Merchant of Venice,"" remember the mirthful use which Shakespeare makes of lover's rings. Portia says (iii. 2), when giving her wealth and self to Bassanio.

""I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love.

The last act, too, gives several particulars about lovers’ rings, which in Elizabethan England, often had posies engraved on them, and were worn by men on the left hand. Gratiano, for example, says:—

""About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world's like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me and leave me not.""

Again Bassiano exclaims:—

""Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,
And swear I lost the ring defending it.""

In ""Taming of the Shrew,"" Shakespeare gives numerous allusions to the customs of his day connected with courtship and marriage. Indeed, in the Second Act (2), we have a perfect betrothal scene:—

""Petruchio. Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel ’gainst the wedding day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests:
I will be sure my Katharine shall be fine.
Baptista. I know not what to say; but give me your hands;
God send you joy, Petruchio, ’tis a match.
Gremio and Tranio. Amen, say we; we will be witnesses.
Petruchio. Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
I will to Venice, Sunday comes apace;
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o’ Sunday.""

Although Katharina is only his spouse, and Baptista not yet his father-in-law, Petruchio in accordance with fashion calls her ""wife"" and him ""father."" The spouses of old times used to term one another ""husband"" and ""wife,"" for, as they argued, they were as good as husband and wife.


Formerly there was a kind of betrothal or marriage contract prevalent among the lower orders, called ""hand-fasting,"" or ""hand-festing,"" said to have been much in use among the Danes, and which is mentioned by Ray in his ""Glossary of Northumbrian Words."" It simply means hand-fastening or binding. In ""Cymbeline"" (i. 5), the phrase is used in its secondary sense by the Queen, who, speaking of Pisanio, declares that he is—

""A sly and constant knave,
Not to be shaked; the agent for his master,
And the remembrancer of her to hold
The hand-fast to her lord.""

In the ""Christian State of Matrimony,"" 1543, we find the following illustration of this custom: ""Yet in this thing almost must I warn every reasonable and honest person to beware that in the contracting of marriage they dissemble not, nor set forth any lie. Every man, likewise, must esteem the person to whom he is 'handfasted' none otherwise than for his own spouse; though as yet it be not done in the church, nor in the street. After the handfasting and making of the contract, the church-going and wedding should not be deferred too long."" The author then goes on to rebuke a custom, ""that at the handfasting there is made a great feast and superfluous banquet."" Sir John Sinclair, in the ""Statistical Account of Scotland,"" (1794, xii. 615), tells us that at a fair annually held at Eskdalemuir, Co. Dumfries, ""it was the custom for the unmarried persons of both sexes to choose a companion according to their liking, with whom they were to live till that time next year. This was called 'handfasting,' or hand-in-fist. If they were pleased with each other at that time then they continued together for life; if not, they separated, and were free to make another choice as at the first.""

Shakespeare has given us numerous illustrations of the marriage customs of our forefathers, many of which are interesting as relics of the past, owing to their having long ago fallen into disuse. The fashion of introducing a bowl of wine into the church at a wedding, which is alluded to in the ""Taming of the Shrew,"" (iii. 2), to be drunk by the bride and bridegroom and persons present immediately after the marriage ceremony, is very ancient. Gremio relates how Petruchio,—

""Stamp’d and swore,
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
But after many ceremonies done,
He calls for wine:—""A health,"" quoth he, as if
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
After a storm,—quaff’d off the muscadel,
And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
Having no other reason
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly,
And seem’d to ask him sops as he was drinking.""

It existed even among our Gothic ancestors, and is mentioned in the ordinances of the household of Henry VII., ""For the Marriage of a Princess:—'Then pottes of ipocrice to be ready, and to be put into cupps with soppe, and to be borne to the estates, and to take a soppe and drinke.""  It was also practised at the magnificent marriage of Queen Mary and Philip, in Winchester Cathedral, and at the marriage of the Elector Palatine to the daughter of James I., in 1612–13. Indeed, it appears to have been the practice at most marriages. In Jonson's ""Magnetic Lady"" it is called a ""knitting cup""; in Middleton's ""No Wit like a Woman's"" the ""contracting cup."" In Robert Armin's comedy of ""The History of the Two Maids of More Clacke,"" 1609, the play begins with,

""Enter a maid strewing flowers, and a serving-man perfuming the door.
Maid. Strew, strew.
Man. The muscadine stays for the bride at church:
The priest and Hymen's ceremonies tend
To make them man and wife.""

Again, in Beaumont and Fletcher's ""Scornful Lady,"" (i. 1), the custom is referred to 2:—

""If my wedding smock were on,
Were the gloves bought and given, the licence come,
Were the rosemary branches dipp’d, and all
The hippocras and cakes eat and drunk off.""


We find it enjoined in the Hereford Missal. By the Sarum missal it is directed that the sops immersed in this wine, as well as the liquor itself, and the cup that contained it, should be blessed by the priest. The beverage used on this occasion was to be drunk by the bride and bridegroom and the rest of the company.

The nuptial kiss in the church was anciently part of the marriage ceremony, as appears from a rubric in one of the Salisbury missals. In the ""Taming of the Shrew,"" Shakespeare has made an excellent use of this custom, where he relates how Petruchio (iii. 2)

""Took the bride about the neck
And kiss’d her lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo.""

Again, in ""King Richard II."" (v. r), where the Duke of Northumberland announces to the king that he is to be sent to Pomfret, and his wife to be banished to France, the king exclaims—

""Doubly divorced!—Bad men, you violate
A twofold marriage,—’twixt my crown and me,
And then betwixt me and my married wife.
Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me;
And yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made.""

Marston, too, in his ""Insatiate Countess,"" mentions it—

""The kisse thou gav’st me in the church, here take.""

The practice is still kept up among the poor; and Brand says it is ""still customary among persons of middling rank as well as the vulgar, in most parts of England, for the young men present at the marriage ceremony to salute the bride, one by one, the moment it is concluded.""

Music was the universal accompaniment of weddings in olden times. The allusions to wedding music that may be found in the works of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and other Elizabethan dramatists, testify, as Mr Jeaffreson points out, that, in the opinion of their contemporaries, a wedding without the braying of trumpets, and beating of drums, and clashing of cymbals, was a poor affair. In ""As You Like It"" (v. 4), Hymen says—

""Whiles a wedlock hymn we sing.""

And in ""Romeo and Juliet"" (iv. 5) Capulet says—

""Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change.""

It seems to have been customary for the bride at her wedding to wear her hair unbraided and hanging loose over her shoulders. There may be an allusion to this custom in ""King John"" (iii. 1) where Constance says—

""O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.""

At the celebration of her marriage with the Palatine, Elizabeth Stuart wore ""her hair dishevelled and hanging down her shoulders."" Heywood speaks of this practice in the following graphic words—

""At length the blushing bride comes, with her hair
Dishevelled ’bout her shoulders.""

It has been suggested that the bride's veil, which of late years has become one of the most conspicuous features of her costume, may be nothing more than a milliner's substitute, which in old time concealed not a few of the bride's personal attractions, and covered her face when she knelt at the altar. Mr Jeaffreson thinks it may be ascribed to the Hebrew ceremony; or has come from the East, where veils have been worn from time immemorial. Some again connect it with the yellow veil which was worn by the Roman brides. Strange, too, as it may appear, it is nevertheless certain that knives and daggers were formerly part of the customary accoutrements of brides. Thus, Shakespeare, in the old quarto, 1597, makes Juliet wear a knife at the friar's cell, and when she is about to take the potion. This custom, however, is easily accounted for, when we consider that women anciently wore a knife suspended from their girdle. Many allusions to this practice occur in old writers. In Dekker's ""Match Me in London,"" 1631, a bride says to her jealous husband—

""See at my girdle hang my wedding knives!
With those dispatch me.""

In the ""Witch of Edmonton,"" 1658, Somerton says—

""But see, the bridegroom and bride come; the new
Pair of Sheffield knives fitted both to one sheath.""

Among other wedding customs alluded to by Shakespeare we may mention one referred to in ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1), where Katharine, speaking of Bianca, says to her father—

""She is your treasure, she must have a husband:
I must dance bare-foot on the wedding-day,
And, for your love to her, lead apes in hell,""

it being a popular notion that unless the elder sisters danced barefoot at the marriage of a younger one, they would inevitably become old maids, and be condemned ""to lead apes in hell."" The expression ""to lead apes in hell,"" applied above to old maids, has given rise to much discussion, and the phrase has not yet been satisfactorily explained. Steevens suggests that it might be considered an act of posthumous retribution for women who refused to bear children, to be condemned to the care of apes in leading strings after death. Malone says that ""to lead apes"" was in Shakespeare's time one of the employments of a bear-ward, who often carried about one of these animals with his bear."" Nares explains the expression by reference to the word ape as denoting a fool, it probably meaning that those coquettes who made fools of men, and led them about without real intention of marriage, would have them still to lead against their will hereafter. In ""Much Ado about Nothing"" (ii. 1), Beatrice says, ""Therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell."" Douce  tells us that homicides and adulterers were in ancient times compelled, by way of punishment, to lead an ape by the neck, with their mouths affixed in a very unseemly manner to the animal's tail.

In accordance with an old custom, the bride on the wedding night had to dance with every guest, and play the amiable, however much against her own wishes. In ""Henry VIII."" (v. 2), there seems to be an allusion to this practice, where the King says—

""I had thought
They had parted so much honesty among ’em,
At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer
A man of his place, and so near our favour,
To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,"" etc.

In the ""Christian State of Matrimony"" (1543), we read thus:—""Then must the poor bryde kepe foote with a dauncers, and refuse none, how scabbed, foule, droncken, rude, and shameless soever he be.""

As in our own time, so, too, formerly flowers entered largely into the marriage festivities. Most readers will at once call to mind that touching scene (iv. 5) in ""Romeo and Juliet,"" where Capulet says, referring to Juliet's supposed untimely death—

""Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse.""

It seems, too, in days gone by to have been customary to deck the bridal bed with flowers, various allusions to which are given by Shakespeare. Thus, in ""Hamlet"" (v. 1), the Queen, speaking of poor Ophelia, says—

""I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid.""

In the ""Tempest"" (iv. 1), we may compare the words of Prospero, who, alluding to the marriage of his daughter Miranda with Ferdinand, by way of warning, cautions them lest—

""Barren hate,
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
That you shall hate it both.""

In the Papal times no new married couple could go to bed together till the bridal-bed had been blessed—this being considered one of the most important of the marriage ceremonies. ""On the evening of the wedding day,"" says Mr Jeaffreson, ""when the married couple sat in state in the bridal-bed, before the exclusion of the guests, who assembled to commend them yet again to Heaven's keeping, one or more priests attended by acolytes swinging to and fro lighted censors, appeared in the crowded chamber to bless the couch, its occupants, and the truckle-bed, and fumigate the room with hallowing incense."" In ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (v. 1), Oberon says:—

""Now, until the break of day,
Through the house each fairy stray.
To the best bride-bed will we,
Which by us shall blessed be
And the issue they create
Ever shall be fortunate.""

Steevens in illustration of this custom quotes from Chaucer's ""The Merchant's Tale"" (ed. Tyrrwhitt), line 9693:—

""And when the bed was with the preest yblessed.""

The formula for this curious ceremony is thus given in the Manual for the use of Salisbury:—""Nocte vero sequente cum sponsus et sponsa ad lectum pervenerint, accedat sacerdos et benedicat thalamum, dicens. Benedic, Domine, thalamum istum et omnes habitantes in eo; ut in tua pace consistant, et in tua voluntate pernaneant: et in tuo amore vivant et senescant et multiplicentur in longitudine dierum. Per Dominum.—Item benedictio super lectum. Benedic, Domine, hoc cubiculum, respice, quinon dormis neque dormitas. Qui custodis Israel, custodi famulos tuos in hoc lecto quiescentes ab omnibus fantasmaticis demonum illusionibus. Custodi eos vigilantes ut in preceptis tuis meditentur dormientes, et te per soporem sentiant; ut hic et ubique depensionis tuæ muniantur auxilio. Per Dominum—Deinde fiat benedictio super eos in lecto tantum cum oremus. Benedicat Deus corpora vestra et animas vestras; et det super eos benedictionem sicut benedixit Abraham, Isaac, et Jacob, Amen.—His peractis aspergat eos aqua benedicta, et sic discedat et dimittat eos in pace.""



In the French romance of Melusine, the Bishop who marries her to Raymondin blesses the nuptial bed. The ceremony is there presented in a very ancient cut, of which Douce has given a copy. The good prelate is sprinkling the parties with holy water. It appears that, occasionally during the benediction, the married couple only sat on the bed; but they generally received a portion of the consecrated bread and wine. It is recorded in France, that, on frequent occasions, the priest was improperly detained till midnight, while the wedding guests rioted in the luxuries of the table, and made use of language that was extremely offensive to the clergy. It was therefore ordained, in the year 1577, that the ceremony of blessing the nuptial bed should for the future be performed in the day-time, or at least before supper, and in the presence of the bride and bridegroom, and of their nearest relations only.

On the morning after the celebration of the marriage, it was formerly customary for friends to serenade a newly married couple, or to greet them with a morning song to bid them good morrow. In ""Othello"" (iii. i), this custom is referred to by Cassio, who speaking of Othello and Desdemona, says to the musicians:—

""Masters, play here, I will content your pains;
Something that's brief; and bid—'Good morrow, general.""

According to Cotgrave, the morning-song to a newly married woman was called the ""hunt's up."" It has been suggested that this may be alluded to by Juliet (iii. 5) who, when urging Romeo to make his escape tells him—

""Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes;
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day.
O, now be gone.""

In olden times torches were used at weddings—a practice, indeed, dating as far back as the time of the Romans. From the following lines in Herrick's ""Hesperides,"" it has been suggested that the custom once existed in this country

""Upon a maid that dyed the day she was marryed
That morne which saw me made a bride,
The eve’ning witnest that I dy’d.
Those holy lights, wherewith they guide
Unto the bed the bashful bride,
Serv’d but as tapers for to burne
And light my reliques to their urne.
This epitaph which here you see,
Supply’d the Epithalamie.""

Shakespeare alludes to this custom in ""1 Henry VI."" (iii. 2), where Joan of Arc, thrusting out a burning torch on the top of the tower at Rouen, exclaims—

""Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen.""

In ""Tempest,"" too, (iv. 1), Iris says—

""No bed-right shall be paid
Till Hymen's torch be lighted.""
According to a Roman marriage custom, the bride on her entry into her husband's house was prohibited from treading over his threshold, and lest she should even so much as touch it, she was always lifted over it. Shakespeare seems inadvertently to have overlooked this usage in ""Coriolanus"" (iv. 5), where he represents Aufidius as saying to Coriolanus:—

""I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh’d truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold.""
Lucan in his ""Pharsalia"" (lib. ii. 359), says:—

""Translata vetuit contingere limina planta.""

Once more, Sunday appears to have been a popular day for marriages; the brides of the Elizabethan dramas being usually represented as married on Sundays. In the ""Taming of the Shrew"" (ii. 1), Petruchio after telling his future father-in-law ""that upon Sunday is the wedding-day,"" and laughing at Katharine's petulant exclamation, ""I'll see thee hanged on Sunday first,"" says:—

""Father, and wife, and gentlemen adieu;
I will to Venice, Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and give array;
And, kiss me Kate, we will be married o’ Sunday.""

Thus, Mr Jeaffreson, speaking of this custom in his ""Brides and Bridals,"" rightly remarks,—""A fashionable wedding, celebrated on the Lord's Day in London, or any part of England, would now-a-days be denounced by religious people of all Christian parties. But in our feudal times, and long after the Reformation, Sunday was of all days of the week the favourite one for marriages. Long after the theatres had been closed on Sundays, the day of rest was the chief day for weddings with Londoners of every social class.""

Love charms have from the earliest times been much in request amongst the credulous anxious to gain an insight into their matrimonial prospects. 1 In the ""Merchant of Venice,"" (v. 1), we have an allusion to the practice of kneeling and praying at wayside crosses for a happy marriage, in the passage where Stephano tells how his mistress

""Doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.""

The use of love potions by a despairing lover to secure the affections of another was a superstitious practice much resorted to in olden times. This mode of enchantment, too, was formerly often employed in our own country, and Gay, in his ""Shepherd's Week,"" relates how Hobnelia was guilty of this questionable practice:—

""As I was wont, I trudged, last market-day,
To town with new-laid eggs, preserved in hay.
I made my market long before ’twas night;
My purse grew heavy, and my basket light.
Straight to the ’pothecary's shop I went,
And in love-powder all my money spent.
Behap what will, next Sunday after prayers,
When to the ale-house Lubberkin repairs,
These golden flies into his mug I'll throw,
And soon the swain with fervent love shall glow.""

In the ""Character of a Quack Astrologer,"" 1673, quoted by Brand, we are told how ""he trappans a young heiress to run away with a footman, by persuading a young girl ’tis her destiny; and sells the old and ugly philtres and love-powder to procure them sweet-hearts."" Shakespeare has represented Othello as accused of winning Desdemona ""by conjuration and mighty magic."" Thus Brabantio (i. 2), says:—

""Thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
That waken motion.""

And in the following scene he further repeats the same charge against Othello:—

""She is abused, stol’n from me, and corrupted
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
For nature so preposterously to err,
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
Sans witchcraft could not.""

Othello, however, in proving that he had won Desdemona only by honourable means, addressing the Duke, replies,—

""By your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjurations and what mighty magic,
For such proceeding I am charged withal,
I won his daughter.""

It may have escaped the poet's notice that, by the Venetian law, the giving love-potions was held highly criminal, as appears in the code ""Della Promission del Malefico,"" cap. xvii., ""Dei Maleficii et Herbarie.""

A further allusion to this practice occurs in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (ii. 1), where Puck and Oberon amuse themselves at Titania's expense.

An expression common in Shakespeare's day for any one born out of wedlock is mentioned by the Bastard in ""King John"" (i. 1)—

""In at the window, or else o’er the hatch.""
The old saying also that ""hanging and wives go by destiny,"" is quoted by Nerissa in the ""Merchant of Venice"" (ii. 9). In ""Much Ado about Nothing"" (ii. 1), Don Pedro makes use of an old popular phrase in asking Claudio, ""When mean you to go to church?"" referring to his marriage.

A solemn and even melancholy air was often affected by the beaux of Queen Elizabeth's time, as a refined mark of gentility, a most sad and pathetic allusion to which custom is made by Arthur in ""King John"" (iv. 1)—

""Methinks, nobody should be sad but I:
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
Only for wantonness.""

There are frequent references to this fashion in our old writers. Thus, in Ben Jonson's ""Every Man in His Humour"" (i. 3), we read:—""Why, I do think of it; and I will be more proud, and melancholy, and gentlemanlike than I have been, I'll insure you.""",T.F. Thiselton Dyer,1969,"[86, 87, 96, 98]",4

317,"Yesterday, When I Was Young","[Verse 1]
Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me and nothing else at all

[Verse 3]
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play

[Outro]
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday

318,Color Him Father,"There's a man at my house, he's so big and strong
He goes to work each day, and he stays all day long

He comes home each night looking tired and beat
He sits down at the dinner table and has a bite to eat

Never a frown always a smile
When he says to me: ""How's my child?""
I said that I've been studying hard all day in school
Tryin' very hard to understand the golden rule

I think I'll color this man father
I think I'll color him love
Said I'm gonna color him father
I think I'll color the man love, yes I will

He says education is the thing if you want to compete
Because without it son, life ain't very sweet
I love this man and I don't know why
Except I'll need his strength until the day that I die

My mother loves him and I can tell
By the way she looks at him when he holds my little sister Nell
I heard her say just the other day
That if it hadn't of been for him she couldn't have found her way

I think I'll color him father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I think I'll color this man love

Our real old man he got killed in the war
And she knows she and seven kids couldn't of gotten very far
She said she thought that she could never love again
And then there he stood with that big wide grin
He married my mother and he took us in
And now we belong to the man with that big wide grin

I've got to color this man father
I'm gonna color him love
I've got to color him father
I believe I'll color this man love

He's just been so good to me
I know I've got to color him love

324,On Campus,"> From Rugby Road to Vinegar Hill, we're gonna get drunk tonight
The faculty's afraid of us, they know we're in the right
So fill up your cups, your loving cups, as full as full can be
As long as love and liquor last, we'll drink to the U of V
—""Rugby Road,"" traditional University of Virginia fight song

Sipping from a plastic cup, Jackie grimaced, then discreetly spilled her spiked punch onto the sludgy fraternity-house floor. The University of Virginia freshman wasn't a drinker, but she didn't want to seem like a goody-goody at her very first frat party – and she especially wanted to impress her date, the handsome Phi Kappa Psi brother who'd brought her here. Jackie was sober but giddy with discovery as she looked around the room crammed with rowdy strangers guzzling beer and dancing to loud music. She smiled at her date, whom we'll call Drew, a good-looking junior – or in UVA parlance, a third-year – and he smiled enticingly back.

""Want to go upstairs, where it's quieter?"" Drew shouted into her ear, and Jackie's heart quickened. She took his hand as he threaded them out of the crowded room and up a staircase.

Four weeks into UVA's 2012 school year, 18-year-old Jackie was crushing it at college. A chatty, straight-A achiever from a rural Virginia town, she'd initially been intimidated by UVA's aura of preppy success, where throngs of toned, tanned and overwhelmingly blond students fanned across a landscape of neoclassical brick buildings, hurrying to classes, clubs, sports, internships, part-time jobs, volunteer work and parties; Jackie's orientation leader had warned her that UVA students' schedules were so packed that ""no one has time to date – people just hook up."" But despite her reservations, Jackie had flung herself into campus life, attending events, joining clubs, making friends and, now, being asked on an actual date. She and Drew had met while working lifeguard shifts together at the university pool, and Jackie had been floored by Drew's invitation to dinner, followed by a ""date function"" at his fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi. The ""upper tier"" frat had a reputation of tremendous wealth, and its imposingly large house overlooked a vast manicured field, giving ""Phi Psi"" the undisputed best real estate along UVA's fraternity row known as Rugby Road.

Jackie had taken three hours getting ready, straightening her long, dark, wavy hair. She'd congratulated herself on her choice of a tasteful red dress with a high neckline. Now, climbing the frat-house stairs with Drew, Jackie felt excited. Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them. The room was pitch-black inside. Jackie blindly turned toward Drew, uttering his name. At that same moment, she says, she detected movement in the room – and felt someone bump into her. Jackie began to scream.

""Shut up,"" she heard a man's voice say as a body barreled into her, tripping her backward and sending them both crashing through a low glass table. There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh. For a hopeful moment Jackie wondered if this wasn't some collegiate prank. Perhaps at any second someone would flick on the lights and they'd return to the party.

""Grab its motherfucking leg,"" she heard a voice say. And that's when Jackie knew she was going to be raped.

She remembers every moment of the next three hours of agony, during which, she says, seven men took turns raping her, while two more – her date, Drew, and another man – gave instruction and encouragement. She remembers how the spectators swigged beers, and how they called each other nicknames like Armpit and Blanket. She remembers the men's heft and their sour reek of alcohol mixed with the pungency of marijuana. Most of all, Jackie remembers the pain and the pounding that went on and on.

As the last man sank onto her, Jackie was startled to recognize him: He attended her tiny anthropology discussion group. He looked like he was going to cry or puke as he told the crowd he couldn't get it up. ""Pussy!"" the other men jeered. ""What, she's not hot enough for you?"" Then they egged him on: ""Don't you want to be a brother?"" ""We all had to do it, so you do, too."" Someone handed her classmate a beer bottle. Jackie stared at the young man, silently begging him not to go through with it. And as he shoved the bottle into her, Jackie fell into a stupor, mentally untethering from the brutal tableau, her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor.

When Jackie came to, she was alone. It was after 3 a.m. She painfully rose from the floor and ran shoeless from the room. She emerged to discover the Phi Psi party still surreally under way, but if anyone noticed the barefoot, disheveled girl hurrying down a side staircase, face beaten, dress spattered with blood, they said nothing. Disoriented, Jackie burst out a side door, realized she was lost, and dialed a friend, screaming, ""Something bad happened. I need you to come and find me!"" Minutes later, her three best friends on campus – two boys and a girl (whose names are changed) – arrived to find Jackie on a nearby street corner, shaking. ""What did they do to you? What did they make you do?"" Jackie recalls her friend Randall demanding. Jackie shook her head and began to cry. The group looked at one another in a panic. They all knew about Jackie's date; the Phi Kappa Psi house loomed behind them. ""We have to get her to the hospital,"" Randall said.

Their other two friends, however, weren't convinced. ""Is that such a good idea?"" she recalls Cindy asking. ""Her reputation will be shot for the next four years."" Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through. The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep. Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: ""She's gonna be the girl who cried 'rape,' and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.""

Two years later, Jackie, now a third-year, is worried about what might happen to her once this article comes out. Greek life is huge at UVA, with nearly one-third of undergrads belonging to a fraternity or sorority, so Jackie fears the backlash could be big – a ""shitshow"" predicted by her now-former friend Randall, who, citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed. But her concerns go beyond taking on her alleged assailants and their fraternity. Lots of people have discouraged her from sharing her story, Jackie tells me with a pained look, including the trusted UVA dean to whom Jackie reported her gang-rape allegations more than a year ago. On this deeply loyal campus, even some of Jackie's closest friends see her going public as tantamount to betrayal.

""One of my roommates said, 'Do you want to be responsible for something that's gonna paint UVA in a bad light?' "" says Jackie, poking at a vegan burger at a restaurant on the Corner, UVA's popular retail strip. ""But I said, 'UVA has flown under the radar for so long, someone has to say something about it, or else it's gonna be this system that keeps perpetuating!' "" Jackie frowns. ""My friend just said, 'You have to remember where your loyalty lies.'""

From reading headlines today, one might think colleges have suddenly become hotbeds of protest by celebrated anti-rape activists. But like most colleges across America, genteel University of Virginia has no radical feminist culture seeking to upend the patriarchy. There are no red-tape-wearing protests like at Harvard, no ""sex-positive"" clubs promoting the female orgasm like at Yale, no mattress-hauling performance artists like at Columbia, and certainly no SlutWalks. UVA isn't an edgy or progressive campus by any stretch. The pinnacle of its polite activism is its annual Take Back the Night vigil, which on this campus of 21,000 students attracts an audience of less than 500 souls. But the dearth of attention isn't because rape doesn't happen in Charlottesville. It's because at UVA, rapes are kept quiet, both by students – who brush off sexual assaults as regrettable but inevitable casualties of their cherished party culture – and by an administration that critics say is less concerned with protecting students than it is with protecting its own reputation from scandal. Some UVA women, so sickened by the university's culture of hidden sexual violence, have taken to calling it ""UVrApe.""

""University of Virginia thinks they're above the law,"" says UVA grad and victims-rights advocate Liz Seccuro. ""They go to such lengths to protect themselves. There's a national conversation about sexual assault, but nothing at UVA is changing.""

S. Daniel Carter, who as former director of public policy for the advocacy group Clery Center for Security on Campus is a national expert on college safety, points out that UVA's sexual assault problems are not much worse than other schools; if anything, he says, the depressing reality is that UVA's situation is likely the norm. Decades of awareness programming haven't budged the prevalence of campus rape: One in five women is sexually assaulted in college, though only about 12 percent report it to police. Spurred by a wave of activism, the Obama administration has stepped up pressure on colleges, announcing Title IX investigations of 86 schools suspected of denying students their equal right to education by inadequately handling sexual-violence complaints; if found in violation, each school runs the risk of financial penalties, including the nuclear option (which has never been deployed) of having its federal funding revoked.

The University of Virginia is one of the 86 schools now under federal investigation, but it has more reason to worry than most of its peers. Because, unlike most schools under scrutiny, where complaints are at issue, UVA is one of only 12 schools under a sweeping investigation known as ""compliance review"": a proactive probe launched by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights itself, triggered by concerns about deep-rooted issues. ""They are targeted efforts to go after very serious concerns,"" says Office of Civil Rights assistant secretary Catherine Lhamon. ""We don't open compliance reviews unless we have something that we think merits it.""

UVA says it has been complying fully with the investigation. But Carter notes that UVA and other elite schools tend not to respond well to criticism and sanctify tradition above all else. ""That's common to more prestigious institutions,"" Carter says.

Prestige is at the core of UVA's identity. Although a public school, its grounds of red-brick, white-columned buildings designed by founder Thomas Jefferson radiate old-money privilege, footnoted by the graffiti of UVA's many secret societies, whose insignias are neatly painted everywhere. At $10,000 a year, in-state tuition is a quarter the cost of the Ivies, but UVA tends to attract affluent students, and through aggressive fundraising boasts an endowment of $5 billion, on par with Cornell. ""Wealthy parents are the norm,"" says former UVA dean John Foubert. On top of all that, UVA enjoys a reputation as one of the best schools in the country, not to mention a campus so brimming with fun that in 2012 – the year of Jackie's rape – Playboy crowned it the nation's number-one party school. Students hold themselves up to that standard: studious by day, wild by night. ""The most impressive person at UVA is the person who gets straight A's and goes to all the parties,"" explains fourth-year student Brian Head. Partying traditions fuse the decorum of the Southern aristocracy with binge drinking: At Cavalier football tailgates, the dress code is ""girls in pearls, guys in ties"" while students guzzle handles of vodka. Not for nothing is a UVA student nicknamed a Wahoo, as undergrads like to explain; though derived from a long-ago yell from Cavalier fans, a wahoo is also a fish that can drink twice its own body weight.

Wahoos are enthralled to be at UVA and can't wait to tell you the reasons why, beginning, surprisingly, with Thomas Jefferson, whose lore is so powerfully woven into everyday UVA life that you practically expect to glimpse the man still walking the grounds in his waistcoat and pantaloons. Nearly every student I interviewed found a way to mention ""TJ,"" speaking with zeal about their founding father's vision for an ""academical village"" in the idyllic setting of the Blue Ridge Mountains. They burble about UVA's honor code, a solemn pledge not to lie, cheat or steal; students are expected to snitch on violators, who are expelled. UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault.

""Think about it,"" says Susan Russell, whose UVA daughter's sexual-assault report helped trigger a previous federal investigation. ""In what world do you get kicked out for cheating, but if you rape someone, you can stay?""

Attorney Wendy Murphy, who has filed Title IX complaints and lawsuits against schools including UVA, argues that in matters of sexual violence, Ivy League and Division I schools' fixation with prestige is their downfall. ""These schools love to pretend they protect the children as if they were their own, but that's not true: They're interested in money,"" Murphy says. ""In these situations, the one who gets the most protection is either a wealthy kid, a legacy kid or an athlete. The more privileged he is, the more likely the woman has to die before he's held accountable."" Indeed, UVA is the same campus where the volatile relationship of lacrosse star George Huguely V and his girlfriend Yeardley Love was seen as unremarkable – his jealous rages, fanned by over-the-top drinking – until the 2010 day he kicked open her door and beat her to death.

UVA president Teresa Sullivan denies the administration sweeps sexual assault under the rug. ""If we're trying to hide the issue, we're not doing a very good job of it,"" she says, noting that this past February UVA hosted the first-ever sexual-assault summit for college administrators. It's true that recently, while under close government scrutiny, the school has made some encouraging changes, including designating most UVA authority figures as mandatory reporters of sexual assault and teaming up with student activists to create a bystander-intervention campaign. Students praise UVA's deans as caring folks who answer late-night calls from victims and even make emergency-room visits.

And yet the UVA public-relations team seemed unenthused about this article, canceling my interview with the head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, and forbidding other administrators from cooperating; even students seemed infected by their anxiety about how members of the administration might appear. And when President Sullivan was at last made available for an interview, her most frequently invoked answer to my specific questions about sexual-assault handling at UVA – while two other UVA staffers sat in on the recorded call – was ""I don't know.""

Two weeks after Jackie's rape, she ran into Drew during her lifeguard shift at the UVA pool. ""Hey, Jackie,"" Drew said, startling her. ""Are you ignoring me?"" She'd switched her shift in the hopes of never seeing him again. Since the Phi Kappa Psi party, she'd barely left her dorm room, fearful of glimpsing one of her attackers. Jackie stared at Drew, unable to speak. ""I wanted to thank you for the other night,"" Drew said. ""I had a great time.""

Jackie left her shift early, saying she wasn't feeling well. Then she walked back to her dorm and crawled under the covers. She didn't go to classes for the rest of the week, and soon quit her lifeguarding job – the first time she could remember quitting anything. She would never again return to the Anthropology course she shared with one of her assailants. She was constantly on the edge of panic, plagued by flashbacks – and disgusted by her own naiveté. She obsessed over what easy prey she'd been, as the attention-starved freshman who for weeks drank up Drew's flirtations. ""I still grapple with 'Did I do something that could have been construed as that's what I wanted?' "" she says.

Before Jackie left for college, her parents – a Vietnam vet and retired military contractor, and a stay-at-home mom – had lectured her about avoiding the perils of the social scene, stressing the importance of her studies, since Jackie hoped to get into medical school. Jackie had a strained relationship with her father, in whose eyes she'd never felt good enough, and always responded by exceeding expectations – honor roll, swim team, first-chair violin – becoming the role model for her two younger brothers. Jackie had been looking forward to college as an escape – a place to, even, defy her parents' wishes and go to a frat party. ""And I guess they were right,"" she says bitterly.

She was having an especially difficult time figuring out how to process that awful night, because her small social circle seemed so underwhelmed. For the first month of school, Jackie had latched onto a crew of lighthearted social strivers, and her pals were now impatient for Jackie to rejoin the merriment. ""You're still upset about that?"" Andy asked one Friday night when Jackie was crying. Cindy, a self-declared hookup queen, said she didn't see why Jackie was so bent out of shape. ""Why didn't you have fun with it?"" Cindy asked. ""A bunch of hot Phi Psi guys?"" One of Jackie's friends told her, unconcerned, ""Andy said you had a bad experience at a frat, and you've been a baby ever since.""

That reaction of dismissal, downgrading and doubt is a common theme UVA rape survivors hear, including from women. ""Some of my hallmates were skeptical,"" recalls recent grad Emily Renda, who says that weeks into her first year she was raped after a party. ""They were silent and avoided me afterwards. It made me doubt myself."" Other students encounter more overt hostility, as when a first-year student confided her assault to a friend. ""She said she thought I was just looking for attention,"" says the undergrad. Shrugging off a rape or pointing fingers at the victim can be a self-protective maneuver for women, a form of wishful thinking to reassure themselves they could never be so vulnerable to violence. For men, skepticism is a form of self-protection too. For much of their lives, they've looked forward to the hedonistic fun of college, bearing every expectation of booze and no-strings sex. A rape heralds the uncomfortable idea that all that harmless mayhem may not be so harmless after all. Easier, then, to assume the girl is lying, even though studies indicate that false rape reports account for, at most, eight percent of reports.

And so at UVA, where social status is paramount, outing oneself as a rape victim can be a form of social suicide. ""I don't know many people who are engrossed in the party scene and have spoken out about their sexual assaults,"" says third-year student Sara Surface. After all, no one climbs the social ladder only to cast themselves back down. Emily Renda, for one, quickly figured out that few classmates were sympathetic to her plight, and instead channeled her despair into hard partying. ""My drinking didn't stand out,"" says Renda, who often ended her nights passed out on a bathroom floor. ""It does make you wonder how many others are doing what I did: drinking to self-medicate.""

By the middle of her first semester, Jackie's alarm would ring and ring in her dorm room until one of her five suitemates would pad down the hall to turn it off. Jackie would barely stir in her bed. ""That was when we realized she was even there,"" remembers suitemate Rachel Soltis. ""At the beginning of the year, she seemed like a normal, happy girl, always with friends. Then her door was closed all the time. We just figured she was out."" Long since abandoned by her original crew, Jackie had slept through half a semester's worth of classes and had bought a length of rope with which to hang herself. Instead, as the semester crawled to an end, she called her mother. ""Come and get me,"" Jackie told her, crying. ""I need your help.""

The first weeks of freshman year are when students are most vulnerable to sexual assault. Spend a Friday night in mid-September walking along Rugby Road at UVA, and you can begin to see why. Hundreds of women in crop tops and men in khaki shorts stagger between handsome fraternity houses, against a call-and-response soundtrack of ""Whoo!"" and breaking glass. ""Do you know where Delta Sig is?"" a girl slurs, sloshed. Behind her, one of her dozen or so friends stumbles into the street, sending a beer bottle shattering. (""Whoo!"" calls a far-away voice.)

""These are all first-years,"" narrates one of my small group of upperclasswomen guides. We walk the curving length of tree-lined Rugby Road as they explain the scene. The women rattle off which one is known as the ""roofie frat,"" where supposedly four girls have been drugged and raped, and at which house a friend had a recent ""bad experience,"" the Wahoo euphemism for sexual assault. Studies have shown that fraternity men are three times as likely to commit rape, and a spate of recent high-profile cases illustrates the dangers that can lurk at frat parties, like a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee frat accused of using color-coded hand stamps as a signal to roofie their guests, and this fall's suspension of Brown University's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi – of all fraternities – after a partygoer tested positive for the date-rape drug GHB. Presumably, the UVA freshmen wobbling around us are oblivious to any specific hazards along Rugby Road; having just arrived on campus, they can hardly tell one fraternity from another. As we pass another frat house, one of my guides offers, ""I know a girl who got assaulted there.""

""I do too!"" says her friend in mock-excitement. ""That makes two! Yay!""

Frats are often the sole option for an underage drinker looking to party, since bars are off-limits, sororities are dry and first-year students don't get many invites to apartment soirees. Instead, the kids crowd the walkways of the big, anonymous frat houses, vying for entry. ""Hot girls who are drunk always get in – it's a good idea to act drunker than you really are,"" says third-year Alexandria Pinkleton, expertly clad in the UVA-after-dark uniform of a midriff-baring sleeveless top and shorts. ""Also? You have to seem very innocent and vulnerable. That's why they love first-year girls.""

Once successfully inside the frat house, women play the role of grateful guests in unfamiliar territory where men control the variables. In dark, loud basements, girls accept drinks, are pulled onto dance floors to be ground and groped and, later, often having lost sight of their friends, led into bathrooms or up the stairs for privacy. Most of that hooking up is consensual. But against that backdrop, as psychologist David Lisak discovered, lurk undetected predators. Lisak's 2002 groundbreaking study of more than 1,800 college men found that roughly nine out of 10 rapes are committed by serial offenders, who are responsible for an astonishing average of six rapes each. None of the offenders in Lisak's study had ever been reported. Lisak's findings upended general presumptions about campus sexual assault: It implied that most incidents are not bumbling, he-said-she-said miscommunications, but rather deliberate crimes by serial sex offenders.

In his study, Lisak's subjects described the ways in which they used the camouflage of college as fruitful rape-hunting grounds. They told Lisak they target freshmen for being the most naïve and the least-experienced drinkers. One offender described how his party-hearty friends would help incapacitate his victims: ""We always had some kind of punch. . . . We'd make it with a real sweet juice. It was really powerful stuff. The girls wouldn't know what hit them."" Presumably, the friends mixing the drinks did so without realizing the offender's plot, just as when they probably high-fived him the next morning, they didn't realize the behavior they'd just endorsed. That's because the serial rapist's behavior can look ordinary at college. ""They're not acting in a vacuum,"" observes Lisak of predators. ""They're echoing that message and that culture that's around them: the objectification and degradation of women.""

One need only glance around at some recent college hijinks to see spectacular examples of the way the abasement of women has broken through to no-holds-barred misogyny: a Dartmouth student's how-to-rape guide posted online this past January; Yale pledges chanting ""No means yes! Yes means anal!"" And despite its air of mannered civility, UVA has been in on the naughty fun for at least 70 years with its jolly fight song ""Rugby Road,"" which celebrates the sexual triumphs of UVA fraternity men, named for the very same street where my guides and I are now enveloped in a thickening crowd of wasted first-years. Through the decades, the song has expanded to 35 verses, with the more recent, student-penned stanzas shedding the song's winking tone in favor of something more jarringly explicit:

>A hundred Delta Gammas, a thousand AZDs
Ten thousand Pi Phi bitches who get down on their knees
But the ones that we hold true, the ones that we hold dear
Are the ones who stay up late at night, and take it in the rear.

In 2010, ""Rugby Road"" was banned from football games – despite a petition calling it ""an integral part"" of UVA culture. But Wahoos fearing the loss of tradition can take heart that ""Rugby Road"" verses are still performed on campus by UVA's oldest a cappella group, the Virginia Gentlemen.

At the end of her freshman year, Jackie found herself in the Peabody Hall office of Dean Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. This was a big step for Jackie. She still hadn't even managed to tell her own mother exactly what had happened at Phi Kappa Psi. Upon returning to school for her second semester, Jackie had tried to put on a brave face and simply move forward, but instead continued falling apart. Though a psychiatrist had put Jackie on Wellbutrin, she had remained depressed, couldn't concentrate, and spent the semester so frightened and withdrawn that her academic dean finally called her in to discuss why she'd failed three classes. In his office, with her mother beside her, she'd burst into tears, and her mother explained she'd had a ""bad experience"" at a party. He'd blanched and given Jackie the e-mail for Dean Eramo.

If Dean Eramo was surprised at Jackie's story of gang rape, it didn't show. A short woman with curly dark hair and a no-nonsense demeanor, Eramo surely has among the most difficult jobs at UVA. As the intake person on behalf of the university for all sexual-assault complaints since 2006, it's her job to deal with a parade of sobbing students trekking in and out of her office. (UVA declined to make Eramo available for comment.) A UVA alum herself, Eramo is beloved by survivors, who consider her a friend and confidante – even though, as only a few students are aware, her office isn't a confidential space at all. Each time a new complaint comes through Eramo's office, it activates a review by UVA's Title IX officer, is included in UVA's tally of federally mandated Clery Act crime statistics, and Eramo may, at her discretion, reveal details of her conversation with the student to other administrators. (Jackie was mortified to learn later that Eramo had shared her identity with another UVA administrator.) After all, a dean's foremost priority is the overall safety of the campus.

When Jackie finished talking, Eramo comforted her, then calmly laid out her options. If Jackie wished, she could file a criminal complaint with police. Or, if Jackie preferred to keep the matter within the university, she had two choices. She could file a complaint with the school's Sexual Misconduct Board, to be decided in a ""formal resolution"" with a jury of students and faculty, and a dean as judge. Or Jackie could choose an ""informal resolution,"" in which Jackie could simply face her attackers in Eramo's presence and tell them how she felt; Eramo could then issue a directive to the men, such as suggesting counseling. Eramo presented each option to Jackie neutrally, giving each equal weight. She assured Jackie there was no pressure – whatever happened next was entirely her choice.

Like many schools, UVA has taken to emphasizing that in matters of sexual assault, it caters to victim choice. ""If students feel that we are forcing them into a criminal or disciplinary process that they don't want to be part of, frankly, we'd be concerned that we would get fewer reports,"" says associate VP for student affairs Susan Davis. Which in theory makes sense: Being forced into an unwanted choice is a sensitive point for the victims. But in practice, that utter lack of guidance can be counterproductive to a 19-year-old so traumatized as Jackie was that she was contemplating suicide. Setting aside for a moment the absurdity of a school offering to handle the investigation and adjudication of a felony sex crime – something Title IX requires, but which no university on Earth is equipped to do – the sheer menu of choices, paired with the reassurance that any choice is the right one, often has the end result of coddling the victim into doing nothing.

""This is an alarming trend that I'm seeing on campuses,"" says Laura Dunn of the advocacy group SurvJustice. ""Schools are assigning people to victims who are pretending, or even thinking, they're on the victim's side, when they're actually discouraging and silencing them. Advocates who survivors love are part of the system that is failing to address sexual violence.""

Absent much guidance, Jackie would eventually wonder how other student victims handled her situation. But when she clicked around on UVA's website, she found no answers. All she found were the UVA police's crime logs, which the university makes available online, but are mostly a list of bike theft, vandalism and public-drunkenness complaints. That's because only a fraction of UVA students who report sex crimes turn to campus police. The rest go to Dean Eramo's office, to Charlottesville police or the county sheriff's office. Yet when RS asked UVA for its statistics, the press office repeatedly referred us to the UVA police crime logs. UVA parent Susan Russell believes that misdirection is deliberate. ""When a parent goes to the campus crime log, and they don't see sexual assault, they think the school is safe,"" Russell says, adding that her daughter's 2004 sexual assault once appeared in the log mislabeled ""Suspicious Circumstances.""

Eventually, UVA furnished Rolling Stone with some of its most recent tally: In the last academic year, 38 students went to Eramo about a sexual assault, up from about 20 students three years ago. However, of those 38, only nine resulted in ""complaints""; the other 29 students evaporated. Of those nine complaints, four resulted in Sexual Misconduct Board hearings. UVA wasn't willing to disclose their outcomes, citing privacy. Like most colleges, sexual-assault proceedings at UVA unfold in total secrecy. Asked why UVA doesn't publish all its data, President Sullivan explains that it might not be in keeping with ""best practices"" and thus may inadvertently discourage reporting. Jackie got a different explanation when she'd eventually asked Dean Eramo the same question. She says Eramo answered wryly, ""Because nobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school.""

For now, however, Jackie left her first meeting with Eramo feeling better for having unburdened herself, and with the dean's assurance that nothing would be done without her say-so. Eramo e-mailed a follow-up note thanking Jackie for sharing, saying, ""I could tell that was very difficult for you,"" and restating that while she respected Jackie's wish not to file a report, she'd be happy to assist ""if you decide that you would like to hold these men accountable."" In the meantime, having presumably judged there to be no threat to public safety, the UVA administration took no action to warn the campus that an allegation of gang rape had been made against an active fraternity.

-""Rugby Road""

You can trace UVA's cycle of sexual violence and institutional indifference back at least 30 years – and incredibly, the trail leads back to Phi Psi. In October 1984, Liz Seccuro was a 17-year-old virgin when she went to a party at the frat and was handed a mixed drink. ""They called it the house special,"" she remembers. Things became spotty after Seccuro had a few sips. But etched in pain was a clear memory of a stranger raping her on a bed. She woke up wrapped in a bloody sheet; by rifling through the boy's mail before fleeing, she discovered his name was Will Beebe. Incredibly, 21 years later, Beebe wrote Seccuro a letter, saying he wanted to make amends as part of his 12-step program. Seccuro took the correspondence to Charlottesville police. And in the midst of the 2006 prosecution that followed, where Beebe would eventually plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery, investigators made a startling discovery: That while at Phi Psi that night, Seccuro had been assaulted not by one man, but by three. ""I had been gang-raped,"" says Seccuro, who detailed her ordeal in a 2011 memoir.

That it took two decades for Seccuro to achieve some justice is even more disgraceful, since she reported her rape to the UVA administration after leaving the Phi Psi house on that 1984 morning. ""I went to the dean covered in scabs and with broken ribs,"" she remembers. ""And he said, 'Do you think it was just regrettable sex?' "" Seccuro wanted to call police, but she was incorrectly told Charlottesville police lacked jurisdiction over fraternity houses.

If Seccuro's story of administrative cover-up and apathy sounds outrageous, it's actually in keeping with the stories told by other UVA survivors. After one alumna was abducted from a dark, wooded section of campus and raped in 1993, she says she asked a UVA administrator for better lighting. ""They told me it would ruin Jefferson's vision of what the university was supposed to look like,"" the alum says. ""As if Thomas Jefferson even knew about electric lights!"" In 2002 and 2004, two female students, including Susan Russell's daughter, were unhappy with their sexual-misconduct hearings, which each felt didn't hold their alleged perpetrators accountable – and each was admonished by UVA administrators to never speak publicly about the proceedings or else they could face expulsion for violating the honor code. For issuing that directive, in 2008 UVA was found in violation of the Clery Act.

""UVA is more egregious than most,"" says John Foubert, a UVA dean from 1998 to 2002, and founder of the national male sex-assault peer education group One in Four. ""I've worked for five or six colleges, and the stuff I saw happen during my time there definitely stands out."" For example, Foubert recalls, in one rare case in which the university applied a harsh penalty, an undergrad was suspended after stalking five students. Heated discussion ensued over whether the boy should be allowed back after his suspension. Though the counseling center wanted him to stay gone, Foubert says, the then-dean of students argued in favor of his return, saying, ""We can pick our lawsuit from a potential sixth victim, or from him, for denying him access to an education.""

The few stories leaking out of UVA's present-day justice system aren't much better. One student, whose Title IX complaint against UVA is currently under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights, said that in December 2011, another student raped her while she was blackout drunk, possibly drugged. As she wrote in a student publication, evidence emerged that the man had previously been accused of drugging others, but the information was rejected as ""prejudicial."" The Sexual Misconduct Board told the young woman it found her ""compelling and believable,"" but found the man not guilty. ""I had never felt so betrayed and let down in my life,"" wrote the woman. ""They said that they believed me. They said that UVA was my home and that it loved me. Yet, how could they believe me and let him go completely unpunished?""

Rolling Stone has discovered that this past spring a UVA first-year student, whom we'll call Stacy, filed a report stating that while vomiting up too much whiskey into a male friend's toilet one night, he groped her, plunged his hands down her sweatpants and then, after carrying her semi-conscious to his bed, digitally penetrated her. When the Charlottesville DA's office declined to file charges, she says, Stacy asked for a hearing with the Sexual Misconduct Board, and was surprised when UVA authority figures tried to talk her out of it. ""My counselors, members of the Dean of Students office, everyone said the trial process would be way too hard on me,"" says Stacy. ""They were like, 'You need to focus on your healing.' "" Stacy insisted upon moving forward anyway, even when the wealthy family of the accused kicked up a fuss. ""They threatened to sue deans individually, they threatened to sue me,"" she recalls. But Stacy remained stalwart, because she had additional motivation: She'd been shaken to discover two other women with stories of assault by the same man. ""One was days after mine, at a rush function at his frat house,"" says Stacy. ""So I was like, 'I have to do something before someone else is hurt.' "" Her determination redoubled after the Dean of Students office informed her that multiple assaults by a student would be grounds for his expulsion – a mantra that Eramo repeated at a Take Back the Night event in April.

Bearing her deans' words in mind, at her nine-hour formal hearing in June, Stacy took pains to present not only her own case, but also the other two allegations, submitting witness statements that were allowed in as ""pattern evidence."" The board pronounced the man guilty for sexual misconduct against Stacy, making him only the 14th guilty person in UVA's history. Stacy was relieved at the verdict. ""I was like, 'He's gone!' 'Cause he's a multiple assailant, I'd been told so many times that that was grounds for expulsion!"" So she was stunned when she learned his actual penalty: a one-year suspension. (Citing privacy laws, UVA would not comment on this or any case.)

Turns out, when UVA personnel speak of expulsion for ""multiple assaults,"" they mean multiple complaints that are filed with the Sexual Misconduct Board, and then adjudicated guilty. Under that more precise definition, the two other cases introduced in Stacy's case didn't count toward his penalty. Stacy feels offended by the outcome and misled by the deans. ""After two rapes and an assault, to let him back on grounds is an insult to the honor system that UVA brags about,"" she says. ""UVA doesn't want to expel. They were too afraid of getting negative publicity or the pants sued
off them.""

When did it happen to you?"" Emily Renda asked Jackie as they sat for coffee at the outdoor Downtown Mall in the fall of 2013.

""September 28th,"" Jackie whispered.

""October 7th, 2010,"" Emily responded, not breaking her gaze, and Jackie knew she'd found a friend. As Jackie had begun her second year at UVA, she'd continued struggling. Dean Eramo had connected her with Emily, a fourth-year who'd become active in One Less, a student-run sexual-assault education organization that doubles as a support group. Sitting with Emily, Jackie poured out her story, wiping her eyes with napkins as she confided to Emily that she felt like a broken person. ""You're not broken,"" Emily told her. ""They're the ones who are fucked up, and what happened to you wasn't your fault."" Jackie was flooded with gratitude, desperate to hear those words at last – and from someone who knew. Emily invited her to a meeting of One Less, thus introducing her to UVA's true secret society.

In its weekly meetings, the 45-member group would discuss how to foster dialogue on campus. Afterward they'd splinter off and share stories of sexual assault, each tale different and yet very much the same. Many took place on tipsy nights with men who refused to stop; some were of sex while blackout drunk; rarer stories involved violence, though none so extreme as Jackie's. But no matter the circumstances, their peers' reactions were largely the same: Assaults were brushed off, with attackers defended (""He'd never do anything like that""), the victim questioned (""Are you sure?""). After feeling isolated for more than a year, Jackie was astonished at how much she and this sisterhood had in common, including the fact that a surprising number hadn't pursued any form of complaint. Although many had contacted Dean Eramo, whom they laud as their best advocate and den mother – Jackie repeatedly calls her ""an asset to the community"" – few ever filed reports with UVA or with police. Instead, basking in the safety of one another's company, the members of One Less applauded the brave few who chose to take action, but mostly affirmed each other's choices not to report, in an echo of their university's approach. So profound was the students' faith in its administration that although they were appalled by Jackie's story, no one voiced questions about UVA's strategy of doing nothing to warn the campus of gang-rape allegations against a fraternity that still held parties and was rushing a new pledge class.

Some of these women are disturbed by the contradiction. ""It's easy to cover up a rape at a university if no one is reporting,"" admits Jackie's friend Alex Pinkleton. And privately, some of Jackie's confidantes were outraged. ""The university ignores the problem to make itself look better,"" says recent grad Rachel Soltis, Jackie's former roommate. ""They should have done something in Jackie's case. Me and several other people know exactly who did this to her. But they want to protect even the people who are doing these horrible things.""

But no such doubts shadowed the meetings of One Less, which was fine by Jackie. One Less held seminars for student groups on bystander intervention and how to be supportive of survivors. Jackie dove into her new roles as peer adviser and Take Back the Night committee member and began to discover just how wide her secret UVA survivor network was – because the more she shared her story, the more girls sought her out, waylaying her after presentations or after classes, even calling in the middle of the night with a crisis. Jackie has been approached by so many survivors that she wonders whether the one-in-five statistic may not apply in Charlottesville. ""I feel like it's one in three at UVA,"" she says.

But payback for being so public on a campus accustomed to silence was swift. This past spring, in separate incidents, both Emily Renda and Jackie were harassed outside bars on the Corner by men who recognized them from presentations and called them ""cunt"" and ""feminazi bitch."" One flung a bottle at Jackie that broke on the side of her face, leaving a blood-red bruise around her eye.

She e-mailed Eramo so they could discuss the attack – and discuss another matter, too, which was troubling Jackie a great deal. Through her ever expanding network, Jackie had come across something deeply disturbing: two other young women who, she says, confided that they, too, had recently been Phi Kappa Psi gang-rape victims.

A bruise still mottling her face, Jackie sat in Eramo's office in May 2014 and told her about the two others. One, she says, is a 2013 graduate, who'd told Jackie that she'd been gang-raped as a freshman at the Phi Psi house. The other was a first-year whose worried friends had called Jackie after the girl had come home wearing no pants. Jackie said the girl told her she'd been assaulted by four men in a Phi Psi bathroom while a fifth watched. (Neither woman was willing to talk to RS.)

As Jackie wrapped up her story, she was disappointed by Eramo's nonreaction. She'd expected shock, disgust, horror. For months, Jackie had been assuaging her despair by throwing herself into peer education, but there was no denying her helplessness when she thought about Phi Psi, or about her own alleged assailants still walking the grounds. She'd recently been aghast to bump into Drew, who greeted her with friendly nonchalance. ""For a whole year, I thought about how he had ruined my life, and how he is the worst human being ever,"" Jackie says. ""And then I saw him and I couldn't say anything.""

""You look different,"" Drew told Jackie while she stared back at him in fear, and he was right: Since arriving at UVA, Jackie had gained 25 pounds from antidepressants and lack of exercise. That interaction would render her too depressed to leave her room for days. Of all her assailants, Drew was the one she wanted to see held accountable – but with Drew about to graduate, he was going to get away with it. Because, as she miserably reminded Eramo in her office, she didn't feel ready to file a complaint. Eramo, as always, understood.

Given the swirl of gang-rape allegations Eramo had now heard against one of UVA's oldest and most powerful fraternities – founded in 1853, its distinguished chapter members have included President Woodrow Wilson – the school may have wondered about its responsibilities to the rest of the campus. Experts apprised of the situation by RS agreed that despite the absence of an official report, Jackie's passing along two other allegations should compel the school to take action out of regard for campus safety. ""The fact that they already had that first victim, they should have been taking action,"" says SurvJustice's Laura Dunn. ""That school could really be sued.""

If the UVA administration was roiled by such concerns, however, it wasn't apparent this past September, as it hosted a trustees meeting. Two full hours had been set aside to discuss campus sexual assault, an amount of time that, as many around the conference table pointed out, underscored the depth of UVA's commitment. Those two hours, however, were devoted entirely to upbeat explanations of UVA's new prevention and response strategies, and to self-congratulations to UVA for being a ""model"" among schools in this arena. Only once did the room darken with concern, when a trustee in UVA colors – blue sport coat, orange bow tie – interrupted to ask, ""Are we under any federal investigation with regard to sexual assault?""

Dean of students Allen Groves, in a blue suit and orange necktie of his own, swooped in with a smooth answer. He affirmed that while like many of its peers UVA was under investigation, it was merely a ""standard compliance review."" He mentioned that a student's complaint from the 2010-11 academic year had been folded into that ""routine compliance review."" Having downplayed the significance of a Title IX compliance review – which is neither routine nor standard – he then elaborated upon the lengths to which UVA has cooperated with the Office of Civil Rights' investigation, his tone and manner so reassuring that the room relaxed.

Told of the meeting, Office of Civil Rights' Catherine Lhamon calls Groves' mischaracterization ""deliberate and irresponsible."" ""Nothing annoys me more than a school not taking seriously their review from the federal government about their civil rights obligations,"" she says.

Within days of the board meeting, having learned of Rolling Stone's probe into Jackie's story, UVA at last placed Phi Kappa Psi under investigation. Or rather, as President Sullivan carefully answered my question about allegations of gang rape at Phi Psi, ""We do have a fraternity under investigation."" Phi Kappa Psi national executive director Shawn Collinsworth says that UVA indeed notified him of sexual assault allegations; he immediately dispatched a representative to meet with the chapter. UVA chapter president Stephen Scipione recalls being only told of a vague, anonymous ""fourth-hand"" allegation of a sexual assault during a party. ""We were not told that it was rape, but rather that something of a sexual nature took place,"" he wrote to RS in an e-mail. Either way, Collinsworth says, given the paucity of information, ""we have no evidence to substantiate the alleged assaults.""

""Under investigation,"" President Sullivan insists when I ask her to elaborate on how the university is handling the case. ""I don't know how else to spell that out for you."" But Jackie may have gotten a glimpse into the extent of the investigation when, in the days following my visit to campus, she was called into Eramo's office, bringing along her friend Alex for moral support. According to both women, Eramo revealed that she'd learned ""through the grapevine"" that ""all the boys involved have graduated."" Both girls were mystified. Not only had Jackie just seen one of the boys riding his bike on grounds but, as Alex pointed out, ""Doesn't that mean they're admitting something happened?"" No warning has yet been issued to the campus.

With a pocketknife and pepper spray tucked into her handbag, and a rape whistle hanging from her key chain, Jackie is prepared for a Friday night at UVA. In a restaurant on the Corner, Jackie sips water through a straw as the first of the night's ""Whoo!""s reverberate from the sidewalk outside. ""It makes me really depressed, almost,"" says Jackie with a sad chuckle. ""There's always gonna be another Friday night, and another fraternity party, and another girl.""

Across the table, Alex sighs. ""I know,"" she says. Bartenders and bouncers all along the Corner are wearing T-shirts advertising the new ""Hoos Got Your Back"" bystander-intervention campaign, which all seems very hopeful. But this week, the third week of September, has been a difficult one. Charlottesville police received their first sexual-assault report of the academic year; Jackie and Alex were also each approached by someone seeking help about an assault. And as this weekend progresses, things will get far worse at UVA: Two more sexual assaults will be reported to police, and, in every parent's worst fears come true, an 18-year-old student on her way to a party will vanish; her body will be discovered five weeks later.

Suspect Jesse Matthew Jr., a 32-year-old UVA hospital worker, will be charged with Hannah Graham's ""abduction with intent to defile,"" and a chilling portrait will emerge of an alleged predator who got his start, a decade ago, as a campus rapist. Back in 2002, and again in 2003, Matthew was accused of sexual assault at two different Virginia colleges where he was enrolled, but was never prosecuted. In 2005, according to the new police indictment, Matthew sexually assaulted a 26-year-old and tried to kill her. DNA has also reportedly linked Matthew to the 2009 death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared after a Metallica concert in Charlottesville. The grisly dossier of which Matthew has been accused underscores the premise that campus rape should be seen not through the schema of a dubious party foul, but as a violent crime – and that victims should be encouraged to come forward as an act of civic good that could potentially spare future victims.

Jackie is hoping she will get there someday. She badly wants to muster the courage to file criminal charges or even a civil case. But she's paralyzed. ""It's like I'm in my own personal prison,"" she says. ""I'm so terrified this is going to be the rest of my life."" She still cries a lot, and she has been more frightened than usual to be alone or to walk in the dark. When Jackie talks about her assault, she fixates on the moment before Drew picked her up for their date: ""I remember looking at the mirror and putting on mascara and being like, 'I feel really pretty,' "" Jackie recalls. ""I didn't know it would be the last time I wouldn't see an empty shell of a person.""

Jackie tells me of a recurring nightmare she's been having, in which she's watching herself climb those Phi Kappa Psi stairs. She frantically calls to herself to stop, but knows it's too late: That in real life, she's already gone up those stairs and into that terrible room, and things will never be the same. It bothers Jackie to know that Drew and the rest get to walk away as if nothing happened, but that she still walks toward that room every night – and blames herself for it during the day.

I was raised an only child
My folks died when I was four

I've lost everything I've ever, ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh, baby

So, all my love I gave to Jeff
'Cause he was all I had right then
But the wheels of an automobile
Brought his life to a tragic end

From an orphan home to college
Thought I found true love in you
I felt sure we would marry
But your folks did not approve

Now I'm losing you, oh
I've lost everything I've ever loved, baby
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh, baby

You accepted their decision
Without any type of defense
They said if we wait a few more years
That would make a little more sense

So we waited three or four
Everyday we kept in touch
But when we came face to face
You didn't love me quite as much

Oh, baby

Nothing works out right for me

I've lost everything I've ever loved

Question 10:
David_J_Huggins: ""Hi Noel
Do you remember where the chant in the demo of Columbia was sampled from?
Sounds like a Hare Krishna-type chant to me, but would love to know where it was actually from. Thanks!""

NG: ""None of us know. It was just - we switched on the radio - it was recorded in the middle of the night, about 3 or 4 AM, and we just... it was something that was on the BBC World Service I think or some fucking radio station. None of us know what it is. No idea.""

Question 11:
Pottersground: ""Hi Noel, fan since the Definitely Maybe days here. Thanks for doing this AMA. My three questions are:
1) If there had been one more Oasis album after Dig Out Your Soul, what do you think it would've been like? Which songs of yours or the other three would you have put on it?
2) What's your maddest Oasis story?
3) What lead to Lock All the Doors being dug up and rerecorded for Chasing Yesterday? And,while we're on the subject, are there any odds in any other old and unreleased songs being redone for future releases? I would love to hear a finished version of Gotta Have Fun from the '89 tape
Cheers Noel!""

NG: ""1.) Okay. It would've been half of my first solo record, so ""Record Machine"" would've probably been on it... ""Stop the Clocks"" would've probably been on it, and ""Dream On"" and maybe ""Stranded on the Wrong Beach"" and then the rest of the guys would've put on some of their own songs
2.) Hah. Wow. Maddest Oasis story. Just the fact that we existed AT ALL and became the biggest band in the world is bizarre enough. I'm not going to share any Oasis stories with anybody online for fear of litigation and libel
Although needless to say - there were oiled midgets involved. grins
There, I've said too much
3.) ""Gotta Have Fun?"" What led to ""Lock All the Doors"" being resurrected was just the fact that I kept the chorus in my head all those years... and I just happened to be comin' out of the local supermarket, on a Sunday evening... and snaps fingers it fell out of the sky
That's it
There are no more hidden gems to be regurgitated
Good word. Regurgitated
""Gotta Have Fun?"" Don't remember that one.""

Question 12:
Ruben122: ""Hi Noel. Huge fan from Montevideo, Uruguay here. Any plans on coming to South America? Thank you!""

NG: ""Yes. I believe... it's pencilled in... although don't quote me on this... for March 2016.""

Question 13:
FootballDropout: ""Wow... I can't believe you're finally doing an AMA!
I've been a huge fan of your work for years, and Live Forever is my all-time favorite song. I love the new album, and I can't describe how happy I am that you finished Lock all the Doors. Your music, especially the Masterplan album and your first solo album has been the amazing soundtrack to my teenage years and helped me through some really rough times
Do you have any plans to release songs such as ""Bye Bye My Family/Don't Stop Being Happy,"" ""She Must Be One of Us"" or ""Just Let it Come Down Over Me""?
The Mustique Demos are something of a ""Holy Grail"" among Oasis fans. Will they be released with the Be Here Now reissue?
To get a response from you would be incredible, and again thank you for all the incredible music.""

NG: ""Okay
There will be a ""Be Here Now"" reissue
The Mustique Demos will be on it
Indeed
The 3 songs that you mentioned - ""Bye Bye My Family"" is called ""Don't Stop..."" - the other two will definitely be released at some point - not sure when.""

Question 14:
Thefatronaldo: ""Should City sack Pellegrini this summer and if so who would you like to see in charge next?""

Question 16:
Laurakd7: ""Do you get up to Manchester much these days and do you prefer London now?""

NG: ""Eh - I go to Manchester to see my football team, Manchester City. When I go there, I love it. I usually spend about 2 or 3 nights there, at a time, and it's great, but London has become my home. And it's where I will probably stay from now on.""

Question 17:
Danniboi1Derz: ""What's your favorite thing to eat in the states?""

DannyBoi1Derz: ""I know your son Donovan and you are pretty big WWE fans. Who's your favorite Wrassler??""

NG: ""nods
At the moment - Donovan's favourite wrestler is Brock Lesner. Because he's mean, and evil
My favourite wrestler at the moment is Bray Wyatt. Because we met him when they did a show in London, and he was a really fucking nice guy. And we met Hulk Hogan, and he was a REALLY fucking nice guy. He asked if I was one of his Hulkamaniacs, and I had to say ""yes, of course!"" He came into this room, and I was going ""Look Donovan, it's Hulk Hogan"" and he goes ""Look BROTHER, are you one of my Hulkamaniacs?!"" and I said ""Yes, of course!""

NG: ""gestures with ring

I bought this ring in a pawn shop in Tokyo in the 90's. It's a US college ring that I believe people get when they graduate from college in America. It was given to somebody. I'm assuming a G.I. stationed in Tokyo, from Ruston High School in Mississippi (I've looked it up)
It has started many a boring conversation with some of the American armed forces in airport lounges across the world, when they'll say to me ""Where'd you go to school buddy?""
""Manchester?""

""I went to Ruston High School in Mississippi, as you can tell by my accent.""""

JamJam21: ""Hi Noel! will you be adding anymore dates in the uk to your tour?""

NG: ""I think there will be more dates, but not 'til 2016.""

Question 29:
LordSifter: ""You're still great mates with Gem - what's next for him? Will we see the 2 of you play together in the near future?""

NG: ""I was with Gem about 4 weeks ago. Didn't get a chance to talk about anything really. It was at a party I was having in my dressing room, and there were too many people there. But if I needed on a track or a gig that thing that Gem offers, then I wouldn't hesitate to call him because I'd still like to think we're good friends and musical partners
As for what he's going to do in the future... I have no idea.""

Question 30:
PraetorianGuard14: ""Have you seen the new documentary on Kurt Cobain?""

NG: ""No.""

Question 31:
Jamesh134: ""Hi Noel, what ever happened to the Oasis version of ""The Roller""?
Also, I wanted to say thanks for all the music over the years. Been a source of inspiration all my life!""

NG: ""Oh, thank you very much
The Oasis version of ""The Roller"" is... in somebody's... demo CD collection CD, somewhere. Not mine, I might add
Somebody will have it. Gem will probably have a copy of it. As has Liam, no doubt.""

Question 32:
Sterlingavenueband: ""Hi Noel. First of all- thank you for the many years of great music and leading me to my first guitar 18 years ago. Forever indebted to you for this
What are your thoughts on the songs 'Let's All Make Believe' and 'Roll It Over' and what are the chances of ever hearing them live? They're amongst two of my favourites of many which have never been done live before. Thanks in advance.""

NG: ""Eh - ""Roll It Over"" probably will never be performed live. But on the other hand, ""Let's All Make Believe"" I was messing around with it before this tour started, so I wouldn't be surprised if I play it in the very far distant future.""

Question 33:
ZeppelinYanks: ""Hey Noel! I'm a huge fan of Oasis and your solo work
A lot of what made Oasis great was the rock and roll attitude of ""Fuck you, we're the greatest band in the world."" What do you think about the current state of rock and roll? Is it alive, dead, or dying?""

NG: ""ponders
I think that rock n' roll has turned into - or been turned into - a thing that is now referred to as ""modern rock."" Which is an awful title to give any kind of music. I think - I just think that the attitude, and the spirit, that we had is definitely disappearing.""

Question 34:
Rodoalo: ""Hi Noel, it's Rod from URUGUAY
My question has always been this:
Do you have any knowledge of music theory or did you learn songwriting by ear?
Cheers, your new record is amazing.""

NG: ""I learnt song-writin' by ear and instinct. I've never studied musical theory. I would never allow myself or any of my children to study musical theory. Because if you study musical theory, you will eventually end up soundin' like...shit
Hahaha.""

Question 35:
Riceomatic69: ""You have always spoken very highly of Ryan Adams & his version of Wonderwall, have you ever encountered anybody else that covered one of your tracks & thought it was as good as your version or maybe even better?""

NG: ""No.""

Question 36:
Look_who_it_isnt: ""Hi Noel! I'm a huge fan. Your music has brought me so much enjoyment over the years - I can't even put it into words. I have major respect and love for you and wish you all the happiness in the world! I have two questions for you:
1) I love your sense of humor. You always make me laugh :) What's your favorite comedy, either from TV or movies?
2) A lot of us ladies think you're just the hottest thing ever. Does it bother you to be considered a veritable sex god? ;)""

NG: ""1.) SEINFELD. The greatest thing that's ever been on television
2.) It's a cross I have to bear. And unfortunately... you know, it's a long road that I will have to carry this cross down. But I could think of worse things to be. I.E... a French person in Montreal.""

Question 37:
Loulou96: ""Hi Noel
I heard on radio 1 you perform shows wearing no underwear, can you confirm?""

NG: ""Yeah, well, clearly that was a joke.""

Question 38:
Super2goten: ""Hey! Whose names were written on that napkin, Noel?
Thanks for being a legend! Think The Dying Of The Light/The Right Stuff/While The Song Remains The Same may be your best work yet, so thanks for that too! CTID!""

NG: ""The names on the napkin was yours and your family's.""
NG: ""And I agree with those songs being my best work, and I admire your taste.""

Question 39:
GiovaniGuizzo: ""Hello Mr. Gallagher. Thanks for doing this AmA. I am a huge Oasis's and NGHFB's fan and I actually have several questions, but I will contain myself and ask just 3:
Which music is this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mYMKfuUYc ? It sounds pretty amazing. Would you consider recording it eventually? Can you give us the name of this tune at least?
Have you met the girl of ""Talk Tonight"" after you wrote the song? If you have, how was the meeting?
I loved your new album, specially the ""Lock All the Doors"" track (what a blast from the past). Can we expect other reworked songs from the past in your future albums?
PS: You would like to take a look at /r/oasis. There are some interesting and insightful posts there from some mad fans.""

NG: ""1.) That song is called ""Don't stop..."" I've already recorded it. The reason it didn't make it onto ""Chasing Yesterday"" was because it didn't fit the vibe of the album. Needless to say, when I finally get 'round to releasing it, I think it will be one of my best ever releases. The sound of it is more akin to the first album, and I felt like ""Chasing Yesterday"" had moved on a little bit. But it's a great song, and I love it, and when I finally release it, you're going to love it (fans, that is)
2.) Eh - no, I haven't. I struggle to remember her name, to be honest
3.) No. That's it now, I'm afraid. The cupboards are bare.""

Question 40:
Rak86t: ""You're a great story teller and have such a way with words. Would you ever consider writing a book?""

NG: ""looks around room
No.""

Question 41:
Supersonic5: ""Hey Chief! Never in a million years thought I’d see you do an AMA
You mentioned that you regret the name ‘Chasing Yesterday’, would you change it if you could, and what would you change it to?""

NG: """"Regret"" is too strong a word. I don't think it's the greatest title I ever came up with. But then again, neither was ""What's the Story, Morning Glory."" If I could change it now, I'd probably change it to... eh... ""Dark Side of the Room""
OR ""Wheat is Murder."" Hahahaha!""

Question 42:
Chenredditdude: ""Hey Noel, I've noticed that in many songs you play E MINOR... Is it a heavenly chord?""

NG: ""Hmmm
I guess it must be.""

Question 43:
Govt_cheeze: ""Hello Noel
How does it feel to be one of the last true rockstars?
&
What do you think of the new Blur album?""

NG: ""It feels good to be one of the last rockstars
If in fact, that's what I am
And from what I've heard of the new Blur album, it sounds pretty good.""

Question 44:
Rpm959: ""What do you think it will take for guitar music to make a comeback?""

NG: ""Somebody to write some fucking great songs
That's all it'll ever take
That's all it takes. People can talk about ""attitude,"" and ""spirit"" and fucking good-looking guys in bands, and vibe, and fucking blah-blah-blah. I dare ANYBODY from the next generation to write one decent chorus
Yeah
Just one.""

Question 45:
Justsomepersononredd: ""Hi Noel, huge fan of most of your work
1) Do you ever get tired of people asking you all kinds of questions about Oasis? I've watched a few interviews with you post-Oasis and pretty much everyone's asked you a question or two about Oasis, I suppose I'm really not being different but do you ever feel like people should just move on?
2) How has touring and your creative process changed over the years? I mean, the music you put out now is quite different from the start of your career and I'm guessing there isn't as much partying behind the scenes as when you started
3) Which modern-day bands do you listen to nowadays? I discovered Kasabian by watching an interview of you and I think they're amazing, so thanks for that too
4) Any musicians you'd like to collaborate with?
5) I read that you had another brother, Paul, but I've never actually heard anything about him. What's he like?
6) What do you think of all these new forms of music distribution? Itunes, Spotify, Tidal, etc
Thanks for your time, hope you enjoy your AMA, and keep being an awesome musician""

NG: ""1.) Yes. I do feel like they should move on. But I don't mind answerin' the questions if they're from fans, because i know how much that band meant, and continues to mean to people. So in my head, and my heart, I've moved on. So it's cool
2.) There's certainly not as much partying in front of the scenes, that's for sure. Everything changes as you get older in life. You know, you don't attempt as much as you did when you're 47 as you did when you were 27 - whether that be length of time on the road, or partying, or amount of songs that you write, or the places you're willing to go to write those songs. The life of a musician in regards to gettin' older is just the same as everybody else's life as they get older. Your fucking shit changes. Not literally
3.) Eh - yes, Kasabian would be one of my favourites. There's a band called Neon Waltz that you should check out. I'm not sure... there's a band called Jungle. Fucking hell, they are amazin'. Other than that, I'm still discovering old stuff from the 60's, I'm afraid
4.) Dave Gillmore, Jeff Beck, Davie Bowie would be - fucking hell, that would blow my mind if he would even shake a maraca for one tune, that'd be great. Yeah
5.) Heh. He's a fucking idiot - I'm only jokin' - haha! He's a dj. He - when I'm on tour in the UK - he does my official after show parties. And he's a funny, funny dude
6.) I don't agree with streamin'. I certainly don't agree with the lack of royalties that I receive from streamin'. I realize that the world is changin', and the way that people receive music - and even the fact that I use the phrase ""receive music"" is a fucking disgrace. I would rather that people own it. But I'm not sure where it's all going to end, if I'm being honest
I'll try.""

Question 46:
Pheelip: ""Hey Noel, huge fan. What do you think has been your greatest musical achievement?""

NG: ""Whooooooo
I couldn't say with any great sense of certainty, because it changes every day for me, but I'm going to say the song ""Rock & Roll Star"" because it sums up everything about bein' young, and bein' in a band, and the hopes and dreams of, you know, a young land from Manchester
And it's a fucking great song.""

Question 47:
MadferitNYC: ""Do you think a rock band in 2015 can reach the level of popularity that Oasis reached? Or do you think that the music industry is too dead for there ever to be a rock band that reaches those heights again?""

NG: ""I think that the days of a rock band explodin' out of a council estate in the north of England and going on to connect with so many people in so many countries around the world... I think the chances of that happenin' again are very, very slim
But we live in hope.""

Question 48:
Karmarghh: ""Hey Noel, been a huge fan of yours almost all 20 years of my life. I have been lucky enough to see NGHFB twice recently and just want to tell you the new album is f***ing incredible! You, among the likes of Bacharach and Macca, are my absolute inspiration for pursuing a life in Music, so thanks for that. Anyway - couple questions for you:

1) As a songwriter, could you let me in on your approach to melody? I listen to yours and ask myself ""why the bloody hell didn't I think of that?!"". Do they really just pop into your head or do you find there is a lot of trial and error?

2) Reckon you can give me a kick-start and replace Mike Rowe with me on keys? He's a cool guy, but I'll do it for nothing. That gives me the edge right? Oh and I won't f*ck it up - I promise!!

Take it easy Noel, and keep doing what you're doing. Riverman blows my mind.""

NG: ""1.) Eh - it depends. The great ones usually just pop into your head. And seem to just fall out of the sky. And then some of them you have to work at. There is no golden rule or any rule set in stone for songwritin'. No matter what anybody might tell you, it seems to change from song to song for me. But I guess... I always, always, ALWAYS let the melody dictate the rest. I don't worry about the chords. I just let the melody dictate where the song's going to go and sometimes they're great and sometimes they're not
2.) Well, you're in! Cheap labor is my forte, haha.""

Question 49:
Sally_cinnamon_: ""Hi Noel! First of all, thanks for giving us so much great music. You truly are a godlike genius
My question for you is: where did your sense of humor and talent for storytelling come from? Because I think you are genuinely one of the funniest people in the world seemingly without even trying
Also, do you still think dogs in hats and sunglasses are hilarious?""

NG: ""Well - dogs in hats and sunglasses - there is *NOTHING* funnier than a dog in a hat
Ehm - I don't know. My sense of humor, I don't know. It's Irish, it must've been passed down to me from somebody in Ireland.""

Question 50:
Jeavo: ""Hi Noel, thanks for doing this AMA
If at all any, what video games do you play?""

NG: ""I don't play video games
I have a life. And that life is too short for video games
Some of my band play video games on tour. It drives me up the fucking wall. And it's one of the main reasons why I'll probably fire the fucking lot of them on this tour.""

Question 51:
Shivan21: ""Hi Noel! I've always wondered about the meaning of D'you know what I mean video, and especially the fact that there is Be Here Now and D'you know what I mean written in czech language. The video has very 60's atmosphere for me and they are also alluded by Beatles references. Considering the military choppers, could be the video understood as refering to the Prague Spring in 1968?""

NG: ""No. Okay. The video for ""D'You know what I mean"" was shot on the deserted set of FULL METAL JACKET, which is still - you can still visit it in London - so it's an old, disused gasworks in London. The Czech writing, I'm not sure what that's all about, I thought it was Vietnamese writin'. The choppers was a reference to Vietnam. What any of that has to do with the fucking song is beyond me. I don't even know what the song's about, never mind the video!""

Question 52:
Brutalful: ""Hi Noel
I am curious what (if anything) is still on your bucket list?
If you have done it all, what are your top 5 moments in life, and is playing with Johnny Marr on that list?
Cheers!""

NG: ""Okay. First of all - a bucket list is the most fucking ludicrous fucking term I've ever heard, in my life
BUT
I would like someday to record an album in New York. I would also like to have Dave Gilmore play on a track for me. And Jeff Beck. I think that's about it
Oh, actually, I also still think that one day I'm going to write the greatest song in the world.""

Question 53:
Nathanoasis: ""Hello Noel! Your music is incredible, all 20 years of it, and it has changed my life. Thank you for that and thank you for doing this AMA. I have a question about the song that is going around the Internet under the name ""Bye Bye My Family"" (and ""Don't Stop the Happenin'"" and ""Hold Back the Night""). From what we've heard, the song sounds amazing. Will this song ever be recorded and released? Thank you again and keep on being an absolute fucking legend!""

NG: ""chuckles
I pretty much just answered that question about 20 minutes ago. It's a song called ""Don't Stop...""
I've already recorded it. It didn't make it onto ""Chasing Yesterday"" because it sounded a bit too much like what was already on the first High Flying Birds album
But it will be released, in, you know... soon!""

Question 54:
MidnightPizza: ""Hello Mr. Gallagher! I'd like to thank you for all the music you wrote. I hope to see one of your show soon and maybe pay you a beer. Here are my questions:
1) Are you still thinking about doing an album with Damon Albarn? What do you think about The Magic Whip, Blur's latest album?
2) What's your opinion about Dave Sardy's input on your work? Some people think that your latest work (especially your first solo album) could've been better without him and that producing Chasing Yesterday yourself was refreshing. I personally enjoy the Dave Sardy produced albums as much as any other album you wrote
Anyway, congratulation on Chasing Yesterday. It really is a great album.""

NG: ""1.) Ehm - the thing with Damon was a flippant comment as casually thrown around as ""We should go for a drink."" As for makin' an album, I would be amazed if either of us ever had the time to make that work. As for ""The Magic Whip,"" I like the tracks ""Lonesome Street"" and ""Ong Ong"" - I haven't heard any of the rest of it, but if those two tracks are anything to go by, sounds like it's going to be good
2.) Ehm - his input was fantastic. And at the time, invaluable. And I couldn't have got my solo career off the ground without him. All that being said - you know, my record, this record, ""Chasing Yesterday,"" sounds that good. With any producer, it's all about the relationship, as opposed to the skills that they can bring. But me and Dave, you know, still to this day we remain good friends, and maybe we'll work together again in the future.""

Question 55:
SnakeArms: ""Hi Noel! In ALL of your interviews you've said that the original verses to 'Lock All The Doors' went to The Chemical Brother's 'Setting Sun’, which is weird, because the 1993 demos we have suggest that the songs original verses were instead used in 'My Sister Lover' and the verses that went to 'Setting Sun' came from a different demoed song 'Coming on Strong'. Have we missed something or does any of this sound true at all??
Oh, and what happened to 'Slow' and 'The Red, White & Blue'?!""

NG: ""You should bear in mind that my memory's not the best
If you're telling me it's from a different song, then I would probably agree
I'd like to think that the Chemical Brothers story is a better STORY though
So let's keep that between us.""

Question 56:
LittleWoodstock: ""Hey Noel, big fan of all your work!
Is your work any different with the High Flying Birds than it was with Oasis? Are there any aspects from the Oasis days you miss?""

NG: ""I miss... the camaraderie of being in a band, in the studio. That is to say, there are massive benefits - by makin' a record on your own, you can change direction very very quickly. And you don't have to run things by ""the committee"" of band members
On the other hand, it's great to share, you know... to share the greatness with other people, d'you know what I mean? If I can give you an analogy, you know, the more people at a party, the better
Shrugs
Although it's sometimes nice to party on your own.""

Question 57:
MONTREAL_COME_ON: ""WHY TORONTO AND NOT MONTREAL? we've got a better hockey club and our football team is getting better every year.""

NG: ""Because I went to a fucking donut shop once in Montreal, and all the staff spoke French! And last time I looked - France was on the other side of the fucking world
So I say to the people of Montreal - au revoir
Hahahaha!""

Question 58:
ExtremelySexyMan: ""Hey Noel, first off, huge fan, thanks for doing this
My question is, after writing great songs for more than 20 years now, where do you get your inspiration for new material? I imagine it to be the most difficult part of being a musician, and I am continually blown away by your work
Cheers, and go City!""

NG: ""Ehm... I guess I'm a product of my record collection, which is ever-expanding and gets ever-more eclectic. And I don't ever sit down when I'm writin' a song and feel like I've got anything profound to say to the universe... I just - to coin the phrase from that godawful film FROZEN... I just let it go... let it go!
Smiles""

Question 59:
Stevie_j: ""Noel, thanks for many years of amazing music. Please don't stop
Have you ever thought of doing a comedy tour? Seriously.""

330,Nothing Can Take The Place Of You,"I moved your pictures, from my walls
And I replaced them, both large and small
And each new day, finds me so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

I read your letters, one by one
And I still love you, when it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

As I, as I write this letter
It's raining, it's raining on my window pane
And, and I feel the need of you
You see, without you, nothing seems the same

So I'll wait, I'll wait until you're home
Again I love you, but right now I'm all alone
And oh my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you

Nothing can take the place, of your warm smile
Nothing can take the place, of the look in your eyes
Nothing can take the place, of your soft and tender touch
Nothing can take the place, of you, oh I miss you so much
Nothing can take the place, of your arms around me",Isaac Hayes,1969,"[75, 74, 80, 84, 89, 99]",6
331,First Hymn From Grand Terrace,"There was a hill we climbed
And a nursery rhyme
Went flying across the waving grass
Like, like silver bells
Against the curtain that the sky had made
Ooh, and so we played

It was a sunny day, and so we lay
Beneath the rock that sheltered us
From passing planes
And the earth caught fire when you turned
But nothing burned

There were nights when the lights
Would take us nowhere
For just a little while cars would pass
And we were out of gas
But we didn't care even though we walked a mile

There was a deejay in L.A
We used to tune in at night
To hear our favorite song
We always heard it at that perfect time
Up on that hill we climbed

And now you're gone and I'm alone
And though they say I should be
Safe, secure, and sane
Oh, I still remember yesterday
And the games that children play",Mark Lindsay,1969,"[81, 81, 83, 93]",4
332,Let Me Be The Man My Daddy Was,"[Verse 1]
He's worth more than every star in the sky
With that look of forgiveness that's always in his eyes
He works so hard, but gentle as a lamb
He gave up so much to make me just what I am

[Chorus]
Oh let me be the man my daddy was
Oh let me be the man my daddy was

[Verse 2]
When I was young, sometimes foolishly I played
But he reached out and, oh showed me the way
Now he's only human and bound to make mistakes
But it was all right by the moment I would awake

[Chorus]
Oh let me be the man my daddy was
Oh let me be the man my daddy was

[Bridge]
Sometimes I hope
I don't live to see the day
When he reaches down
And take them both away
And look at my children
Sometimes foolishly they play
Let me live long enough
Let me show them the way

[Verse 3]
My clothes were sometimes untidy
And that bed was never made
But mom and dad would scold me good
Never doubted I've made the grade
But now that I'm a man
I ask the Lord up above
Please let me raise my children right
And be the man my daddy was

[Chorus]
Oh let me be the man my daddy was
Oh let me be the man my daddy was

333,Love Theme From Romeo & Juliet,"What is a youth?
Impetuous fire
What is a maid?
Ice and desire
The world wags on

A rose will bloom
It then will fade
So does a youth
So does the fairest maid

Comes a time when one sweet smile
Has its season for awhile
Then Love's in love with me

Some may think only to marry
Others will tease and tarry
Mine is the very best parry
Cupid he rules us all

Caper the caper; sing me the song
Death will come soon to hush us along
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall
Love is a past time that never will pall
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall
Cupid he rules us all

Trying to get to Holland or France

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
""You can make it O.K
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain""

You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, ""Say what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace""

Christ you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
""Poor boy, when you're dead

That let's me know

If you took your heart and made it mine
I would be true till the end of time

And your doggone right oh baby
You brighten up baby each and every day that I have to face
And if the sunshine don't shine
You smile is there to take its place

Smooth and warm tender touch
Letting me know that it means so much
To be loved by somebody who is just as much in love with you

Sorry mom for all them times I got suspended in school
Gettin' footballer money, my teacher said I was a fool
Haters commenting on my 'Gram, that shit don't faze me
4 pipes on the Porsche, yo my whip so crazy
Told Pebz ""make sure you stay strapped""
I just left the label Christmas party to go and break down a pack
1a the hood, land all them shottas out of town
Went 'Dam for the plug, now we the opposite of down
Tryna leave a nigga's head by the pavement
Drivin' round in this dinger, gettin' impatient
Thinkin' that I shoulda spent more time with my nephew
It's fucked, seen them fake niggas shine seen the best lose
Pissed cuh my little nigga lost a few guns
Me and Pebz out in bail rollin' with some new ones
I get money every time my phone rings
Wasn't always fly, we had to grow wings
I'm still in the field where it's fucking real
I ain't got time to chill
I need a hundred mil
And way before the deal I paid my mother's bills
Tryna cop a house in the hills
That's how uncle Phil
Free my nigga Hydro, he just rang
When I sweep my floor
I'm finding bitches' earrings in my dust pan
Told my Misses that she can't fucking be my wife
Cuh I'm way too ambitious, you do nothin' with your life
Came a long way from 7 grams on the scale
Feels like yesterday I was banged up in jail
Now it's planes all the time, I be traveling the world
Fuck 'Dam, I'm goin' Spain they got ammi there for sale
But now I'm in the office, used to doin' business in the rain
Now it's house parties every week, Sydney and Sharane
Should I fall back off the trap
Put my whole into rap
Niggas keep callin' for packs
And I can't walk away from stacks
Heard he put down his gun and his mask
Tryna live off his rep, who gives a fuck what you done in the past
Got a deal, still tryna make it off the loud
Don't be standin' with them paigons, cuh I spray in the crowd
It's Nines...

[Skit 1: Nines]

Ay yo fuck the haters
Talkin' 'bout we're troublemakers
Everybody on me for a hundred favors
Me and Bund bunin' flavours

Used to say one day I'll be a baller, I was right
All these groupie bitches around the country wanna holla
Yea I fucked the fans, but don't judge me like your honour
Famous in the shooter
I just came from the jeweler
Immigration wanna dip my chain back to Cuba
Did alright last year, probably shoulda saved more
Lookin' through The Sun I see my ting on page 4
I'm gettin' bait, I gotta hide my face
Still got crackheads whistling outside the base
I just stay in my lane, I ain't worried 'bout them broke haters

Send my yungens shop for a box of latex

Or most of them, are ridin' bird right now bludLucky I was flyin' birds

Obviously I was payin' for all this shit myself
I could honestly say, I don't know how much I faulked into music
Mad Ps probably, I don't know

Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper

Verse 1 [Element]
I stay relentless to your defenses
Pretentiousness is defenseless
That kill list is an immense list
But the ones unmarked are endless
I got a pen listed as a weapon
And this track right here is the setting
Preventing your conception
I got your whole convention fenced in
Never resting staying up all night tryna write what’ll surely make a head spin
But the people don’t feel cuz I’m unimpressed with obsessing over monetary pensions
And possessions I don’t focus on I turned my motives on to possessing
People over my age and below to follow what I’m offering inside of my lessons
So fuck the worth of them green notes
Fuck rapping ‘bout weed smoke
I know you’re big on the TV and you don’t even see me but I got the remote
I can mute the volume, turn it off
I can’t make the people unlearn the songs
But up against me you’re just hitting yourself with no results like you’re tryna fucking jerk it soft
I gotta hit em with the syllables ripping just like an animal till I don’t even know what fucking word I’m on
Slaughtering the defense like I’m Michael Vick and to you and your dawgs, man, I murdered y’all
Word to all you know I got the heat and I won’t hesitate for a second just to turn it on
I don’t need the money for a new wardrobe, cuz I don’t even have a single fucking shirt that’s on

Second verse just the first but reversed
Dispersing these words to the person that works
To the person that’s thoroughly discerned from the perks
Of a desk job office his earnings are burnt
He’s a casualty of these damaging taxes attacking his family
Calamity so you don’t have a real reason to be mad at me
When I rap like this cuz I’m anti-pissed on
You’re the tit that I latch my lips on
Every time you fuck up big I’ma suck that tit till the milk in it’s gone
You don’t stand a chance of advancing after the fact when I’ve written this song
New World padawan add it on to the past accomplishments my force is strong
I’ve become a little numb to my senses
Rapping like I’m senseless never did I mention
A pension material possessions just blessed with the best gift that could’ve been from the heavens
I ain’t never been much of a reverend
Never much reverence towards the seven
Never thought about heavenly ascension
Or transported to a hellish dimension
I just know I’m a little demented
With no mention to when I try to blend in
As a legendary penman with pens as his weapons
Start some shit and I’ll end it
When I call em’ out I got a million rappers tryna come back in and seek their redemption
But they fail to realize that Element’s a motherfucking beast and I’m staying RELENTLESS

353,Black Pearl,"[Intro]
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong

[Verse 1]
Comin at'cha, can you feel what I'm feelin'
Some soul sister need some natural healing
Gifted but shifted, so come follow me
Cause I'mma take you on a sister to sister journey
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

You've been in the background much too long

[Verse 2]
Now, all my sisters with the bangles, tryin' on earings
Tryin shopping with the Fendi's and ain't got a penny
High school drop-out, only sixteen like she don't know no better
Don't think it's a crime, cause nobody's there to tell her
Life is scarce, if you don't take a chance you're losin honey
The streets'll be the only place you make your money
Let's get it together, that's the price you have to pay
And if you live for the streets you'll see a better day
One nation, under the groove, we got it open
If we'd just learn to stick together, you know what I mean?
Stop killin' each other, learn to love each other
For the sake of a mother and a brother
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
You've been in the background much too long

[Verse 3]
What I'm kickin ain't no joke, you better listen up
Black black pressure, and pretty black pearl
Yeah, I done been around the world and it's still all the same
Everybody's still got a little shame in they game
Scared to admit, well here's something you can lean on
Hum the chorus to this song...
It's a lot of strings attched don't let him play you like a buppy
You gotta stay above it or your just like the rest of 'em
Following some dry-ass dream, scared to move on and be more than you friends
Self-motivation, for your self-motivate set the two
Black Pearl's dedicated from Yo to you
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
Now tell me what's wrong with being strong

355,The Days Of Sand And Shovels,"When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
And her nose was pressed against the window pane

When she looked at me
She smiled and showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom
If she could come outside and play with me

We became as one and
Had a love without beginning or an end
And every day she lived with me
Was like a new day dawning once again

Chorus:
And I've loved her since
Every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

After many years our love grew silent
And at night I heard her cry
When she left me in the fall
I knew that it would be our last goodbye

I was man enough to give her everything
She needed for a while
But in searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child

Girl you're too young, you don't know what love is about, please listen to
Me and stop running your mouth. Girl you're too young, you don't know what
Love is about, please listen to me and stop run up your mouth. Listen
Love is for shaming, love is for giving, love is what makes this world go
Round, round and round, round and round, round and round…

Little girl take yourself up from off the ground. Please listen to me and
Stop running around, like a clown. ""Mhhhm, ladadaaa""
You're too young, please understand me, right now. Girl you're too young
You don't know, what love is about. (Music plays...)

Little girl take yourself up from off the ground. Please listen to me and
Stop running around. Girl you're too young, you don't know what love is
About. Please listen to me and stop run up your mouth. Listen, love is for
Shaming, love is for giving, love is what makes this world go round, round
And round, round and round, round and round…

358,In The Ghetto,"[Busta Rhymes]
You know, my homey Treach from Naughty By Nature once said
If you ain't from the ghetto, don't come to the fucking ghetto
But I'mma let one of our most immaculate tour guides
Take us all through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!

[Rick James - sampled from ""Ghetto Life""] + (backup singers)
When I was a young boy, growing up in the ghetto!
Hanging out on corners, singing with the fellas
Looking for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Looking for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking about (Talking about ghetto life)
(Talking about ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singing about (Talking about ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking about ghetto life)

[Busta Rhymes]
(In the ghetto) Sure we be taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be popping off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood until somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle until we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

(In the ghetto) That's where we get into that street shit
Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smuggle babies in they belly
And then piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nothing like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it

(In the ghetto) Even though they act rude
You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people, I love that!

371,Willie & Laura Mae Jones,"Willie & Laura Mae Jones
Were our neighbours a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack

The people worked the land together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have the time to think about another man's colour

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

Sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and the kids would sing
And everybody would mess around
Daddy'd bring out his guitar
And play on through the night
Every now and then ol' Willie would grin and say
""Hey, you play all right""
Made me feel so good

I remember the best times of all
When Saturday came around

We all would stop by Willie's house and say
""Do y'all need anything from town?""
He'd say ""No, but why don't y'all stop on the way back through?
And I'll get Laura Mae, yeah, to cook up some barbecue""
And you know that's good

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time

Oh, the years rolled past the land
And took back what they'd given
We all knew we had to move
If we were gonna make a living

So we all moved off
And went about our separate ways
It sure was hard to say goodbye
To Willie and Laura Mae (Jones), oh yeah

The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine, yes it was
But that was another place and another time
I remember so well
The cotton looked so fine
But that was another place and another time
And it felt so good, yes it did",Dusty Springfield,1969,"[78, 78, 88]",3

Last name Ever, first name Greatest

She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness

Ain't no question who about to kill 'em

I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

There are no gloomy skies

Of those who are blessed with love

And the sweet secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere
Where two people share
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love

They conquer then they leave

With man-eating beliefs
Superior of death
With lineage and myth
And a half-heartedness at birth

I have the same old dream
About a tunnel by my bed
From where the stench of shit of minotaurs
Yawns like lewd and evil breath

But instinct and a map
Has set to work inside my head
Instead of shedding tears
I've learned to drink and piss instead

They come, they go
They never do not go
They come, they see
They conquer then they leave

I am in Rome
And i am going to the games
I see the gulf
And it's going to
Bore my name into the

Green green grass
The catwalks of the past
My head is like an oven
As i rest it in my palms

We were just standing on the beach
When a bull rose from the surf
I said ""show him the back door my dear
He'll only paw the turf""

Three seasons came and went
Tracksuits found the dispossessed
My wife had other plans
And now a bastard surfs the web

There's nothing she can do
He does not talk, he does not move
He spends all day looking at porn
Or playing fucking Halo 2

They come, they go
They never do not go
They come, they see
They conquer then they leave

I am in Rome
And i am going to the games
I am the last to find my seat
I'm standing at the gate

384,I'm Still A Struggling Man,"[Verse 1]
You better stop fooling if you want to get along with me
We grew up on the block and we know about poverty
So, tell all your high-falutin' friends we just can't compete

I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl

I'm still a struggling man
Doing the best that I can
I can only take it, girl, I can only make it, girl

385,Never Comes The Day,"Work away today, work away tomorrow
Never comes the day for my love and me
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away
If only you knew what's inside of me now
You wouldn't want to know me somehow
But
You will love me tonight
We alone will be alright
In the end

Give just a little bit more
Take a little bit less
From each other tonight
Admit what you're feeling
And see what's in front of you
It's never out of your sight
You know it's true
We all know that it's true

Work away today, think about tomorrow
Never comes the day for my love and me
I feel her gently sighing as the evening slips away
If only you knew what's inside of me now
You wouldn't want to know me somehow

You will love me tonight

386,Wake Up,"[Verse 1]
'Cause we've been driving so long
I can't remember how we got here
Or how we survived so long
Out trying to run from our pride
'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
And I remember how I spent the twenty-third
Feeling six feet under
When I'm thirty-thousand feet in the air
Chasing that sundown
So far east I'm westbound
Feeling like the edge of this world is near

[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to god I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
This is more than just a phase, love
Shooting stars all break up
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things will be better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million, anyway?

[Verse 2]
'Cause you see only what you want to
Your tunnel vision owns you
And you can't see what's wrong
When you keep sleeping through the PM
Eyes wide open when you're dreaming
You’re sleepwalking, just keep talking
Maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
No B-plan in your system
Just tell me what you're thinking
I'm scared that you might fall
But you're not
But you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Taking off your makeup
Sun always seems to wash our fears away
And it's always shining somewhere
I just gotta get there
And even though it seems like half the world away
Things are better in America
Heard the streets are gold there
Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

[Chorus]
Stay, you're not gonna leave me
This place is right where you need to be
And why your words gotta mean so much to them
And they mean nothing to me?
So stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million?

[Bridge]
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
You’re so much better than that
Stay, you're not what you're hearing
'Cause I've been watching you changing
And who said you're one in a million anyway?

[Outro]
And you'll feel better when you wake up
Swear to God, I'll make up
Everything and more when I get back someday
Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocaine
Screaming through your airwaves
Looking back I almost thought I heard you say:

But you're never too old to learn
Stop worryin' about your neighbors
And the fancy things they've got

You're gonna wind up on the spot, oh

Are tryin' to keep up too
Remember that old sayin'; ""All that glitters ain't gold""
Take heed, don't ignore it, and to your money tightly hold, oh

You better leave the Joneses alone

You better leave, oh leave, the Joneses alone, uh-huh

Joneses got a new car today

So leave (boom boom) the Joneses alone

Don't let the Joneses blow your mind

Now listen, if you see somethin' you want
And you know you can't afford it

Is start saving towards it
The Joneses have been the downfall
Of many a person you see
So, people, take my advice
And let the Joneses be, ow

Don't let the Joneses get you down, whoa, down

I'll try to make her happy
And I promise I'll be good
I'll play it by the rules
Just like every lover should
In times that I will fail her
And we let each other down
But I'm sure that we can make it
As long as you're around
So won't you
Welcome me love
My name is lonely
Tell that girl that I think I'm her only
I want you with pride
So help me like the light in her eyes
Welcome me love
I know you don't know me
Take my hand there's a lot you can show me
I want you with pride
So help me like the light in her eye",Brooklyn Bridge,1969,"[54, 49, 48, 48, 48, 49, 62, 85, 93]",9

[Интро: СД]
СД, Oxxxymiron
Че

[Куплет 1: Oxxxymiron]
Микро сверкает, будто пятки твоей crew
Ты планируешь, будто бы куропатки на ветру
Не сорваться вниз, но ты пацифист, а мы Bloods и Crips
Ты нужен, как китайцам рис, в Турции - антифриз
Делай ноги, будто кукольная фабрика
Ты демагог и на демо пукаешь как от паприки
Ты лепишь горбатого, будто бы для пластилинового
Римейка на ""Место встречи изменить нельзя""
Ты из 70-ых стиль - ретро
Сменяю штиль ветром
Тебе зажжёный фитиль в уретру - курить вредно!
Твоя команда подчиняется инстинкту
И, слыша мою команду, сокращается как сфинктер
Oxxxymiron, как дождь или гром
Ты стираешь бельё, я - твой CD-ROM
Ты на коксе верхом или бокс-чемпион?
Ну и что, мы приходим за тобой всемером
Я тот, кто тебя рвёт по перфорации
Тот, кто во время танцев твою дочь первый мацает
Хоуми, я помню её со всеми вытекающими
В том числе моё из неё семя вытекающее
СД прикроет спину, нет двойной лояльности
Вам жить не под силу, будто бы вдвоём рояль нести
Реальнее, что Безруков будет номинирован на Оскар
Я беру бензопилу и ты бездарь без рук, как Венера Милосская

[Припев: СД]
Special Delivery, русрэп какой-то ливерный
Русрэп какой-то для детей, прям как товар от Libero, слышь!
Special Delivery, выход есть - их выпороть
Бить с этих недопушкиных прыть уже давно пора, слышь!
Special Delivery, русрэп какой-то ливерный
Русрэп какой-то для детей, прям как товар от Libero, слышь!

[Куплет 2: СД]
Ты плохо спишь ночами, девки не замечают тебя
Каждый день печален и параход твой отчалил
Улетаешь за грачами и взиму, весной в начале
Ты вернёшься, но даже мать родная тебя не встречает
Ты петух, но топчут все тебя, а не ты всех
Смирись, мой милый друг, - ты онанист
И begging - твой глупый каприз
И выход есть - с Останскинской башни задорно башкой вниз
И все споют: ""Фу лололох!"" - но эта песня не фью джис
На Coddy продакшн рубим так что, похуй на ваш статус даже
СД маньяк очень страшный, чёрный Мэнсон с этого мажет
Пью всё время на районе, но этого места нет на карте:
Jack Daniel's, Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal и Bacardi Black
Я не black, но фору дам всем их чтецам
Я спец по устройству пиздеца
Твоя мама любит вкус моего конца
Твоя тёлка думает обо мне 365 дней в году
Ты так любишь её, пишешь стихи. Я трахал её сонною друг
Прости меня друг, но просто нельзя быть таким мудаком, как ты. Это бред
Он как в яслях твой мозг вряд ли прохавает даже этот куплет
Дайте медаль тому кто продал мне ствол, он эту медаль заслужил
Вчера я убил орду мудаков, терпеть их рэп уже не было сил
Ты продан на органы, ты педик
Ломать тебе пальцы - мой фетиш
Поверь мудачок на этой планете точно тебе ничего не светит!
Слышь!

[Припев: СД]

На море волны, но чисты пески на дне
Я русский рэп свожу практически на нет
Даю вам в рот свой генетический комплект
Ты скушный, как политический памфлет
Я утопил тебя практически в говне
Твоя жена сушит мои носки в окне
Пластинка не твоя, один лишь скит на ней
Так что не качай права и просто сгинь! (СД)

[Куплет 4: СД]
Oxxxymiron и СД, Москва-Лондон. Слейся бездарь!
Мы мощнее чем ты страшнее чем ты, и в копи тебе нету места
Громко орёшь мол хватит-хватит
Ночью ты меряешь мамино платье
Тебя в зоопарк бы сдать - больше толку будет. Сдохни приятель!
Если мы пишем дисс на тебя, намыль веревку и накинь петлю
Нам похуй на то кто ты, слушай, щенок, что я сейчас говорю
Кстати маман твоя просила передать, что ты ошибка
И не рэппер ты - твой флоу всего лишь брызгами кал жидкий
Слышь!

402,"Friend, Lover, Woman, Wife","Well, she's a friend, she's a lover
She's a woman, she's a wife
She's the answer to the prayer that every lonely man dreams of
She's a temptress, she's a lady
She's the mother of my baby
And I thank God that I'm the lucky man she loves

Sometimes I lie awake and watch her sleeping
And I just wanna bust and love drops fill my eyes
I wonder what she'd think if she woke up and caught me weeping
'Cause daddy's heroes ain't supposed to cry

You know the morning always seems to catch us laughing
We got the baby in the bed between us safe and warm
And I thank the Lord above for all the good times I'm having
Wrapped up in my woman's loving arms

'Cause she's a friend, she's a lover
She's a woman, she's a wife
She's the answer to the prayer that every lonely man dreams of
She's a temptress, she's a lady
She's the mother of my baby
And I thank God that I'm the lucky man she loves

When the load gets heavy on my shoulders
I can't keep the pace and I need a place to hide
I run home to my own little world and take her in my arms and hold her
And I soon forget that there's another world outside

Well, she's a friend, she's a lover
She's a woman, she's a wife

I have so many pairs of rose-tinted glasses
Unfair how you took so many advances
Straight I'll look or I'll catch your glances

[Verse 1: Will Haynes]
I miss you its true you had me in trances
What you a gypsy doing straight magic
Get you a billi and drop through the masses
Beauty blinded me, need some glasses
Remember the first three months like its tragic
Quite the contrary like living in palaces
Life is legendary like riding on pegasus
Come sit with us til you get sick of us
Come deal with us til you finish us
Can't pillage us we the villagers
Don't fight back we use our words
Like Iraq you bombing in stores
Like Ash Ketchum I got a lure
So well together you siamese
I'm the fella to find these
Say please I'll get on my knees
It ain't a problem I'll do it for free
I'm ignorant don't rely on me
Never on time not one to compete
I'm winning time, believe me

[Hook]
And who are these new people you been with?
I know they're privileged, I can tell it
You know you're different
Remember that shit
You don't have to do it
You're born with it
Never let me meet them
You hiding shit
What is it between us?
No longer close knit
Can't feel your energy, did you abandon it?
I was with you at recovery
You know this

[Verse 2: Will Haynes]
Watch you throw the cocoa out the window
Take that away I love to crescendo
I've never been one for innuendos
Choose it well got time like a slim bow
One on one never took the hit though
Wanted you more than these bimbos
Always hug you with some clean clothes
Pick you up on Ventura I always drove
I can see it in your eyes sanpaku eye holes
Driving fast like you backwards J.O
If anything don't call her hoe
(What you call me?)
Then you know it's time to go
Anywhere just hang down low
Without her I can't feel whole
Don't think like that it's time to grow
Being alone brings strength you know
Don't go too far make smiles and faces glow
Wrong moves OK just know where to go
Sometime you won't know just believe though
Can't be tempted
It's impressive, I know

[Hook]
And who are these new people you been with?
I know they're privileged, I can tell it
You know you're different
Remember that shit
You don't have to do it
You're born with it
Never let me meet them
You hiding shit
What is it between us
No longer close knit
Can't feel your energy, did you abandon it?
I held your hand through recovery

Lets here it for the monkey!
Whooooo!

412,Day Is Done,"[Verse 1]
When the day is done
Down to earth, then, sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done

[Verse 2]
When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you began
When the day is done

[Verse 3]
When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold

[Verse 4]
When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
When the bird has flown

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
When the game's been fought
Newspaper blown across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought

[Verse 6]
When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to start anew
Now the party's through

[Verse 7]
When the day is done
Down to earth, then, sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won

413,The April Fools,"In an April dream
Once you came to me
When you smiled, I looked into your eyes
And I knew I'd be loving you
And then you touched my hand
And I learned, April dreams can come true

Oh, we're just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
If we're just April fools
I don't care
True love has found us now

Little did we know
Where the road would lead
Here we are a million miles away from the past
Travelin' so fast
Now, there's no turning back
If our sweet April dream doesn't last

Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us
If we're just April fools
I don't care
We'll find our way somehow
No need to be afraid
True love has found us now",Dionne Warwick,1969,"[44, 37, 37, 40, 47, 56, 77]",7
414,I Can't Quit Her,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I can't quit her
She's got a hold on me
She got her hand on my soul
I can't quit her
Cause I see her face everywhere I go

[Chorus 1]
In the city streets, in the country fields
In the back of my mind
I know it can't be real
For a woman to possess
All the tenderness she had
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me
Yeah, I know

[Verse 2]
I can't quit her
Cause on my darkest night
She comes on like a light
I can't quite her
Try as I may, with all my might
She had a woman's touch
And a young girls eyes
And in seconds flat I was pros'lytized
Turned around
And made to feel sweet love
But the hands of time
Keep tickin' on my back
Cause it's been so long
Since I had her back beside me

[Bridge]
True love is somethin'
Ev'ry young boy knows about
And he fights his whole soul all the best to find some
I was a young boy
'till I held her in my arms
Now I find that I'm strung out behind some

[Verse 3]
I can't quit her
She got her hand on me
She got a hold on my soul
Cause I your face everywhere I go
I can't quit her, woo ooo yeah
I know
You know I see your face
Everywhere I go!
I need her...I need the little girl","Blood, Sweat & Tears",1969,"[75, 67, 72, 76, 80]",5
415,Dammit Isn't God's Last Name,"Was a time I felt I was the only bad luck charm
Thought I lived an honest life
Not doing nobody no harm
Well I got me that son
I always dreamed about
When he was born man did a jump and shout

Well one old day
He fell down sick
With something that had no name
Everybody shook their heads and called it a crying shame, well
I did what I never did before
Fell down on my knees and prayed
And he pulled through and only God knows how
And I got a debt unpaid

That's when I learned that dammit isn't God's last name
No Dammit isn't God's last name

I know many men who have no faith in the power of heaven above
But there's a force who lives our lives on not but straight out loving
And if you need help take a tip from me
You can get that help and the price is free
You have troubles everyone does
Don't blame something you don't know
Go find a place to be alone and spill your tale of woe
Don't be scared if you ain't never prayed and you blasphemed all of your life
God has infinite mercy on your soul
Could lose your yesterdays

You're going to learn that Dammit isn't god's last name
No Dammit isn't god's last name
No Dammit isn't god's last name
No dammit isn't god's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name
No dammit isn't God's last name",Frankie Laine,1969,"[86, 87, 87]",3
416,Gotta Get To Know You,"I made up my mind
And here's my decision
I'd like to share with you
All of my secrets and my religion

I want you to see
Oh, how sweet I could be
Oh, I just got to get to know you
I just got to get to know you

You got what it takes
Lord, there's no denying
I see in you, a dream come
Lord, You're life to the dying

Looking at you is like a baby dream

In my life, there's an empty slot
Lord, I believe You can fill that spot

To go back where love wasn't jumbled so

Hrmgg... Ohio's my... City...

Hello folks, my name's Jonathan Flores
I get on the server to play some Sky Wars
I like to do some water MLG
I can even do it without any energy

*brother jeremiah nasal snorting*

Gonna shoot some guy right into the void
It's the 1v1 final with my friend Lloyd
My friend Lloyd is a little pathetic
He's dying on purpose for the win-rate aesthetic

Let's join in for this 1v1v1
Gonna let you know that you're the ugly ugly one
But are you allowed to rhyme one with one?
It's redundant, like saying there's a sunny sun

Well this guy's dead, falling into the pit
Trying to give me an L, 'cause he's a piece of bad
Over here, you'll see this flaming lad
Burned to death by my mixtape, that's pretty sad

Now we cut the crap, 'cause it's Bed Wars time
My team's so bad, that it's a mortal crime
Can't defend the bed, but it doesn't matter
Between my bed or emeralds, I'd choose the latter

Think the time's right for me to get revenge
It's easier than sucking on a lemon lozenge
Yellow team's pissed when their bed's destroyed
When I wipe them out, they're gonna feel like Lloyd

When I kill this man, he will complain and gripe
The coolio shot, and the world's best snipe
Now you might point out that I'm doing some boasting
But you can't go back to bread if It's already toasting

Invisible man jumps right to his death
I'm gonna drop on this guy like I'm the Boyardee Chef
Throwing my ender pearl, It's the final kill
Arrow in the dark, he disappears. Where's Bill?

I'd like to start the game by defeating team red
First I'm gonna need to destroy their bed
These young folks are getting killed left and right
This guy's standing still, don't want to put up a fight

Red man thinks he's cool, trying to shoot me with his bow
Little does he know, I'm right here, you toe!
The game's mostly over 'cause I got the red bed
One versus three well that's easy as dead!

Now my loser brother's gonna take the mic
You can call him Jeremiah 'cause he rides his bike
One last arrow's gonna finish the game
Jeremiah come hither to claim your fame

(fades to Jeremiah)
BROTHER JEREMIAH!
I EAT A PAPAYA!
I WAN'T TO DIE-A!

***** MY PANTS!
EATING SOME ANTS!

I LIKE TO EAT CHEESE!

I EAT GEESE!
CHEESE GEESE!

(fades back to happyheart)
Thank you my brother
Jeremiah will be back, but first I have a question
Do you want depression?
You don't even have to ask

Well
Hypixel sucks, and the people are upset
They're calling Ls, no money, they're in lot's of debt
They are terrible even in their hardest sweat
Can objectively say, money is what you should get

As I make more content, you will lose more brains
I will make more porridge and you're going insane
But it doesn't matter because at least I'm better
Than the nose-fat hooligans passing chain letters

Hello everyone! Bonjour trout le monde!
Now listen to this nightmare that I have spawned
I call it, ""Le rap de depression crippled""
So far, my depression has only tripled

Want depression?
You don't even have to ask
Need depression? You got it!

Want depression? You don't even have to ask!
Enduring French is an impossible task
Uh oh! I guess my screen froze
Will it cost me the game? HA NO WAY JOSE!

Hypixel and French both stepping on my toes
You can eat my fat, you need to grow a nose
En danse the hip hop, lose a brainwave
Hip dislocation and hop to your grave

Speak the English and you lose the carte
Cured your depression? you'll have to restart!

I go 1v4 in the enemy bases
Most people here can't tie their own laces

Hey there stranger, you've arrived in SuckTown
Everyone here seems to play like clowns
Hey there stranger, you've arrived in French
Hope you don't mind the god-awful stench

I'm gonna leave now, France is not my city
Shame Hypixel sucks so much, man, it's a pity!
Le classe de francais est le root of all depression
Symptoms knows; cerebrospinal degradation

Aujourd'jui, je wear my souliers black
French class always gives me chronic heart attack
Want depression? I never even asked
Depression can't be escaped, but it can be masked

French class makes me SAD; Seasonal Affective Disorder
Creepergirllindy wants me not to report her
High school's where French class starts to be depressing
Hypixel high school role-play is an issue that needs addressing

Brother Jeremiah, you can take the lead again
Now you can make money, now you can get brain

(fades to Jeremiah)
TAKES PHOTOS OF GIRLS WITHOUT ASKING!
HEY! WANNA SEE THIS THING?
SNAP SNAP SNAP, THEY WILL NEVER KNOW, HA HA HA!

AND I QUOTE!
I'M BROTHER JEREMIAH!
AND I EAT A PAPAYA!
I'M NOT ATTRACTED TO GUYS-A!

BECAUSE I FOLLOW THE CRISTIAN WAY!
AND THAT MEANS YOU CANT BE --Y!
PRAY TO JESUS ALL DAY!
FATHER JEREMIAH NOW!
CAUSE I KILLED THE OTHER GUY, OH WOW!

I'M THE LEADER OF THE CHURCH!
I'M SELLING MERCH!
YOU BETTER NOT LURK FOR MY CHURCH!
BECAUSE I'LL FIND YOU!

(fades back to happyheart)
Thanks again, Jeremiah
We had some good times
Made lotta cash
Let's take out the trash

While it's true Hypixel's players are, you might say, atrocious
Remember Mineplex players also aren't too precocious
It's Everyday Bro was a tragedy at best
But not everybody can be musically blessed

So now we're left with French class, but we can't make any concessions

421,The Windmills Of Your Mind,"[Verse 1]
Round like a circle in a spiral
Like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning
On an ever spinning reel

Like a snowball down a mountain
Or a carnival balloon
Like a carousel that's turning
Running rings around the moon

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 2]
Like a tunnel you can follow
To a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern
Where the sun has never shone

Like a door that keeps revolving
In a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble
Someone tosses in a stream

Like a clock whose hands are sweeping
Past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple
Whirling silently in space

Like the circles that you find
In the windmills of your mind

[Verse 3]
Keys that jingle in your pocket
Words that jangle in your head
Why did Summer go so quickly
Was it something that you said?

Lovers walk along a shore
And leave their footprints in the sand
Was the sound of distant drumming
Just the fingers of your hand?

Pictures hanging in a hallway
Or the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces
But to whom do they belong?

When you knew that it was over
Were you suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning
To the colour of her hair

A circle in a spiral
A wheel within a wheel
Never ending nor beginning

Has stopped us here
It twirled a time or two
And then it dropped us here

To take your hand
How would you stand?

My nigga got popped, can't believe that they did it
Case you don't notice, I get a little emotional
They fucked my boy over, I'm back in my feelings
This rap shit get crazy, won't go back to dealing
I smoke all this weed so sometimes I won't feel it
Got my heart broke when I was young so I'm bad with women
All them hard times so I had to get it
Corner store hustling, we was some youngsters
Skippin' school daily, tryna get some money
So many people done folded on me
'Member that time they had the hold on me
Got out and got me a sack, got me a pack
Hit my mans, said I'm back
I don't want no more thrax, I'm back in the kitchen with crack
Cook it up and make it back

When I got this tat on my stomach

I fell in love with the junkies
I fell in love with that corner store money
Them junkies was comin', them junkies was comin'
Back and forth, man them junkies was comin'

Got me a quarter then got me a hundred
Got me a self then got me a half
Then broke this shit down and went got me an onion
Gotta stick with your pack and your job 'cause these niggas be stealin'

426,What Is A Man,"[Verse 1]
A man can walk proudly
Down in the street
A man's not ashamed of what he believes
He knows how to laugh
He knows when to cry
He knows it's best to live
He's afraid to die

[Chorus]
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?

[Verse 2]
A man searches
For the key to success
He'd rather be sure
Than take a wild guess
He knows how to love
He knows how to hate
He knows when to move
He knows just when to wait

[Chorus]
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?

[Verse 3]
A man can be angry
And still hold his tongue
A man don't give up
Till the battle is won
He knows how to win
He's not ashamed to lose
He knows his destiny
Is his alone to choose

[Chorus]
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
What is a man?
Just what is a man?",The Four Tops,1969,"[61, 53, 53, 53, 63, 74, 94]",7
427,I Could Never Lie To You,"[몬스타엑스 - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 가사]

[Verse 1: I.M, Hyungwon, and Minhyuk]
You make me wanna run it all back
Nobody's ever done me like that
I thought I'd never ever need you
Now all I wanna do is see you
I shouldn't let it happen so fast
Girl, why'd you have to break me like that?
Your love is nothing but a see-through
I tell myself that I should leave you

[Pre-Chorus: Wonho & Joohoney]
But who, I don't wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you're taking home
'Cause I can't lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I'm picking up the phone

[Chorus: Kihyun & Shownu]
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
'Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the night
You've got me
You've got me
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You've got me
You've got me

[Verse 2: I.M, Hyungwon, and Minhyuk]
Remember all the nights like this?
Sleeping in the Motel 6
We'd take all of the backstreets home
Making sure your friends don't know
I never thought it'd get like this
Still think about the very first kiss
But I could never lie to you
I'm going out my mind for you

[Pre-Chorus: Wonho & Joohoney]
But who, I don't wanna know
Where you wanna go
Who you're taking home
'Cause I can't lose everything I know
I hate sleeping alone
I'm picking up the phone

[Chorus: Kihyun & Shownu]
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
'Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the night
You've got me
You've got me
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You've got me
You've got me
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
'Cause I can never wait for the morning to rise
We're kissing in the car underneath of the night
You've got me
You've got me
And I'll be on the way in the middle of night
It's something in the way you've been running my mind
If you want me to stay for the rest of my life
You've got me
You've got me

Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

[Thee Tom Hardy - V1]
Let’s blaze, what a way to escape
What’s a way for you to waste away your days of mistakes?
Eyes glossy, glazed-over like, donuts and cakes
You’re happy with somebody so you wish and hope that it’s fate
But what if it’s fake? Hell of a scam, the whole time
All for the pie, you know, key lime
If it all ended today, at least you tried
It was a nice ride, time to go inside
Yourself and take a look at the person and how it’s hurtin’
Like how could somebody love you for years and then desert ya
What’s the whole purpose? Experience of learning?
Exterior is strong but inside you’re certainly burning
Take two of these that’s the remedy for anything
You could be happy or else, at least pretend to be
Own biggest enemy, killing self slow
They tell you hold on loose but never let go

[Hook]
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

[Tunji - V2]
Yo
I still remember the first time I realized that life wasn’t picture perfect
My father packing up his things to leave his kids deserted
The rain reflecting off the windows as it hit the surface
I wonder if he thinks the shit was worth it
As I sit here and write another one
Puffin on another blunt
Zonin til’ my buzz is done
Proud to be my mother’s son
See, she taught me to always be calm and pensive
And live my life without ever regrettin mistakes and consequences
My strongest lessons as a young fella
You see I’ve done hella runnin through the rain with no umbrella
But no complainin it just forced us to become better
Wintertime – one sweater
Dinnertime – crumbs fed us
I sit and think about the wisdom that I’ve gained
Reminiscin as I listen to the rhythm of the rain
I’m driven and persistent with my vision and my aim
If I did it all again I would live this all the same

[Hook]
Dancing to the rhythm of the rain
How could I﻿ go wrong?
I was ruling my mind
I must have been blind

[Kno - V3]
Yo, uh
I’m storm chasing
And she’s an F-5 with a sex drive that’ll leave me tied to her bedside
Hurricane hips, stoppin all progression
Serotonin levels drop, tropical depression
She is my professor and I’ve been taught a lesson
That in the eye of the storm the pressures barometric
She knows I’m wary of her game plan
But when she gambles she can count on me
I’m her Rain Man
Damn shame man, the fly stewardess
Mental turbulence, head off in the cumulus
Blaming the weather or whatever for her moodiness
My main star but I’m barely on her radar
And so my heart sinks – or the pain floats
I’m in a shit storm, shoulda wore a raincoat
The clouds break and I can tell its over
Cause she’s my sunshine but I’m catching melanoma

432,Sincerely,"[Verse 1]
I'm calling this the love crusade
The truth is like a black bouquet
Money's got us all enslaved
The bullets and the bombs we make, oh, no
It doesn't have to be this way
But I promise it'll stay this way
If you would rather hear me say
That everything is all okay
I don't care for your drugs, I don't care for your fame
Do you care for the truth if you're not entertained?
I can see through your eyes, I can see through your pain
And you're scared to admit, you feel out of place

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, the world looks perfect from a plane
A couple miles up and we all look the same
One love tryna show us the way
One love that is trying to change
And if we connect with that, then we should be enraged
These fat cats want us lost in the maze
And they're scared 'cause we're breaking the chain
They're scared 'cause we're 'bout to escape

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love
Sincerely

[Bridge]
There's a billion people
That could use a hero
Come together, we're the tether
Of this love that's spinning 'round
We could be that miracle

[Chorus]
Can you hear that, darling?
A revolution's calling
No child of ours should have to starve
Should have to die for us
Can you feel that, darling?
The monster's marching
This is it, this invitation is
For the ones who love

But if fun time??? come admitten' comes a feeling
I'll be splitting

Don't know where
I'm heading for
There's one thing I'm sure of
Just as soon as I get there, baby
I'll be feeling like
Traveling on once more

Baby, now that you understand
Well, there's no reason for sorrow
You know, I'm the son of a travelin' man
Here today, gone tomorrow

From Boston to Charleston
Wherever the four winds blow
I'm restless, I'm ready
There's a rainbow for me to follow
Anywhere that it leads me
I must go!

Miami, the heart is there
Atlanta, New Orleans
Columbus or anywhere

Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day

I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye

Goodbye, bye

Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye

Goodbye!

Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave

Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you

I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmmmm

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages, I come lookin' for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, lalalalalalala

[Verse 4]
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me
Leadin' me
Goin' home

In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

443,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool

I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had

Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried

So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'

If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away",Bob Dylan,1969,"[86, 85, 89, 92, 99]",5

Yo Jacky, this Keith
It's the answering machine

There's some meat up in the closet
If you goin through it out tonight
I'mma run up to Tower Records to get a pizza
Aight
Ima come back
Yeah

[Verse 1: Dr. Dooom]
Chewin alligator meat live cowsteak
Sittin on old newspapers by the kitchen sink
You think im off limits driving a 74 Dodge Plymouth
Up the street with human feet colored apple-green
With spots eatin' blueberry Pop Tarts
With the eighth body in my trunk my elbow bleeds with lumps
Walkin from the sanitation dump with rotten skulls
On my waterbed with Miller beer kegs
Blood in my cabinet, ears in my closet
Watchin the Raptors play the Houston Rockets
With your arms in the freezer I grab a icicle
Puttin fingerprints on my bicycle
Walkin up to have a drink at the club ?there is? three Irish chicks
Lookin at me like I'm sick
Walkin by chin-chins I stole the keys from ya friends
Lookin out ya Mondrian hotel window like Elvis Presley
Coming down the elevator
Good evening mister excuse me pardon me with body parts
And credit cards walkin down Sunset Boulevard past the red light
I threw a rat with mayonnaise at ya head lights
Four blonde girls screamed and put on their hi-beams
I fake like I'm vomiting smoking cigs threw acid on their stomach
And drove of with a wig down La Brea listen to a tape by Slayer
Parked in a parking lot behind Burger King
Eatin a raw pack of chicken wings
With blood on my fingers I blast a CD by the Staple Singers
The cops told me to turn it down
They like my shoes from Buster Brown
I went up the block an bought some incense
For the bone smells in the air conditioner vents
Hey kid need twenty cents havin a cook-out with my neighbor
How ya like the meat flavor mmmm

Ya shell shocked, cuts a rock mad ?blood? vulcan like Spock
Pull ya ribs out suck ya own cock
Block twenty-five knots laid up outta luck
Cut ya ass open stuff ya like a duck what
?Attraction? recarnation in a slump twenty-five cents
And a german dick pumped up
Shoulda known the killa from the jump junk
In veins impedes the brain hijackin planes
Pull a kotex out of Louis Lane
Explain the sky rain
Cadillacs and dead bitches consort with witches
Twenty-five sistas pussies with blisters we burn'em in rivers
Saviors of pimps and concubines
Have you ever asked yourself will you fuck Marilyn Manson
Or become Charlie Manson
Death Wish, I become Charles Bronson
Take your testicles and your dick for ransom
In a tea jar right next to the cookie jar
With nose and tits smoking a cigar

Asshole broken manics in a cave spandex columbo smokin
Panties in liquid pinesol soakin

Attached with a pick ass out dick out

450,Nothing But A Heartache,"It wasn't nothing but a heartache
In the middle of a bad dream
Like I took on the whole world
And I never had a chance, girl
Was a one-way conversation
I never got the invitation
The sharpness of her words deceiving
And I couldn't stop the bleeding
And Lord, I tried to be forgiving
But getting by don't mean you're living
And on that highway going nowhere
Was an exit overdue
And all she had to give was heartache
So she broke my heart in two
Yes, she did
You found me drifting in a small boat
In the middle of an ocean
You were there on my horizon
And I didn't have a notion
Unprepared to comprehend it
Felt alone and unattended
Said my prayers and reached my hand out
And you appeared to me that day
Came and led me to a new shore
I had never been there before
Put me in the right direction
And you led me out of Hell
And if it wasn't for your good heart
I'd have never broke her spell
'Cause you promised me tomorrow
But I learned that lesson well
Yes, I did. Oh yes, I did
You're the sum of all my heartbeats
You're the only truth my heart needs
Showed me how to make the journey
I can't let you walk away, no, not today
'Cause I've already slept with heartache
Time to chase the night away

And does forever sound okay?

Say, ""Yes, it does""

As though you were a man possessed
From deep inside comes rushing forth
All the anguish you suppressed
Up on your wall hangs your degree
Your parents craved so much for you
And though you're trained to make your mark
You still don't quite know what to do

It's never too late to start all over again
To love the people you caused the pain
And help them learn your name
Oh, no, not too late
It's never too late to start all over again

Well, it's much too late to start again
To try and find a little bliss
So on your woman and your child
You release your bitterness
You drift apart some more each day
You feel the guilt and loneliness
And the God of your childhood you can't find
To save you from your emptiness

It's never too late to start all over again
To love the people you caused the pain
And help them learn your name
Oh, no, not too late
It's never too late to start all over again

You say you've only got one life to live
And when you're dead you're gone
Your family comes to your grave
And with tears in their eyes
They tell you, you did something wrong
""You left us alone""

Tell me who's to say after all is done
And you're finally gone, you won't be back again
You can find a way to change today
You don't have to wait 'til then

It's never too late to start all over again (it's never too late)

With a love big as the sky

He couldn't swim the raging river 'cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach the Little White Dove waiting there on the other side
In the moonlight he could see her throwing kisses 'cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster waiting for her Indian brave
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die
Running Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down
Now they'll always be together in their happy hunting ground

461,Buying A Book,"Socrates famously said that he didn’t write his teachings down, because words on a page can’t answer back. Now they can.

*	*	*

Before the first term of my degree (English), we got the standard pile of reading to do. Over the summer, I struggled through Ulysses with the help of an excellent guide book, but that took a month. Next up: Bleak House. Then Middlemarch. You get the idea. We then moved on to poetry, and the starting point was, as I imagine it is for many, T. S. Eliot. I’d come across The Waste Land before but didn’t really understand what he was trying to do, but looking at the slim Collected Poems, I thought: I can do this in a week. No bother.

I was wrong. Obviously. Eliot is a densely allusive writer, but the allusions are the plasma of his poetry; he wants to send the reader on wild-goose paper trails. I had the humble ‘Student’s Guide’ to the poems, but this would only give me the reference itself, not its context, nor any clue to its significance. Again, I struggled through.

That week, if we had finished with Eliot (something we wouldn’t be), we were given some poems by Ezra Pound as optional reading. I looked at one of them, just out of curiosity. ‘Near Perigord’ was the title. I was immediately intrigued that a poem would be titled as just being ‘near’ a place, so I read on. What on earth was this epigraph, in a language that looked kind of like French and kind of like Latin, but was clearly neither? Who was ‘Cino’? Where the hell was this poem set, with all of these freely adapted place names? I gave up.

*	*	*

I came to Rap Genius as I was looking for some explanations of Wu-Tang lyrics. Explanations, not lyrics-- I already knew those. I was bowled over by the power of delivery, the different flows and styles employed by nine emcees, the darkness of the beats, etc., but I knew there were references and meanings flying over my head. With each song’s Rap Genius page in my browser, I could sit and click on every reference I didn’t get, or piece of slang I couldn’t deduce. It was a revelation in the way I listened to music.

Of course, now, Rap Genius has expanded its parameters beyond rap music-- it’s now on a mission to annotate all text. An overreaching claim, maybe, but it’s resulted in such diverse sites as Rock Genius, News Genius and Poetry Genius. The reader can now look at ‘Near Perigord’ and have all of that mental stuff explained in a click. The epigraph’s language and translation? Done. Possible identities for Cino? Done. The poem’s context/setting? Explained.

With this website, information is proliferated. Proliferated big time. Rap Genius, like rap music, takes power away from the establishment and gives it to the people. In the bad old days, if you wanted any kind of serious knowledge, you had to pay for it: buying a book, enrolling in higher education, whatever. The internet dropped a bomb on all of that, but the content and information there is sprawling and incoherent. The architecture of the Rap Genius website, the beauty of its coding, its accessibility and reach, finally look like solving this problem. Rap Genius focusses the dizzying amount of information on the internet into a laser of truth.

This is what, I think, gives some weight to the plan to be the biggest site on the web. A search gives you a website that’s been, okay, extremely well chosen according to what you’ve typed into the search bar. Rap Genius gives you annotations on the precise text you’re looking at, to the freakin’ word. No other internet service, or ‘service’ full stop, can provide that.

BUT.

There’s something even bigger than this. Yup, bigger than bigger than the internet. Rap Genius allows you to almost instantly absorb the context and references of any text. There is no paper trail of dictionaries, concordances, internet searches, which take precious time. You understand the text near-instantaneously. Imagine the implications of this-- the connexions we can make unburdened by the librarian-work of trudging through secondary material. We can leap, from, say, a passage in Virgil’s Aeneid, to golden-era hip hop, to contemporary performance poetry. And that’s just my non-Geniusified mind freestyling. Imagine what connexions newer, younger minds who have Genius-level knowledge as standard can make. We’re talking the cross-pollination of all creative expression and hard knowledge. That’s a genuine possibility with a site like Rap Genius. That’s what makes the project so thrilling to be a part of. If you wanna join in, just annotate a line.",Stephen Pringle,1969,"[58, 47, 48, 48, 53, 55, 67, 78]",8

464,Never Gonna Let Him Know,"[Verse 1]
My grand-pops was a man of respect, had to sweat
Just to cash checks working from sunrise to set
Every day he'd get challenged, no trades or talents
Barely scraped by, he found faith to balance
The straight line and pace, feeling worn and gray
Poor with four seeds, one more on the way
It was hard days indeed, all work and no play
He made sure things on the surface were okay, but
Something disturbin' within his mind was lurkin'
A slight twilight breeze would ease in through the curtains at night
It's like the sermon of a twisted apparition
Was urging him to listen to the train in the distance
At first it wasn't intense, just one little instance
Sure it didn't occur, he turned to resist it
As if it wasn't much more than just a figment
Of his imagination, but for days it was persistent
And it went;
""Follow me, follow me. Follow me, follow me""
Then it got louder
""Follow me, follow me. I have something to show you""

[Verse 2]
With time people noticed he was actin' berserk
Granny got a call saying he was absent from work
And that was a first
She ran to the pastor at church
To ask him what was up with this disastrous curse
But bad went to worse
He came back three days after
No money in his wallet and his shirt on backwards
Stumbling, walked awkward, he called out for his daughter
Right before he split the last lesson he taught her was this;
""If you ever have a son, let him know
That his granddad loves him, but by the time that he's grown
Be sure this seed is sown deep down into his dome;
Don't ever, ever walk to the train tracks alone""
With that, he backed up, reached out for his jacket
Told her not to act up and cracked up laughin'
After all that happened, he left, never to be seen
Fifteen years later is when my mother had me
Her dad lived a life people can't understand
Went from a family man to rambling man
A gambling man that burned both ends of the candle
Folded his hand in, it was too hot to handle

[Chorus]
Sitting on the tracks waiting for the night train
Looking down the road, ain't never gonna go back
Listen for the whistle through the wind and raindrop
Who's gonna ride the devil's train tonight?
Sitting on the tracks waiting for the night train
Looking down the road, ain't never gonna go back
Listen for the whistle through the wind and raindrop
Who's gonna ride the devil's train tonight?

[Verse 3]
When I was a tot, my mom dropped fables and stories
To warn me of the dangers that were layin' before me
To keep it interestin' she would hide the lesson
To guide my direction, provide the right message
In time I developed a sense of her embellishment
Since I was rebellious against what she was tellin' me
When I was a teen I pretended that my demons were friends
I defended the place, yo, and that was the case
Slurred speech drippin' off of my face
The world creeped as I slipped to the awfulest place you could imagine
Not the average things you see on acid
My granddad bloody, hovering on a speaker cabinet
Laughing in a raspy tone, covered in maggots
That snacked on his mass to the bone, I couldn't grasp it
Did a double dismount off of the couch, flipped out
Broke the closest window I found, then I dipped out
Suddenly, I discovered little voices mumbling up in my head
It had me wondering what was it my mother said
Back when I was younger, it had my brain wracked
As I stumbled off in the night towards the train tracks

[Chorus]
Sitting on the tracks waiting for the night train
Looking down the road, ain't never gonna go back
Listen for the whistle through the wind and raindrop
Who's gonna ride the devil's train tonight?
Sitting on the tracks waiting for the night train
Looking down the road, ain't never gonna go back
Listen for the whistle through the wind and raindrop
Who's gonna ride the devil's train tonight?

[Verse 4]
So there I was, stalking through the dark with a buzz
I figured I should walk, that'll ease me off of these drugs
It's like a shark, had to keep movin', it's that or be ruined;
If I sat still I was doomed, and that wasn't doin'
So I marched through the park slow, gone like Donnie Darko
The sparkle of the starlight glowed like charcoal
Despite my demeanor, the night seemed more serene
Than a morphine fiend in a morgue, it seemed like I'd lost it
That was when my grand-pops' carcass emerged from the dark
Gurgling his words of carnage, but he couldn't talk
Something about the birth of sadness
I scurried off; I was on the verge of madness
I raced, fast-paced, and the landscape was strange
Like a plane parallel to this one but rearranged
Came to a slope that was steep, beggin' for sleep
As I climbed up, taking my focus off of the creeps
Within the foggy distance, I saw a silhouette that got bigger as I stepped
The train tracks were wet
I saw a shiny grin from afar like it was happy
This is what he said as he started to walk past me:

""It's a nice night for a walk, would ya mind if I joined you?""

""Do what you wanna do""

""Well that's great, 'cause I'm going to
And not to annoy you but, see, I really have to ask
What a young dude like you's doin' out by the tracks?
You waitin' on a train?""

""Nah, man, let me explain""

""Alright""

""I'm mindin' my business so maybe you should do the same
I just been a witness to something sick and sadistic
So twistedly disgusting you should feel real lucky you missed it""

""Ooh, but easy with the tongue, son, try to listen carefully
What you've seen's scary, but nothing when compared to me
I could show you things to paint all your dreams haunted
I could make you scream if I wanted
Or I can be the bee in your bonnet, your best friend forever
Two peas in a pod flockin' like birds of a feather
And you never have a need to beg, work, or steal
If all this sounds worth it then let's make a deal
All you want in life for price of your soul
All the money you can fold, power that you can hold
I'll put you in control
Only if you're down to roll down these train tracks tonight""

""But where we gonna go?""

[Chorus]
Sitting on the tracks waiting for the night train
Looking down the road, ain't never gonna go back
Listen for the whistle through the wind and raindrop
Who's gonna ride the devil's train tonight?

They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed

Gone are the tears I used to cry
Cause we've got H-o-n-e-y

Sugar and spice sometimes
Each kiss adds a little sugar
Just a pinch of spice

The very day we tie that knot
Ice cream soda, ginger ale pop
Hey, it's sweet as honey, honey
Honey, honey, honey

We'll take a little sunshine, one loving cup
Just a little sunshine and you brighten up
We'll have sweet tomorrows
Cause with love and tender care

We'll build a sweet cottage for two
With all the tenderness love can do

477,Marley Purt Drive,"Sunday morning, woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

That's how they are, so I grabbed out the car, convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway, tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters, I wasn't feeling any more alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

I used to be a minstrel free
With a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real, but the good Lord threw me a snag
Now I'm gonna be the same as me, no matter how I try
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

Turned 'round the car and headed for home
I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more, I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

Sunday morning woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive

478,Gentle On My Mind,"It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowing I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that are dried upon some line
That keeps you on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a roughnin' coal pile, and
A dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waiting from the backroads
By the rivers of my memories
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind
Gentle on my mind
You are gentle on my mind",The Band Perry,1969,"[76, 76, 77]",3
479,I Want To Love You Baby,"I don't want you to be no slave
I don't want you to work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you

I don't want you to wash my clothes
I don't want you to keep my home
I don't want your money too
I just want to make a little love to you

Well I can see by the way that you switch and walk
And I can tell by the way that you baby talk
And I know by the way that you treat your man
I wanna love you baby, it's a cryin' shame

I don't want you to bake my bread
I don't want you to make my bed
I don't want you cause I'm sad and blue
I just want to make love to you

Rock me baby, rock me all night long
Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long
I want you to rock me baby, like my back ain't got no bone

Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel
Want you to roll me baby, you don't know how it makes me feel

Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow
Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow
Want you to rock me baby, till I want no more",Isaac Hayes,1969,"[81, 82, 82, 100]",4
480,Sunday,"[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

[Chorus: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck

[Outro: Both]
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes

You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes",Earl Sweatshirt,1969,"[90, 92, 92]",3

You know my wife she's a nurse, y'all
She go to work every night at a quarter to ten
She said, ""Mask, I don't want you hanging over at Bill's apartment
You better be home when I come in.""

Then my dog sat down and grinned his teeth
And then my cat lay down by the door
She said, ""If you don't dig what soul mother said
You ain't gonna be sleeping around here no more.""

""Well what are you doing shaking like that?""
I'm scared of my wife, my dog, and my cat
""I said what are you doing shaking like that?""
I told you I was scared of my wife, my dog, and my cat
I'm too good to them three for them to treat me like that
""What are you gonna do about it then?""
I'm gonna put on my [?]
My fifty dollar shoes
My crazy hat
I know they like it like that

And then I spit out in the hall
I heard ol' Bill call
He said, ""Come on over, Mask, we really having a ball
You ain't got a thing to lose, we got a table full of booze
And all kinda food.""
Then I slid on down the hall with a smile on my face
There was pretty girls sitting all over the place

""Were they fat?""
Fat as a country possum stuffed with sweet potatos
""I want to know, Were they fat?""
I told you they was fat as a country possum stuffed with sweet potatos
With their miniskirts on and their crazy sweaters
It took me two hours to get myself together

""You know your wife done told you about them young girls, old big-eyed Rover.""
You know my wife don't know some things like that will never hurt her

I want a sandwich
""What you want on it?""
I'll take a couple of those pigs feets over there
Two or three of those hot rolls
Some of them greens with that fatback in it
And some of that potato salad
And I'll try some of them chilli dogs if you don't mind

Lord, having a good time
Good god, yeah
Having a party
Having a party y'all

""What are they doing in there now?""

Man, they doing a dance
They call it Squeeze Your Knees, that's what they doing
Old Bill fell out on the floor, You know what he said?
He said, ""Lighten up on me baby, please.""
That's what he said

Then one looked in the corner
Said ""Mask, what's wrong with you?
There's a brand new dance, you can do it too
Then I got up in the fold, and got into my act
My old lady bust through the door
Then she touched me in the back
She had my German police dog with her
The one I raised from a pup
She sicked that monster on me, man
That was just too much
He tore off my crazy suit
And I run from under my hat
And when I slid out in my apartment door
I got [?] by the cat

""You better watch out
For your wife, your dog, and your cat.""

Sits a ragged tent
Where there ain't no trees

And when you'd almost bet
You could hear yourself sweat, he walks in
Eyes black as coal
And when he lifts his face
Ev'ry ear in the place is on him
Starting soft and slow
Like a small earthquake
And when he lets go
Half the valley shakes

I said, brothers
Now you got yourself two good hands
And when your brother is troubled, you gotta reach out your one hand for him
‘Cause that’s what it’s there for
And when your heart is troubled, you gotta reach out your other hand
Reach it out to the man up there
‘Cause that’s what He is there for

Walk with me this day
In my heart I know I will never stray

489,"In The Bad, Bad Old Days (Before You Loved Me)","The Eve of the Trial

        AN upper room in a dull Stoniton street, with two beds in it—one laid on the floor. It is ten o'clock on Thursday night, and the dark wall opposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled with the light of the one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is pretending to read, while he is really looking over his spectacles at Adam Bede, seated near the dark window.

        You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told. His face has got thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the neglected beard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead, and there is no active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off, that he may be more awake to what is around him. He has one arm over the back of the chair, and he seems to be looking down at his clasped hands. He is roused by a knock at the door.

        ""There he is,"" said Bartle Massey, rising hastily and unfastening the door. It was Mr. Irwine.

        Adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect, as Mr. Irwine approached him and took his hand.

        ""I'm late, Adam,"" he said, sitting down on the chair which Bartle placed for him, ""but I was later in setting off from Broxton than I intended to be, and I have been incessantly occupied since I arrived. I have done everything now, however—everything that can be done to-night, at least. Let us all sit down.""

        Adam took his chair again mechanically, and Bartle, for whom there was no chair remaining, sat on the bed in the background.

        ""Have you seen her, sir?"" said Adam tremulously.

        ""Yes, Adam; I and the chaplain have both been with her this evening.""

        ""Did you ask her, sir...did you say anything about me?""

        ""Yes,"" said Mr. Irwine, with some hesitation, ""I spoke of you. I said you wished to see her before the trial, if she consented.""

        As Mr. Irwine paused, Adam looked at him with eager, questioning eyes.

        ""You know she shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It is not only you—some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her fellow-creatures. She has scarcely said anything more than 'No' either to me or the chaplain. Three or four days ago, before you were mentioned to her, when I asked her if there was any one of her family whom she would like to see—to whom she could open her mind—she said, with a violent shudder, 'Tell them not to come near me—I won't see any of them.'""

        Adam's head was hanging down again, and he did not speak. There was silence for a few minutes, and then Mr. Irwine said, ""I don't like to advise you against your own feelings, Adam, if they now urge you strongly to go and see her to-morrow morning, even without her consent. It is just possible, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, that the interview might affect her favourably. But I grieve to say I have scarcely any hope of that. She didn't seem agitated when I mentioned your name; she only said 'No,' in the same cold, obstinate way as usual. And if the meeting had no good effect on her, it would be pure, useless suffering to you—severe suffering, I fear. She is very much changed...""

        Adam started up from his chair and seized his hat, which lay on the table. But he stood still then, and looked at Mr. Irwine, as if he had a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter. Bartle Massey rose quietly, turned the key in the door, and put it in his pocket.

        ""Is he come back?"" said Adam at last.

        ""No, he is not,"" said Mr. Irwine, quietly. ""Lay down your hat, Adam, unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air. I fear you have not been out again to-day.""

        ""You needn't deceive me, sir,"" said Adam, looking hard at Mr. Irwine and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion. ""You needn't be afraid of me. I only want justice. I want him to feel what she feels. It's his work...she was a child as it 'ud ha' gone t' anybody's heart to look at...I don't care what she's done...it was him brought her to it. And he shall know it...he shall feel it...if there's a just God, he shall feel what it is t' ha' brought a child like her to sin and misery.""

        ""I'm not deceiving you, Adam,"" said Mr. Irwine. ""Arthur Donnithorne is not come back—was not come back when I left. I have left a letter for him: he will know all as soon as he arrives.""

        ""But you don't mind about it,"" said Adam indignantly. ""You think it doesn't matter as she lies there in shame and misery, and he knows nothing about it—he suffers nothing.""

        ""Adam, he WILL know—he WILL suffer, long and bitterly. He has a heart and a conscience: I can't be entirely deceived in his character. I am convinced—I am sure he didn't fall under temptation without a struggle. He may be weak, but he is not callous, not coldly selfish. I am persuaded that this will be a shock of which he will feel the effects all his life. Why do you crave vengeance in this way? No amount of torture that you could inflict on him could benefit her.""

        ""No—O God, no,"" Adam groaned out, sinking on his chair again; ""but then, that's the deepest curse of all...that's what makes the blackness of it...IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE. My poor Hetty...she can never be my sweet Hetty again...the prettiest thing God had made—smiling up at me...I thought she loved me...and was good...""

        Adam's voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if he were only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at Mr. Irwine, ""But she isn't as guilty as they say? You don't think she is, sir? She can't ha' done it.""

        ""That perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,"" Mr. Irwine answered gently. ""In these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what seems to us strong evidence, and yet, for want of knowing some small fact, our judgment is wrong. But suppose the worst: you have no right to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him, and that he ought to bear the punishment. It is not for us men to apportion the shares of moral guilt and retribution. We find it impossible to avoid mistakes even in determining who has committed a single criminal act, and the problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen consequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble to look into it. The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act of selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to awaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You have a mind that can understand this fully, Adam, when you are calm. Don't suppose I can't enter into the anguish that drives you into this state of revengeful hatred. But think of this: if you were to obey your passion—for it IS passion, and you deceive yourself in calling it justice—it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur; nay, worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime.""

        ""No—not worse,"" said Adam, bitterly; ""I don't believe it's worse—I'd sooner do it—I'd sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself than ha' brought HER to do wickedness and then stand by and see 'em punish her while they let me alone; and all for a bit o' pleasure, as, if he'd had a man's heart in him, he'd ha' cut his hand off sooner than he'd ha' taken it. What if he didn't foresee what's happened? He foresaw enough; he'd no right to expect anything but harm and shame to her. And then he wanted to smooth it off wi' lies. No—there's plenty o' things folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that. Let a man do what he will, if he knows he's to bear the punishment himself, he isn't half so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t' himself and knows all the while the punishment 'll fall on somebody else.""

        ""There again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone; you can't isolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall not spread. Men's lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I know, I feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur's has caused to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows on every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add worse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of vengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such actions, and as long as you indulge it, as long as you do not see that to fix your mind on Arthur's punishment is revenge, and not justice, you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great wrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had given that blow to Arthur in the Grove.""

        Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the past, and Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle Massey about old Mr. Donnithorne's funeral and other matters of an indifferent kind. But at length Adam turned round and said, in a more subdued tone, ""I've not asked about 'em at th' Hall Farm, sir. Is Mr. Poyser coming?""

        ""He is come; he is in Stoniton to-night. But I could not advise him to see you, Adam. His own mind is in a very perturbed state, and it is best he should not see you till you are calmer.""

        ""Is Dinah Morris come to 'em, sir? Seth said they'd sent for her.""

        ""No. Mr. Poyser tells me she was not come when he left. They're afraid the letter has not reached her. It seems they had no exact address.""

        Adam sat ruminating a little while, and then said, ""I wonder if Dinah 'ud ha' gone to see her. But perhaps the Poysers would ha' been sorely against it, since they won't come nigh her themselves. But I think she would, for the Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons; and Seth said he thought she would. She'd a very tender way with her, Dinah had; I wonder if she could ha' done any good. You never saw her, sir, did you?""

        ""Yes, I did. I had a conversation with her—she pleased me a good deal. And now you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that a gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart. The jail chaplain is rather harsh in his manner.""

        ""But it's o' no use if she doesn't come,"" said Adam sadly.

        ""If I'd thought of it earlier, I would have taken some measures for finding her out,"" said Mr. Irwine, ""but it's too late now, I fear...Well, Adam, I must go now. Try to get some rest to-night. God bless you. I'll see you early to-morrow morning.""",George Eliot,1969,"[51, 52, 52, 58, 60, 64, 77]",7

Cats meowed to the break of day

My experience was limited and underfed
You were talking while I hid
To the one who was the father of your kid
You probably didn't think I did, but I heard
You say that love is just a four-letter word

I said goodbye unnoticed
Pushed forth into my own games
Drifting in and out of lifetimes
Unmentionable by name
Searching for my double, looking for
Complete evaporation to the core
Though I tried and failed at finding any door
I must have thought that there was nothing more
Absurd than that love is just a four-letter word

Though I never knew just what you meant
When you were speaking to your man
I can only think in terms of me
And now I understand
After waking enough times to think I see
The Holy Kiss that's supposed to last eternity
Blow up in smoke, it's destiny
Falls on strangers, travels free

Oh, but don't give in to him (don't give in to him)
No, don't give in to him (ah)
Cause he will only ask for more

Real talk word to mother it be the gutter brother (ah!)

Get it together, been bodyin shit since mommy named me Trevor
Stellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a
Reaction I attract all the people to come together
Whether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter
Just let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that
When I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in
Remember I'm too hot to touch kid
Curious, my fire burnin niggas serious
I gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is
See through motherfuckers, we'll never be equal
I'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)
I be the baddest see when I spit I become the maddest
And kill 'em until the blood'll (seep through)
Front if you want but you know who the top biller
Bounce while I'm killing the strut and walk with a bop, killer!

Rob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo

Of a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)
Turn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero
When my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)

[Verse 3: Spliff Star]
I'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon
My goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em
Dead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim
With fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em
Now I got pretty women all around the world
If I been in your city probably pound your girl
Had her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out
Send her back home set to fire the sex out

Flipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are
Used to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar
Eatin on supreme shit, at the round table
On some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge
I talk reckless, the whole world know
My style is C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW
So don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs
And come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids
Like, ""Shh, take off the watch""

And the board of health say the boy need help
I am so hot the AM just melt
All aboard, all aboard black card, no fraud
I'm an extension cord, I'm a lightning rod
I'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur
I'm a sinus minus the nose, I'm a cold
I'm raw than a temperature rose to five and
Two o's that's 500 degrees for those who know
My fire's higher than a liars
We don't burn rubber, we burn tires
We riders, residers, we live in The Carter
Wayne is a flame that could live in the water
Ok now let's get it straight, either you bait or the mate
Either way you on my plate gettin ate after grace
If you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner
I'm hotter in the winter, burn like sinners, turn like spinners
I swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture
Boy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man

[Verse 6: Nas]
Man, listen I spot a square dude from a distance
Through the tinted Maybach curtain in partition
Nip/Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em
Or pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em
Bring fire, frizzy hair for press-spire
You ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler
Crutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver
Keep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider
I ain't a rapper or an activist, I'm badder
I used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper
No black leather jackets or black berets
Since my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page
And none of y'all cop what I cop
Forget your excuse if the music ain't hot
Where the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes
See you on the club, wrist never on froze

Busta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through
This is routine kid it ain't nothin new
You bring trouble to me, the untouchable
Make me have to bring in the troops like George W
I'll scorch you somethin awful when I fall through
Of course the raw to be when you could put a broad to
Better bring with you your fire extinguisher
Listen, I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya (OK!)
Kid I made it from magazine pages to big stages
High wages through all of the different ages
Thinkin you do it like this is outrageous
Yeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous
Your hottest thing to me, not a thing
Every night my crib is like the Bada Bing
So make sure that you youngin's got it right

502,The Way It Used To Be,"This is the story of a man
Who took for granted everything he had
And how he let it all just slip away
Never to return again

Now twenty years have come and gone
And still he wonders what he did so wrong
And how that he can win back her heart
And finally step outside of the dark

He buys fresh roses everyday
Her favourite flower so she used to say
And now the memories all that he has left
And I'm afraid he'll drink himself to death

This is the story of a man
Who took for granted everything he had
And how he let it all just slip away
Never to return again

It's clear she's moved on long ago
But he still clings on to a distant hope
That she'll come back and make a happy home
For now it's him and the bottle all alone

Sometimes you'll see him in the yard
A wounded man with a desperate heart
He keeps the hedges trimmed nice and neat
To keep them the way that the used to be

This is the story of a man
Who took for granted everything he had
And how he let it all just slip away
Never to return again

A single dress hangs on its own
The scent of perfume all he has to hold
A wasted life waiting on a dream
Hoping for things the way they used to be

This is the story of a man (this is the story of a man)
Who took for granted everything he had (everything he had)
And how he let it all just slip away (he let it slip away)
Never to return again (to return again)",City and Colour,1969,"[55, 42, 42, 42, 43, 44, 60, 65, 77, 87, 100]",11

Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

505,Where Do You Go To (My Lovely),"You talk like Marlene Dietrich
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire
Your clothes are all made by Balmain
And there's diamonds and pearls in your hair, yes there are

You live in a fancy apartment
Off the Boulevard St. Michel
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records
And a friend of Sacha Distel, yes you do

You go to the embassy parties
Where you talk in Russian and Greek
And the young men who move in your circles
They hang on every word you speak, yes they do

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I've seen all your qualifications
You got from the Sorbonne
And the painting you stole from Picasso
Your loveliness goes on and on, yes it does

When you go on your summer vacation
You go to Juan-les-Pins
With your carefully designed topless swimsuit
You get an even suntan on your back, and on your legs

And when the snow falls you're found in St. Moritz
With the others of the jet set
And you sip your Napoleon brandy
But you never get your lips wet, no you don't

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Won't you tell me the thoughts that surround you?
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

You're in between twenty and thirty
That's a very desirable age
Your body is firm and inviting
But you live on a glittering stage, yes you do, yes you do

Your name is heard in high places
You know the Aga Khan
He sent you a race horse for Christmas
And you keep it just for fun, for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

They say that when you get married
It'll be to a millionaire
But they don't realize where you came from
And I wonder if they really care, or give a damn

But where do you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed?
Tell me the thoughts that surround you
I want to look inside your head, yes I do

I remember the back streets of Naples:
Two children begging in rags
Both touched with a burning ambition
To shake off their lowly-born tags, they tried

So look into my face, Marie-Claire
And remember just who you are
Then go and forget me forever
But I know you still bear the scar, deep inside

I know where you go to my lovely
When you're alone in your bed
I know the thoughts that surround you
Cause I can look inside your head",Peter Sarstedt,1969,"[70, 72, 73, 73, 74, 85]",6

514,First Of May,"[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning
I had a scone and a large house blend
Then a little conversation
With my squirrel and chipmunk friends
I said I'm sick and tired of winter
And I wish that it was spring
Then a little fella named Robin Redbreast began to sing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And he sang:
Ooh child, what you think, the cold winter's gonna last forever?
Ooh child, now's the time for all the people to get together
Outside

[Chorus]
Cause it's the First of May
First of May
Outdoor fucking starts today
So bring your favorite lady
Or at least your favorite lay
Water's not cold, baby, dip in your big toe
Maybe I'll see you in flagrante delicto
Grass below you, sky above
Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called
Fucking outside

[Verse 2]
I thanked him for the information
I cried a little when he flew away
Watched an episode of ""The People's Court""
And I tried to plan my day
Called up my old lady
She wasn't home so I called my girl
Asked her if she'd like to join me as I entertain the world

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I said:
Ooh child, I'll bring a blanket and I promise I will brush the ants off
Ooh child, you're gonna like it when we're taking each other's pants off
Outside

Cause it's the First of May
First of May

Celebrate spring with a crazy little thing called
Fucking outside

[Verse 3]
So we went to the park together
We were walking in the midday sun
Met all kinds of people
And we fucked everyone
Fucked a lady who sells ice cream
Fucked a man with a tan shar pei
Everyone who needed fucking, well
They got fucked today

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So come on
Ooh child, open your mind and your heart, feel the spirit moving through you
Ooh child, you'll feel the warmth of the love when I stick it to you

Alas, my love, you do me wrong

Greensleeves was my delight
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
And who but my lady greensleeves

Your vows you've broken, like my heart
Oh, why did you so enrapture me?

But my heart remains in captivity

I have been ready at your hand
To grant whatever you would crave
I have both wagered life and land
Your love and good-will for to have

If you intend thus to disdain
It does the more enrapture me
And even so, I still remain
A lover in captivity

My men were clothed all in green
And they did ever wait on thee;
All this was gallant to be seen
And yet thou wouldst not love me

Thou couldst desire no earthly thing
But still thou hadst it readily
Thy music still to play and sing;
And yet thou wouldst not love me

Well, I will pray to God on high
That thou my constancy mayst see
And that yet once before I die
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me

526,From Both Sides Now,"Bows and flows of angel hair
An ice cream castle's in the air
Feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain their snow on everyone
So many things I would've done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's clouds' illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

The moon and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
When every fairytale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let 'em know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, still, somehow it's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears, fears feeling doubt
To say I love right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all",Dion,1969,"[91, 91]",2

Think about this love of ours
A million to one, they say that our love

They're betting everything
That our love, won't survive
They're hoping in time
We'll forget each other's lives

A million to one, they say that
We're too young to know the meaning of love
A million to one, that they've forgotten
The dreams that we're dreaming of

But we'll forgive them because we love them
After all, that's said and done
There's one in a million, a million to one

A million to one, they say that
We're too young to know the meaning of love
A million to one, that they've forgotten

528,Traces,"Silence is the noise I hear from the world that speaks my name
Infusing my head with a promise of nothing
The meaningless now resonates and reverberates
Flooding through the sleeper's veins, I never dreamed
Lost in Reflection with this obsession to blame
I walk the fine line between forward and rewind

I have foreseen this most vicious storm to come
It will be speechless, it will be violent
Words are buried in the sounds of night
Continue with your ignorance, and bring this silence with you until the end

Empty shells whispering quietly
They speak to me of a common past
Teaching me how to become insane
To silence the ambivalence that's in my head
It is the only possible way to avoid the shame
Reminding me that I must suffer through
Reminding me that I must persist

Erasing the traces that you'll never find
I hope that you all can forgive me now
I am facing the fact that I'm up against fate
So I put it all on the line, soon it's time

This time what I leave behind is my legacy
I will force my mark upon everyone
The traces I leave, they will speak my name
Day after day, reminding myself that my motive will overcome the consequences
I won't let repentance prevent my way
I will leave you behind with no regrets

Time passes through me in the shape of a dream
Clawing ferociously through my memories

Erasing the traces that you'll never find
I hope that you all can forgive me now
I am facing the fact that I am up against fate
So I put it all on the line, soon it's time

The clouds are getting darker and the winds are colder now

Then I'll try something new

I will take you away with me as far as I can
To Venus or Mars
There we will love with your hand in my hand
You'll be queen of the stars
And every day we can play on the Milky Way
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

[Verse 3]
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea
To wear in your hair
I'll do anything and everything to keep you happy
To show you that I care
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas
And if that don't do
Then I'll try something new

I can see your smile, it's what gets me through my hard days
And your words were supposed to get me
Through my heartache, before my heartbreak

And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal

Maybe I just couldn't cure you

Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage

And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide

And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
Instead you duck for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof

American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace ""HIS GIRL FRIDAY"" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –

YOUNG WOMAN
– but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: ""We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er.""

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
""Empty out the register,"" and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
""Garcon"" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?

""PULP FICTION""

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) – MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas – one white, one black – both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
– Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man – I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) – MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD – MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING) – MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR – MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: ""Yes.""

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: ""Yes.""

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses – nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
– no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages – I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment – he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage –
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed – this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered ""49."" They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49) – MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a ""Flock of
Seagulls"" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: ""No.""

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: ""Yes.""

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be –

JULES
– I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions –

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about ""best
intentions.""

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
""What"" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in ""What?""

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say ""What"" again! C'mon, say ""What""
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say ""What"" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black –

JULES
– go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald –

JULES
– does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you.""

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

""VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE""

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT – BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find – when all
this shit is over and done – I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
""Marsellus Wallace was right.""

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of ""Plain ol' American.""

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) – NIGHT

CLOSEUP – JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM – NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
""Speed Racer"" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce – those are friend
prices – but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the ""faux pas.""

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days – five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP – THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP – BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP – NOTE

The Note reads:

""Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink.  Mia""

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing ""SON OF A
PREACHER MAN"".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA
(over intercom)
Vincent. I'm on the intercom.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
It's on the wall by the two African
fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
To your right.

Vincent walks.

MIA
...warm. Warmer. Disco.

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

VINCENT
Hello.

MIA
(over intercom)
Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Hello.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(into microphone)
Go make yourself a drink., and I'll
be down in two shakes of a lamb's
tail.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

MIA
(over intercom)
The bar's by the fireplace.

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM – NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM – NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an ""Archie"" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: ""Next best thing to a time machine.""

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S – NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

(""ROCK ALL NIGHT,"" ""HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,"" ""ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER,"" and ""MACHINE GUN KELLY""). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, ""No shoes allowed."" Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: ""Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me.""

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger –
bloody – and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him –

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it –

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called ""Fox Force Five.""

VINCENT
What?

MIA
""Fox Force Five."" Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) – NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) – NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS –

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: ""Yes.""

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once – at my wedding
– then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's ""YOU NEVER CAN TELL"".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP – MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say ""Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening,"" go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
OH Jesus Christ!
Jesus Fuckin Christ
Oh Fuck me

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

Vincent

Answer
FUCK YOU LANCE ANSWER!

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, ""TAFT,
CALIFORNIA"", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it –
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.
prank caller, PRANK CALLER!

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone –

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
""Come on,"" endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room –

VINCENT (O.S.)
– get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like ""The
Shape"" killing its victims in ""HALLOWEEN"".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like –
(snaps his fingers)
– that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest – SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING) – NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE – NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE
FIVE"" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him –
(stamps on the ground)
– and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP – VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon ""SPEED RACER.""  Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
""The Mac-5,"" which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: ""BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE"".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

""THE GOLD WATCH""

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
– Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING) – NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) – NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the –

CLICK – Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) – NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) – NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table –
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) – NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio – you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos – is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean ""Esmarelda of the wolves.""

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man –

BUTCH
– I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: ""yes.""

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) – NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news – I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) – NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) – NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did ""Lucky Star,"" it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: ""no.""

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: ""yes.""

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM – MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film ""THE LOSERS"".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese –

BUTCH
– where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
–

BUTCH
– on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) – DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. ""Bedside table – on the
kangaroo."" I said the words: ""Don't
forget my father's watch.""

EXT. CITY STREET – DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY – DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name ""Teriyaki Donut"" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of ""Ring Magazine"" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
""MODESTY BLAISE"" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA – DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA – DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: ""Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?""

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER #1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER #2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER #2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads ""MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP"".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
–

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me –

MAYNARD (O.S.)
– hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business –

MAYNARD
– I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent ""Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... "" just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT – BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: ""yes."" Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon ""DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER"" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask – two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name ""GRACE"" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM – DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a ""Frankie says,
Relax"" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET – CHOPPER (MOVING) – DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named ""GRACE.""
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM – DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good –

BUTCH
– did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk –
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

""JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF""

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men...""

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM – DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
""...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you.""

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT – DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, ""Are we hit?"" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand –

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING – MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING) – MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show ""COPS?""  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules –

JULES
– I said don't do that –

VINCENT
– you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
Aww man, I shot Marvin in the face

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time –

VINCENT
– chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight –

VINCENT
– I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM – DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell I'm not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN – MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, ""Dead nigger storage?""

Jules starts to ""Jimmie"" him –

JIMMIE
– answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, ""Dead nigger storage?""

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to ""Jimmie"" him.

JIMMIE
– I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation –
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie –

JIMMIE
– don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM – MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the ""ifs.""

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' ""ifs.""What I wanna
hear from your ass is: ""you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly.""

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE – MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka ""THE WOLF"". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

""1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)""

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

""Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)""

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

""NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER""

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET – MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE – MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100%.

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN – MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery – now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie –
lead the way, boys – get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A ""please"" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a ""please"" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say ""please.""I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM – MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin' –

THE WOLF
– Winston, Jimmie – please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore –

THE WOLF
– let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE – MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm ""SUPERFLY T.N.T,"" I'm the ""GUNS
OF NAVARONE."" I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA – MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD – MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE – MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless –

THE WOLF
– unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW – MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do ""I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE,"" you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
""DEAD ZONE"" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in ""KUNG FU.""
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent – no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be – a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ –

VINCENT
– what happened was peculiar – no
doubt about it – but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all –

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM – MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his ""MODESTY BLAISE"" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: ""yes.""

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: ""yes.""

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and – sure enough – there's a wallet
with ""Bad Motherfucker"" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. ""The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you."" I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
– wearing UC Santa Cruz and ""I'm with Stupid"" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

Masked up, this ain't trick or treat, one wrong move they finna squeeze
We ain't come for peace, you can bend your knees and pray all day
They waiting on me to give an a-okay, then the K gon' spray
But today's your day, I'mma let you live, I'mma let you pay
Back everything you ever said to me so start with the thing that you said to me
I was worthless, I'd never make it, go ahead! Spill that hatred
You are now face to face with a thorough pharaoh who be down on Death Row
You says to me but I'll let you, now let go
Chevy filled up on Petrol, times like this I just roll

And that purple that I got got me on slur with all my words
Thats my word, thats my boy too, yall dont really know what Ive gone through
Now me, Stalley, and Meek wanna see Ross get the A-Rod loot
Big play, hot juice, Drama called and you're Carl Lewis
My opponents so obtuse, even if they alone they not top two
I'm in Ohio watching Kyrie and Samardo hoopin'
Work loud, chokin', all your reefer, it's soft spoken

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

[Chorus]
Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Well, I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home

549,Tracks Of My Tears,"People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Well, although I may be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

So take a good look at my face
You'll see then my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you, need you

Since you left
If you see me with someone else
Acting like I'm having big fun
Well, although he may look fine
He's not a really man
You're the only one

So take a good look at my face
You'll see then my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I'm masquerading
My hope is fading
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up
With you

Baby, take just a
One good look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's so easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Oh baby, take just
One look at my face
You'll see that my
Smile is out of place
And if you look closer
It's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
O-o-o-o-oh oh o-o-oh oh oh o-o-oh

Oh, look at my face
You'll see that my smile
Seems out of place
And if you look closer...",Aretha Franklin,1969,"[82, 71, 71, 80, 91, 91]",6
550,Breakfast In Bed,"[Verse 1]
Couldn't sleep last night
Waking up in cold sweats, reading your last line
Now it's six in the morning
And I'm staring at the side of the bed that you're not in
I wonder where you're waking
Wonder if you're all alone
Don't you wish you could just be right here
Waking up where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

[Chorus]
So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to take this to another level
Get you high off my intensity
I just want to take you home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 2]
Why you makin' me beg?
You ain't gotta do me like that, boy it ain't fair
I been trying my hardest
Last week you was on it and you wouldn't stop calling
I know what you're thinking
Don't want to make it serious
But we don't need a title for what we got here
And the rest is up to us

[Pre-Chorus]
Why you playin' hard to get?
Never had to wait this long before
Never been the type to fight for more
Waking up with no regrets
Isn't that what we do this for?
Isn't that what we do this for?

So let me take you to my room, I'll give you what you need
I just want to take you home with me

You home with me
I just want to give you that breakfast in bed
Take you home with me
I just want to get you home with me (breakfast in bed)
I just want to give you that, I just want to give you that

[Verse 3]
On a silver platter when you wake up
High into my realm I wanna take ya
Got a lot of tricks, let me break you off
You know what time it is when I take it off
Boy you know I got a lot to offer, I ain't never gonna stop you when you wanna come get it
Just know I keep it real tight so you can stay for the night wake up, breakfast in bed

551,There Never Was A Time,"There was a time
We'd sit in the backyard 'cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun
There was no way of sleeping
And you'd play your old guitar
We'd fight mosquitos and enjoy

You backyard concerts for we had no television
We'd just begun our life
As man and wife and hardships then
Could scarcely scare us into quitting

Things were far from being fine
We often dined upon a dime
But there never was a time we didn't love

And that Christmas brought our saddest days
When your pride gave way when you told the kids
There'd be no gifts cause we were broke
Though their little tears of grief were so hard to see
It didn't hurt me

Like the lump I knew was in your throat
It was then with arms entwined
We both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever come
The doctor bills we couldn't pay
They came and took our car away
But there never was a time we didn't love

Now there's an easy chair for my back
A satin pillow for my head
And the kids are wild about the brand new car
You and I can order steak with all the trimmings and not worry

If we've spent a dollar more than we can spare
No wonder in our prayers
We've thanked the man upstairs who led us through
The years of raising kids and paying bills

And I think he guided us
Not because we were smart but just because
There never was a time we didn't love
No there never was a time never was a time
There never was a time we didn't love",Jeannie C. Riley,1969,"[93, 77, 78, 86]",4
552,It's A Groovy World!,"This is a groovy world we live in
And everybody must know
People are gonna be people
No matter where you go
So forget the black, the white, the rich, the poor
The right and the wrong
Let everybody be everybody
So we can all get along
You don't have to try to force me
To dig my fellow man
Let me do my thing
You do yours
Things will be just fair
There's so much mistrust enough
Not to do each other wrong
So let's concentrate on getting rid of hate
So that we can make it a groovy world

Can't teach an old dog new tricks
So the saying goes
The old folks don't understand you youngsters
And they claim you just ain't grown
But if we took the time to explain
And give old folks a chance
You might be surprised
They might change their mind
And begin to understand

To each his own and know thyself
Another saying goes
Different strokes, different folks
Is the one you probably know
Don't ever take a trip to be hip
To feel what life can be
I can dig here, you can dig me
The world will be such a groovy place to be

Seems its up to you and me
To hold this world together
Pool our resources
Collect our cool
To help make things better
Claim today we're tomorrow leaders
So why don't we all take heed
Set and example for the world to follow
To know just what it needs

See a flower child walking hand-in-hand
With a military man
And know that peace instead of war
Prevails in our land
To know today that people made
From all across the globe
Join hands brother like we should
Let's make it a groovy world",Unifics,1969,"[97, 98]",2
553,I Can't Do Enough,"[Verse]
Switch blade rhetoric cutting right through his letterman
I let ‘em hemorrhage and sent my sentiments
I’m in my element, your time's up, take a look at the pendulum
I arrive where you reside war ready on Pegasus
Complementary smoke for everybody I’m so generous
Bitch I’m from New York, conceit is in my geneticis
Genocide to the pessimists
It’s really no objection I’m objectively the nicest by any means of measurement
I’m intrepid i don’t feel the slightest bit of threatened
Slightest bit impressed, I let the bullet fly and hit your engine
High and in suspension eye the prize till it’s in my possession
I ain’t taking questions or suggestions, i don’t need assessing
I ain’t with pretending to be friends with all these lames for leverage
Pay respects, or pay a major debt and fade away in seconds
Aim for necks I came to play no games, I'm not a name to mention
Take his head then stand over the carcass with a blank expression
Man this shit is all just a breeze
These rap niggas ain’t gon ever have a thing over me
How y’all gon have the conscious rapper out here dripping with ease
That’s all y’all got going for you and you barely compete
For real nigga please, arm and leg to kill niggas beats
Y’all gon need to take out a loan to get a verse out of me
Hop in the booth, unload and reload it, rinse and repeat
Then charge him more to promote you don’t compare or compete, kapeesh
But if he try to provoke then imma scope ‘em out
Smoke ‘em out, soak his clothes in rose red, expose a clown
Focused on the gold, while these hoes in they emotions, brown
Nosing for the clout, going south with an open mouth
I’m the coldest out I control the game and own it now
Golden child, gold around my neck, I know you know my style
Going in loud, I’ll dethrone whoever owns the crown
Crack his head open, I expose his frontal lobe then I’m out
Man y’all niggas all saps
Y’all niggas don’t kill, don’t bang, don’t trap
Don’t send me no bars knowing that you can’t rap
Don’t send me no beats knowing that they don’t slap
Kurt’s back, stepping up to bat, it’s a whole wrap
I don’t spar, i don’t play fight, i don’t throw jabs
Fall back ‘fore i put a hole through your bros cap
No cap, tell ‘em hang it up like phone’s tapped
Woah, back up in the bitch with gang tight
We done came on the scene with fucking choppers and hang glides
Bodies on top of bodies surface all on the bay side
We can turn this Normandy, these shores to a grave sight
Man it’s a grave sight, we out for blood like great whites
Y’all are fresh out of luck y’all oughta stay on the safe side
Came to shake the game up and the world at the same time
So basically he came to shake sphere like the play write shit. ",Kurt Hazard,1969,"[98, 99]",2

555,Things I'd Like To Say,"Baby, is he looking after you?
Is he showing you the same love, the warm love
Just like we knew?

Baby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of
In the morning when I wake up
In the evening, it's you that I dream of

Sometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind
And sometimes you might feel blue
But remember now, darling, if his words are real
This will never, never happen to you

Baby, baby, there's things I'd like to say
I was hoping that with our love
We would get married someday

Baby, baby, it's you I'm thinking of
In the morning when I wake up
In the evening, it's you that I dream of

Sometimes love hurts, and sometimes love's unkind

As far as that girl can see
The earth that I walk upon is heavenly
Blessed is the love I bring to her
And knowing what it means to her
In the eyes of that girl
I am everything to her
But what happens
When the statue on the pedestal
Comes crumbling to the ground
I don't wanna be around
To see the sorrow on her face
When she thinks I let her down
And what happens
When she finds the world is real
And not the fairyland she thinks it is
That I'm a man who lives and breathes
And makes mistakes and not a
Superman she dreamed
Blessed is the strength she finds in me
And the weakness she'll never see
I'll go before the image falls apart
And blessed is the way I'll always
Stay in her heart
Oh, blessed is the way I'll always
Stay in her heart",Brooklyn Bridge,1969,"[55, 45, 49, 54, 61, 67]",6
557,When He Touches Me (Nothing Else Matters),"[Verse 1: Champtown]
Get your rusty ass over 'fore I put a shine to it
See man, it's man I trust so I'mma rhyme to it
20% out of a hundred groups are mediocre
They took a medicine effect and I'm a pretty choker
So once you got a couple microphones well I'mma rep 'em
You got some Nile rapper rivers too, well I'mma check 'em!
Because they new to this, I'm true to this!
They shouldn't be doin' this
A lot of rappers reppin' keepin' miles is a few in this
Game, to maintain, I keep it going on
You hear the guitar and the funky beat I'm flowin' on
I don't tell 'em when I see it, I just spot it
Just runnin' me, have soul and ain't the only person got it
And blacks don't have to act white if they like Red Hot Chili Peppers
And whites dont have to act black if they like Salt-n-pepa
Cause I like a lot of people [?] mucus on the [?]
So I'm Blackened like Metallica, look at me in shock
But nothing else matters wherever I may roam
The microphone's my best friend and the stage is my home
Our music got the sounds, our rhythms got the hooks
I listen to Kenny Rogers, Marvin Gaye and Garth Brooks
I listened to that [?] that's [?] and [?]
But music is good music, the other, is mess
The [?] you chocolate and a peppermint
What color is my soul? Here's a hint: let's hook 'em

[Hook: Champtown, Chaos Kid, Eminem]
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint
Close your eyes and try to guess my tint

My oh my!
[?] someone touches a bottle
The albino brothers steppin' 'em up, we'll wake your [?]
Yeah, I think I'm enough to rhyme so [?] look like a [high-boat?]
I don't play around, we'll run and get the five'o, wait
Hold up! They don't, hold back
To just roll up, they cut no slack
You better step up to bat, or please get a hobby
Cause even a videotape can bring no justice to Rodney
Or IV, I'll put your chest [?] to the point its futile
Get back on your [?] noodle
So you will understand that you won't have the upperhand when
You think I may getting brutal
The America to Bootle
To get the zoom, zam, the zip for the rip
For the kid who had to trip my tint
It's as simple as A-B-Cs and as easy as pie
But is it never to be as intuitive as the question ""why?""
Bullets try to inflictin' pain [?]
[?] shade of soul, huh
[?] skills they haven't even thought about yet
But when I [?] they act as if my color soft as my step

Shit, there ain't idiots bad as the fattest skinniest
Sick with a little rapper to never battle, little, piddle or paddle the prettiest
Dumb fuck, lookin' for the hats or suck a numb
Or jackin' jeans keep your hangin' nuts tucked
And I'm about to take my look up it, up in a book
Plus I'm almost on the top of the booty pull that coppin' a district shit
See you're just barkin up tha wrong tree
Cause I got diarrhea, myamia, I uh be a fuckin' honkey
So bad on the mic gotta make ya titterid kid retell what tha fuck I'm saying
He just talk, but neva the type babbadababa they think they shits so poppa hipty
I'd imagine if I were to put up a zipper to the mic i'd be able to do a lip-sync
Because I rap in this muthafucker there's gotta be a certain rhyme this microphone stick, what the fuck i'll hoist it around inside my home
And the DJ better stick up like a rocket
Cause he could scratch on a fucked up a pool table with 27 pockets
Buttafingaz scratches like a girly fight
But if our color matters, take no less than pearly whites
But I’m hardcore like rocks in a tomato
Gettin' skinned like I was boxing a potato
I wouldn't suck on the mic if it was shaped like a nipple
I done made lots'a money so I'm good if i make like a nickel
But I'm out cold like a snowstorm
So I got nuts so fat, it'll keep my toes warm

558,Day After Day (It's Slippin' Away),"4 AM and it's raining again, another day in rainy Oregon
Hazy in my brain, it's depressing
They say bad weather can be stressing, it's a bother
Cos I'm tryna rhyme shit that actually matters

It's hard to find your soul tether in this bad weather
So I turn to drugs to feel whole, shut indoors
Staring out the window, watching the rain pour
I wish I had a homie

Feeling kinda lonely but all my friends left me
Fuckers played pretend, where the hell are my real friends?
If I had a Benz, or sported swell fashion trends
I bet they'd be piling up and hoes would wanna fuck
But no such luck, I don't have enough
I'm a sittin' duck, floating on the water
I ponder my future as a winner, what a strange creature
Using and fantasizing while holding a knife?
Your deranged life ends tonight

4 AM, I'm trippin' in the worst way
This the time my anger and frustration come out to play
Fantasies of getting paid and enemy combustion
Turn up the danger, I'm deranged
I'm a stranger, I don't know myself
But I know I don't need any help, get it for yourself
Pull a bottle off the shelf, you know you can't cope
At the end of your rope, John Does die slow
It's the only way to go

Slippin away, all because I ain't getting paid
I'm afraid, that I won't make it through the coming day
I'm exaggerating? Wait, if you see it that way
Little beaver so eager, I build a dam to block you from entering the fray
I'm prepared for doomsday, I've locked down the hallway
None of you will get past, thinking you can get me to recalculate my math?
Don't you know, I barely passed?
What's the point in that?

4 AM, I'm trippin' in the worst way
This the time my anger and frustration come out to play
Fantasies of getting paid and enemy combustion
Turn up the danger, I'm deranged
I'm a stranger, I don't know myself
But I know I don't need any help, get it for yourself
Pull a bottle off the shelf, you know you can't cope
At the end of your rope, John Does die slow
It's the only way to go

The frustration in the nation buildin' up, day after day
Everybody tryna get paid, day after day
I'm not the only one, but I'm one of the million
Who ain't satisfied, so I'm tryna get a million
So many tried and died, I'll be eaten up alive
It's the belly of the beast, that I'll reach and defeat
Now you've witnessed my feat, so now you tell me
Check the work put into the record, was it worth the effort?

The other night dear, as I lay dreaming
I dreamt that you were by my side, you'll never know dear
How much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine",Antman,1969,"[57, 59, 72, 76, 83, 83, 97]",7
559,Time Was,"I've got to rearrange my life
I've got to rearrange my world
I miss you, I need you

I've got to keep my memories aside
I've got to try to live again

Time was when there were things around to be afraid of
I've got cause, I couldn't change my mind to turn the tables

Time was there was no need to stop and rearrange it
Now I've got a memory and I don't want to change it

And there's a time for waking up and feeling down
It's when you have to pick your feet up from the ground

Time was when I had you around - I was a strong man
I need you to help me make a change and be a new man

Takes more than a day and a night for giving
It's not so easy to just change your way of living

Time was when there were things around to bother me
The crime was I couldn't start to change my history",Wishbone Ash,1969,"[67, 67, 84, 93, 94]",5

Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess

Get smart get down with the pow wow

Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me

Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver

Let them fabricate success to those who fail

We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Loving the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

[Chorus]
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

[Verse 2]
I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

[Pre-Chorus]
Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're living in a lie of trust

583,Lovin' Things,"It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
Gonna want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do

It's the lovin' things you say
That give me comfort every day
By your side I'm gonna stay
To hear the lovin' things, baby, that you say

Since that day our love began
I've become a new and happy man
I can hold my head up high
When you are near I touch the sky

With your soft and sweet caress
You brought me such tenderness
To think I was once forsaken
With your kiss, I've been awakened

It's the lovin' things you do
That make me grow so close to you
Gonna want you my whole life through
For the lovin' things, baby, that you do

584,These Are Not My People,"First, your mama and your papa sent you to the finest schools
Never let it be said that their little darlin' was a fool
So, with a credit card and your good name
You were drawn like a moth to the flame
To the people of the night where you more or less lost your cool

Ah, you had twenty-twenty vision and still you were walkin' 'round blind
Yes, and whether right or wrong I'd still tag along behind
But you're flyin' too high for me
And if this is how it's got to be
Then it's time to say ""You go your way and I'll go mine""

It's been a gas but I'm gonna have to pass
These are not people, no
These are not my people
And it looks like the end, my friend
Got to get in the wind, my friend

Mm, you found yourself naked in the world with no place to hide
Then you felt for the pulse of your god and he had died
Then your rebels that have got no cause
And your tigers that have got no claws
They promised you the world on a string but you know they lied

Lord, you know, you said you'd be back in a black Cadillac limousine
But you know, I'm inclined to think it's not the kind you mean, no
'Cause when you fall down from off your cloud
And you're just another face in the crowd
They're gonna throw you away like last week's magazine

It's been a gas but I'm gonna have to pass
These are not people, no, no
These are not my people
And it looks like the end, my friend
I got to get in the wind, my friend

It looks like the end, my friend
I got to get in the wind, my friend
It looks like the end, my friend
Got to get in the wind, my friend",Joe South,1969,"[65, 55, 63, 64, 81, 99]",6

588,The Wedding Cake,"Don't be troubled 'bout me 'cause I'm tired
From workin' 'round the house
When day is done
Don't think you failed me
'Cause you can't afford

That dishwasher to make my life more fun
You know, the measure of a man is
Much more than just the money he can make
And every woman knows a lot of joy and tears
Come with the wedding cake

The wedding cake is not all icing
And love and tender whispers in the dark
One slice is concern for all your dreams
Prayed, they won't come true a
And break your heart

Another slice is feeding kids and wiping noses
Crying when the doorbell rings
And there are roses
Every woman knows a lot of give and take
Comes with the wedding cake

It's facing shadows of the future
Prayin' they will fall away
As we walk toward them
Searching for the sun

And it's long and anxious hours
With the wolf at the door
Hugs and kisses when at last
We see the dawn

So when the hands of time trace
Telling lines upon our face
And lace our hair with strands of gray
We laugh and say for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake

Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake
Yes, for all who will partake
It all comes with the wedding cake",Jeannie C. Riley,1969,"[91, 98, 98, 98]",4
589,Hallways Of My Mind,"Silence speaks louder than any words I could hear, only there in presence, mentally I’m not here. I’m a parody of myself, a comedy of dramatic mental health. We’re all looking for the one who will perfect our imperfections, the one who will see only the best perspectives upon gazing at our reflection. Placed doors and exits in the hallways of my mind, opened my cerebral to different highways to see what I would find. Only there in presence, but being there is a present, and through living in the past, I ignore the present

Life’s a bitch and then you die. Unfortunately, death the only thing that enhances our life image no matter how hard you try. Paintings of our caskets metaphorically and artistically explain our inhibition, our suppression tempts us to talk to our inner self but dissuade us from listening. Cause rationality doesn’t necessarily explain our reality. In actuality, the best way to find ourselves is by consistent exhibition of practicality. Despite finding myself, my expensive mind is still lost. And even if I find that, it comes at a great cost

Materialistic comparisons contrast greatly to tangible tangents, contradictory dictators drunk off power advised to drink less until they become powerless. This letter hits home with many, upon taking this hit I’ve realized that all that leaves me traumatized has been told with a slight twist of over-dramatic jest. But I can’t deny what my eyes have seen, nor can I lie that I see it over and over in my dreams. My life has come together, stitched like his forehead at the seams, but despite my predictions, nothing is ever quite what it seems. The specific event goes unstated, the fact is it’s implied. And truth is, when I think about death and appreciation, the two seem to coincide. Posthumously we all seem to be appreciated more even if the love is fabricated. Sugarcoating should give me a warm, sweet vibe, but leaves my mouth with a bitter, shitty, taste

Despite my movement, I’m not sure of my direction. Despite your touch, I’m not sure I can call this affection. Despite my loneliness I wouldn’t call myself isolated. Despite my direction, I wouldn’t consider my life fully navigated. Similar songs have been sung, similar fables have been told. Stories overfed and easily abused, like a dog eating from a fish bowl

Spilling the blood on my toes from my soul onto a pad, periodically giving the things that spill from under my sole and stepping on them as if they bothered me just a tad. Despite my isolation, I’m never cold. Even though that’s the 33rd time I’ve said that and upon claiming it, my opinion turned into mold",IBØ,1969,"[92, 94, 97, 97]",4

[Verse 1]
You gotta know how much you gettin per album to be militant
I could write it for you, you still couldn't deliver it
You get more than a black card for your membership
Paying taxes, holding guns, big benefits
Another pair of Acne jeans, ooh I'm killin sh*t
Got nothin' to lose, got nothin to lose
I'm from the side of L.A. that feel like Beirut
Josh Gibson flow, the black Babe Ruth
Inventory climbing, plane now arriving
She got my double single ready, and my have to have
Wrist on freeze, just left Denver
She wanna be with me cause she know I'm widdit
Caught another metronome off the backboard
I was already known, fuck I rap for?
Cussin at the cop when he harass me
I don't wanna stop if she nasty
Grab her by the weave but you can't hit her
Felt like yesterday we played tag, pick up
I've been down so long, I'ma uplift em
And get the yellow Turbo and do a buck sixty

Who buying you all them fits?
Do you let down that fence?
Opulence is exactly what we strive for
But our women are the gifts we should die for
Why deprive yourself of the five course?
I buy all the twelves, I don't try on

I loved you truely even then and you know I always will
Climbin' over creek banks down by the cotton gin
Chasin' papa's billy goat tearin' my petticoat you cried when I got a whippin'
You cried when my puppy died just because I cried
And I've heard you laugh when in my heart
I knew you wanted to cry and when the truth it might have hurt me
I've heard you tell a lie and that is why I love you like I do

God knows I love you. God knows I do

Now I carry sweet and gentle your first baby child
I live within the bright anticipation of your smile
Even in the bad times it seems like you never gave in
Standin' behind me and fightin' for me blindly and cryin' when I get a whippin'
You cried when my puppy died just because I cried
And I've heard you laugh when in my heart I knew you wanted to cry
And when the truth might have hurt me I've heard you tell a lie and that is why I love you like I do

Who's making love to your old lady
While you were out making love?
Who's making love to your old lady

I found it was a bit too late
Oh yeah, that's when it all happened
Something I never ever dreamed of
Somebody was a-lovin' my old lady
While I was out makin' love

Mom was cooking bread
She wore a dirty, raggedy scarf around her head
Always had her stockings low, rolled to her feet, she just didn't know
She wore a sloppy dress
Oh, no matter how she tried, she always looked a mess
Out of the pot she ate, never used a fork or a dinner plate

I was always so afraid for my uptown friends to see her
Afraid one day when I was grown, that I would be her

In a college town
Away from home, a new identity I found
Said I was born elite, with maids and servants at my feet
I must have been insane
I lied and said Mama died on a weekend trip to Spain
She never got out of the house, never even boarded a train

Married a guy, was living high, I didn't want him to know her
She had a grandson, 2 years old, that I never even showed her

I'm living in shame
Mama, I miss you
I know you're not to blame
Mama, I miss you

Came a telegram
Mama passed away while making homemade jam
Before she died, she cried to see me by her side
She always did her best
Ah, cooking, cleaning, always in the same old dress
Working hard down on her knees, always trying to please

Mama, mama, mama, can you hear me?
Mama, mama, mama, can you hear me?

I'm living in shame
Mama, I miss you
I know you've done your best
Mama, I miss you

Won't you forgive me, Mom?

Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality

Question existence until them questions are solved

From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh

611,Honey (I Miss You),"See the tree, how big it's grown, but friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried

She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb, but kinda smart
And I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her when I came in from working late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck?
Though I pretended hard to be guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly and caught her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early spring when flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away

And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home while she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have are memories of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name

Now my life's an empty stage where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes over head and cries down on the flower bed
That Honey loved

And see the tree, how big it's grown
But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad the first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came and she ran out to brush the snow away

620,Woman Helping Man,"A boy chases a girl until she catches him
But this is one thing he should never see
& the love for her man makes a woman understand
& that's the way love should be

Woman helping man
Underneath God's plan
Woman helping man
& man protecting her the best he can

A man goes through this world trying the best he can
Sometimes his love means sympathy
But when she holds him tight, suddenly everything's all right
That's the way love should be

[Hook: 2x]
Somebody loves you baby..
Oh oh oohh..
Somebody loves you baby..
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

[Verse 1]
Wish I could hug every nigga who done lost a trial
And go see all the ones that ain't visited in a while
To all the goons that down, wish I can help 'em smile
To show my niggas I love 'em, I'll walk a hundred miles
Bless my dawg who got killed in his own house
Help him pull through if he on life support now
The only thang I live for is to make my son proud
My heart go out to all the young niggas runnin' wild
I said a prayer for all the mama's who done lost they child
That 12 year old who wanna fuck, GOD slow her down
Her life all in? Help her turn it 'round
Please reach out and help her GOD before she drown

[Hook:1x]

[Verse 2]
I know that feelin', when it feel like nobody care
When you goin' through yo problems..
It seem like nobody there
I started to question myself, ""If god really care""
Sometimes I cut off all the lights in the room and stare
Wonder if he brought me this far, to drop me off here
I know it seems sometimes that life ain't fair
The say the only thing you can count on in this world is prayer
I prayed so much, I thought that god couldn't hear
Cause I done been through some much bullshit this past year
It's hard to find mufuckas now thats sincere
The streets make it so hard for you to think clear
I'd give up all this shit to have my brother here

[Hook 1x]

[Verse 3]
I gotta call from my homegirl...her mama died
Somebody home invaded and took her life
And just held the phone and listened to her cry
She kept repeating herself, all she asked was ""why?""
Could only imagine what she going through on the inside
Cause when my brotha went to prison... half of me died
Ain't nothin' but pressures in this world, homie they lyin'
You gotta take the good with the bad..
And take it and stride it..
The right amount of pressure could make you commit suicide
But imagine the pressure on a nigga who can't provide
When everything goin' wrong, it's hard to do right
You goin' through it right now
All I wanna say is...

I'm going to join the family circle at the throne
No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by

Come gli occhi del tuo socio quando fuma e collassa
Per un poco ho fatto il frocio che ero sotto per l'ansia
Adesso voglio solo insegnarti come si rappa
E me ne fotto duro perché non sei nessuno
E io invece in questa merda cammino sull'acqua
E me ne fotto duro dei tuoi numeri sul tubo
Io capisco solo trenta, sessanta, novanta
Faccio il cazzo che voglio
Tipo Messi con la palla incollata alla scarpa
Non capisco questo stronzo poi di cosa si vanta
Ne hai chiusa giusta mezza, ti darò una medaglia

It's okay to want before you fall down
You're setting me up on a mission of life
Give it to me, hah
Can't you see I'm a little bit weary
In a three piece suit and shoes that don't fit me
You're bright eyed, bushy tailed, pushing it around
No, I won't let it go, no, I won't stop, so tough

With too much rain
We're trapped in a world

Has the strength to dream

Still I am sure that the answers
Answers gonna come somehow

I'm in the schoolyard rhyming with my brother Jamel and Ra' Allah
Vibe and took the beat, and imagining how far
The sound travel at the turn of the volume
It could shake the gravel, before we heard the loud boom
It vibrated through the parking lot
Shattered a few windshields, set off a sparking shot
The local UPS cat, but we didn't stress that
He had a slow leak, front tire almost flat
I got a cousin think he slicker than the oil in the chain
But I live in an arcade, surrounded by game
He used to pass me bucks, trying gas me up
He was a fast talker, and he kept a flashy cut
From a spot that was on Malcolm X Boulevard
Where this magician, wishing I would pull a card
An optical illusion, and whose hands were quick
But wasn't fast enough not to reveal his trick

Who be the first to set it off and just begun
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one

[Verse 2: GZA & Justice Kareem]
Mass hysteria inside the cafeteria
Not a food fight, but the news might beat your area
Whether by word of mouth, or if you read about it
Extra extra, they felt the need to shout it
The drummer played the beat on the table
His boy kicked a verse, like he was the first and I wasn't able
More prepared to let off anything substantial
If I had no rhymes and my planes was cancelled
Picture that, before you give your bag and expose it
Couldn't develop the color, wonder why he chosed it
See less than the worst competition, to the point
I only use one ear to listen
Was it something I'm missing the food is getting cold
The corners about to flake as soon as I flip the bowl
See the rhyme ain't worth the lunch ticket
Waste of time of mine plus the temp kicked it

655,Son-Of-A Preacher Man,"[Verse 1]
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along

Out through the back yard we'd go walkin'

The look that was in his eyes
Stealin' kisses from me on the sly

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair
And eyes that would tempt any man

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine

And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside

Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""
Then I've looked into her eyes and I saw it
The reflection of my wedding band

To let strange lips lead me on

Carroll County's pointed out as kind of square
The biggest thing that happens is the county fair
And I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event
What we all call the Carroll County accident
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line
Walter Browning lost his life and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die
But she lived long enough for her to testify

[Verse 2]
Now Walter Browning was a happy married man
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand
But it was gone nobody knew just where it went
He'd lost it in the Carroll County accident

[Verse 3]
Mary Ellen testified he flagged her down
Said he was sick and could she drive him into town
And no one even doubted what she said was true
Cause she was well respected in the county too

[Verse 4]
Now I went down to see the wreck like all the rest
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess
But I found something no one else had even seen
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine

[Verse 5]
A little matchbox circled by a rubberband
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
And it took a while to figure out just what it meant
The truth about the Carroll County accident

[Verse 5]
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well
And I took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The secret of the Carroll County accident
Cause the county ordered dad a marble monument

This old heart darling (This old heart of mine)
Weeps for you (It weeps for you)

I try to hide my hurt inside
This old heart of mine always makes me cry
The way you treat me leaves me incomplete
You're in for the day, gone for the week, now
But if you leave me a hundred times
Don't you know that a hundred times I'll take you back
I'm yours, I'm yours whenever you want me
I'm not too proud to shout it
Tell the world about it, cause I

(I love you) Yes I do (I need you baby)
This old heart darling (This old heart of mine)
Weeps for you (It weeps for you)",Tammi Terrell,1969,"[72, 67, 67, 97]",4

Do tell, do tell
Jimmy, I just can't understand it
I know what you mean
I know there's got to be some kind of explanation
There's got to be, there's got to be

678,My World Is Empty Without You,"(Intro)
My mind and soul
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist

(Verse 1)
This my song to the most high, who created all life on earth
Like the birds that fly, the sweet air we breathe
All plants and trees, the sun, and every planet in the galaxy
Yo, they feeding us bullshit with all these books
We didn't ask to be here we got took
Enslaved, and killed, we was raped and hung
We was lied to, and forced to build America
Robbed of our technology, and knowledge of self
The Black man, is the original man of this earth
We can live under the sun, it give us strength
The White man gets sun burn, and cancer of the skin
I got a lot of white friends, I'm not a racist
I acknowledge the most high, I'm not an atheist
I just tell see through the bullshit, and speak my mind
They terrified of my words, so they censor my rhymes
Good lord, I'm crying out to you
Have mercy on the slave masters souls that did us dirty
They don't give a fuck about they own poor white trash
Just imagine how they feel about my black ass
Fuck Christopher Columbus, the Indians was here first
And fuck the Vatican, the pyramids is older
Shot off the nose and lips of our statues
Mad it was black faces, staring 'Back at you'
We even built pyramids on Mars, they won't tell us about that
Cause then we'd realize who we are
When I wrote 'Pearly Gates', they said I hated God
So I wrote this song the creator, the all

(Hook)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)
My world is empty without you baby (without you)

(Verse 2)
This my song for the Almighty, the first and the last
Your bloodline is alive and healthy
These people don't scare us
They call us niggers so much, we wear it
It's like a reminder don't forget it
It's no forgiving, the evils that got the whole world possessed
Under the spell, of the mighty green dollar bill
Got us running 'round shooting people up, beating people up
Sticking people up, selling people drugs
Genocide, suicide, homicide, murder
These are the things that we see being brought up
In cartoons, movies, and history books
We go outside, and it's the real Gunsmoke
Lil' niggas in the hood got car bomb burners, fifty-two shot banana clips
Lil' devil kids getting locked up for life, and do it on purpose
We fearless, and numb to the pain and the hurting... Lord!

Overlook me, underrate me
Probably hate me
Really you should thank me
Get up every time I fall on my face
Like I was plankin’
Tell me what they thinkin’
Don’t want the accolade
This is the 6LACK parade
Smart people follow after me
Is that why y’all attackin’ me?
I want the love child
I am the love child
Do you want the love child?
Here comes the love child
It’s crazy ‘cause even when they aim with hate
I deflect it and aim away
Had the chance to change ya fate
But I change my ways
You know, you niggas can’t relate
So I wanna know
Where is the love child?
White man said I’d never be loved, child
That I was here to go to jail and be a thug child
Run a, run a hood ’til I catch a slug child

[Verse 2: Mereba]
She was from the motherfuckin’ corner
Ain’t she sweet magnolia
Niggas pack heat like furnaces
The bitch got flipped like pancakes
Bitches hate on ya when ya menstruate
She want posta’
‘member what she composed of
She is the love child
Was she the love child?
No you’re the love child
For sure you the love child
We came up from the dirt
The depths of the Earth
The blessed and the cursed
Where less is the mores
Where niggas the most
We lost what we most
So self remorsed
And I am a love child
So you ain’t finna see no fear in my eyes
Sent from above child
‘Cause we never feel no fear in this side
Peaceful but still keep a piece
I pray when I’m hoping to see
I know that it glows around me
I’m not what they hoped I would be

[Verse 3: J.I.D]
Eat, pray, slay, say, show, go give love everyday
Make your way, make wave
Love child, love hurts, love pain
Love fiend, love slave, love me and you gay
Lovingly the normal way
Smack my face and walk away, damn
Uh, I thought this was love child
Playing little games acting like a little child
We break up and you saying I’m a scrub now
Wow damn, pow scram, loud downstairs
And it’s looking like y’all want the bear
I’m hoping there’s more dope in here than you showed me
I’m hoping you don’t show me
But meanwhile, right now I could be
I could be your love child

It always feel right when it go right through
You the only one I get a whole night to
You could see the passion in the way I move
Same shit different clearance, deja vu
From the Earth with a curse with the seance crew
I flow through the sky with a radar too
Got will too strong to let J.R. shoot
I’ve been living in the middle with the chaos too
Blunts power, gun powder, run miles just to get away to the moon
Sun’s power, lungs dying just to inflate from the doom, gravitate to you
Nightmares to dreams, whispers to screams, dark nights I’ve seen brighten some things
By any means, God bless the Queen, God bless the King, the love child is me

[Verse 5: Johnny Venus]
A tip from the child
A drift from you now
Come plummet on down
Slowly coat my tongue
To where you run from
Can’t escape the shadows
Afraid to become
Afraid to be loved
How could I be loved?
Why should I be loved?
My mouth always full with my foot with my love
‘Cause I ain’t ever really satisfied
And I don’t really want but everything
Put out could see the side of mine
And that’s a recipe for my demise
‘Cause I never had a missing piece
Swear I never ever really need a thing
But that is the love child
Showers the tears
To baptize my peers
Now bring me the mud child
No can’t stop the rain
No can’t stop the pain this sent from above
You’ve got to have love
You’ve got to have love child
But lust is the flood
The trust is the words swept under the rug

When the sunlight finally blossoms way up high
Purple shadows fall across the countryside
We could get together for a rainbow ride
Close your eyes and let it happen
Bright and breezy, nice and easy
Hold on while the music takes you way up high
We can race the moon across the evening sky
See the night time rainbow colors flying by
Close your eyes and let it happen
Rising, falling, gently calling you
Let the evening fly away
While you're dreaming
Come on, take a rainbow ride with me

Let the evening fly away

Surely blow your mind

He had a girl who loved him

Honest and all
To keep your man
You drive hm up the wall

Now this here girl
The one whose man left her
To look around the world

Took my advice and and
Her love affairs were fine

The man she loved returned
To take her breath away
She made him cry
She made him beg her
Then she said goodbye

694,Saturday Night At The World,"It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking it's over girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one

But his voice seemed to answer the echoing silence
From yesterday's asking
And waiting and listening
For something resembling a song
To be sung back to me

It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking it's over girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one

But his eyes seemed quicksilver
Reflecting the prisms I kindled
Uneclipsed by the darkness of loving's mirages
That swindle the heart
With the shadow of me

And his love seemed to offer a sojourn
From endless beginnings
And so I went spinning into him
To love him, but found him
One answer for loving and losing the same

It's a saturday's night at the world
I am thinking it's over girl
And how useless to search it becomes
When you seek all the answers in one",Esther Ofarim - אסתר עופרים,1969,[99],1

The pain your eyes reveal
The pain your eyes reveal
From foolish things I've done
The times that I let you down
And I'll never change, believe me I try
If you go away, you know that I'll die
Oh I love you, please don't say goodbye

Bella Linda, try and understand
Bella Linda, I'm doin' all I can
Bella Linda, I'm only what I am

We've had bad times
Through the years
And though I've made you cry
Think of me through tender tears

And try to close your eyes
To thoughtless things I do
The dreams that don't come true

If you go away, you know that I'll die

697,A Ray Of Hope,"Most people got soul if they wanna try
Let love be your goal and let it fly
Cause it's easy to hate and to draw a line
But error is human forgiveness is divine

I know a lot of people who think like me
That this world can be a place that's filled with harmony
First there's a lot of things we've got to rearrange
Put an end to hate and lies
So peace can come and truth shall reign
As long as there is a ray of hope

Lord, I don't mind going out and doin' my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
Help us to make His dream understood

Sometimes the road gets a little bit rough
Your strength is all gone, you had enough
But there's people who win without making fists
Our world won't survive lest we think like this

I can't imagine any greater need
To treat each other as we'd like to be
It's a gas just knowing what is yet to come
Not unless we get together
Got to get together one by one

As long as there is a ray of hope
Lord, I don't mind goin' out and doin' my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
I got to keep on searchin', keep on searchin'
Till I find out
Keep on searchin', keep on searchin'
Till I find out
Keep on searchin', keep on searchin'
Till I find out

Gonna take a little look way down inside
Gotta find out Lord, why I'm alive
We'll pray for a day when all men are free
And people can live like they're meant to be
Meanwhile it's all up to you and me
Start working together towards this dream

As long as there is a ray of hope
Lord, I don't mind goin' out and doin' my work
Light up the way to brotherhood
Help us to make His dream understood

699,Looking Back,"[Verse 1: NATTI]
You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested?
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war, sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
To make x-rated into nc-17
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone
So...

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
If this is not the hardest part
I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine
I'll come clean
Leave me be, baby

Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Looking back

[Verse 2: Deacon the Villain]
Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse, sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here, I'm talking bout one at a time though
Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here, says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds

Take you away

So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

[Refrain 1]
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

[Verse 5]
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

[Verse 6]
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

708,Crosstown Traffic,"[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride

[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you

Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain

Boy and girl they fell in love
Each was like the heavens above
He looked in her eyes of blue
She vowed to him that she'd be true

Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me

I miss you, oh can't you see?
You're the only girl for me
Soon you're gone
And I'm all alone

710,Isn't It Lonely Together,"Why do I seem to confuse you
Do I lose you
Do I really look so strange
A woman alone is a danger
Is a stranger
She is better off in chains

Oh, how can it be you're happier now
Don't you feel half of you has gone
Sorry to say I've never felt so together
I've never felt this strong

I'm on my own again
And it's never felt so good

I don't feel broken hearted
Don't feel that I should
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive

Why do you want to control me
Try to own me
Like a pet you'd like to tame
Don't look at me like I'm crazy
That's just lazy
Cause it's you that's got to change

Oh, how can it be you're happier now

I'm on my own again
After all the years inside

I've destroyed all the things that hurt me
Rediscovered my pride
I'm on my own again
Hard to believe but I never felt so alive

Feels so alive
I feel so alive

I'm on my own again
And it's never felt so good

A thousand hopeful dreams I've had
Are finally coming true
I use to put you on a pedestal
Where you became untouchable
But now we touch and now so much is possible
Just being near to you
Would be enough for me
The many years without your love
Have been so rough for me
But now a change is taking place in me
I found someone whose faith in me has given me
The strength I need so desperately

In my time mmmmmmm turn on the line
My illusions vanish over night
But now I'm loving you is now reality

Now, where exactly are we going... exactly?
Where the rainbow ends
Where the rainbow ends?
Don't you want to go where the rainbow ends?
Well, now that depends where that is
Well, let's find out

[Verse 1: DejaVu]
I feel the dirt, deep in the paint I feel the Earth
An ancient curse, out in the fields I plant, it hurts
The planet hurts, dressed in all black like a hearse
When my soul all white like a nurse
It's alright
The time is now, I think the clouds are forming in the night
I have to make the formula right
They sittin' at the giants height
I got slings and arrows and my timing is tight
Yeah and my rhyming is nice
I'm a creature from the lagoon
I hear some cryptozoological bumps in the night
That's some shit, am I right?
I got some tips how to fight
Don't give a fuck in the light
Cause' I ain't fuckin' around
I'm stompin' 'round in my town

[Chorus 1: DejaVu]
Eyes wide shut, eyes wide shut
The truth is deep, it just needs to be cut
Eyes wide shut, eyes wide shut
They meetin' in secret, I think it needs to be stopped

[Verse 2: DejaVu]
My vodka cheap, swimmin' in the muddy waters
I'm a funny bitch, I feel like John Waters
I'ma terminate ya' just like I'm John Connor
Gold stars, just like I graduated with honors
Back in time, I remember a time when we were just sons and daughters
Tap the tree, just so I can get some green and water
Family fire starter, made the beat now make me a martyr
I've got something to prove, ain't shit sweet like Aaron Carter
Shufflin' my cards for better barters
Passive money, I'm coding a better botter
I'm leading the horse to water
I'm a hot boy like a Carter
Something that I do often
Loyalty, get 'em off me
They tryin' box me in, no Mayweather

[Chorus 2: DejaVu]
Eyes wide shut, eyes wide shut
The truth is deep, it just needs to be cut
Eyes wide shut, eyes wide shut
They meetin' in secret, I think it needs to be stopped

[Verse 3: Jay The Maverick)
Both eyes closed, I got my third eye open
Momma hopin' that I stop the tokin'
But I ain't jokin', I always been a fiend
I always had this merry magic
Now I feel like I'm the king
I got rings up on my hand
And I'm ready to fucking blow
You can see me, I be goin' H.A.M. at my very first show
And my boy just made this beat
So we gotta make it neat
I be going in this game and I don't ever miss a beat
I'm a young kid with big dreams, I'ma do what I do
Everybody be hatin', cause I always keep it true
Not the same for you, you've always been so fake
I feel like my eyes closed, but I've never been more awake

The truth is deep, it just needs to be cut

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

For she once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Without any seam nor needlework
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to wash it in yonder dry well

Which never sprung water nor rain ever fell
And then she'll be a true love of mine

Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn

717,See Saw,"It was a good start
The ups and downs, themselves
Before I knew it, we grew tired
With meaningless emotional drains

Repeated seesaw game
Now, I'm so sick of this
Repeated seesaw game
We're getting sick and tired of each other

Were the petty arguments the start?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there have never been parallels in the first place
Maybe it was my greed trying to match myself with you
If it was love, and if this is what love means
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
We're tired of each other, yet seem to be holding the same cards
Well, then

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

Let's not measure who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
This repeated seesaw game
Let's end this now

People can be so crafty
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
But because we don't want to be the villains
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
Although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted

At first, we showed off who was heavier
We bragged and smiled at each other
Now we're trying measure who's heavier
A competition between us
That became a flame, igniting quarrels
It’ll only end if someone gets off right here
Acting like we’re comforting each other
With words mixed with thorns
Can’t keep doing this, we need to make a decision

If we didn’t have feelings for each other
If we didn’t think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if you don’t have any more feelings
This seesaw is dangerous
Stop thinking about me

Alright, a repeating seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, this boring seesaw game
Somebody has to get off of it
There's no turning back

(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you
(Hol' up Hol' up) Just like the beginning when you weren't here
(Hol' up Hol' up) I walk on this seesaw without you

724,I Can't Turn You Loose,"""Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen and welcome to the Universal Amphitheater. Well, here it is the late 1970's going on 1985. Y'know so much of the music we here today is pre-programmed electronic disco, we never get a chance to hear master blues men practicing their craft anymore. By the year 2006, the music known today as the blues will exist only in the classical records department of your local public library. So tonight, Ladies and Gentlemen, while we still can, let us welcome from Rock Island, Illinois, the blues men of Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, The Blues Brothers!""",The Blues Brothers,1969,"[67, 50]",2

If I only had time

If I only had time

And you should see what you have done to them
Things ain't what they used to be
