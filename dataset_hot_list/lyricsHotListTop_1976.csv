0,Tonight's The Night (Gonna Be Alright),"[Verse 1]
Stay away from my window
Stay away from my back door too

Loosen off that pretty French gown

It's gonna be alright
'Cause I love you girl
Ain't nobody gonna stop us now

You'd be a fool to stop this tide
Spread your wings and let me come inside 'cause

Hand me down my walkin' cane

Once I went to hear him play
At a club outside of town

4,More Than A Feeling,"[Verse 1]
I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
I lost myself in a familiar song
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Verse 2]
So many people have come and gone
Their faces fade as the years go by
Yet I still recall as I wander on
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
'Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walkin' away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When I'm tired and thinking cold
I hide in my music, forget the day
And dream of a girl I used to know
I closed my eyes and she slipped away

She slipped away

[Chorus]
It's more than a feeling (more than a feeling)
When I hear that old song they used to play (more than a feeling)
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

5,Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word,"[Chorus]
What have I got to do to make you love me
What have I got to do to make you care
What do I do when lightning strikes me
And I wake to find that you're not there

What do I do to make you want me
What have I got to do to be heard
What do I say when it's all over
And sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word
It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over
Oh it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

6,I Wish,"[Intro]
Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

12,I Never Cry,"If there is a tear on my face
It makes me shiver to the bone
It shakes me, Babe
It's just a heartache that got caught in my eye
And you know I never cry, I never cry

Sometimes I drink more than I need
Until the TV's dead and gone
I may be lonely
But I'm never alone
And the night may pass me by
But I'll never cry

Take away, take away my eyes
Sometimes I'd rather be blind
Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't you leave it alone

'Cuz that's all I got to give you
Believe me Babe, it ain't been used
My heart's a virgin, its never been tried
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
And you know I'll never cry
Never cry, I'll never cry

Break a heart, break a heart of stone
Open it up but don't leave, don't you leave me alone

So tell me you're that somebody""

In the evening
It's pretty pleasing

Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land
And they shimmy
And Sammy's so skinny

And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singing and jinging the jango
Floating like the heavens above
Looks like muskrat love

Nibbling on bacon, chewing on cheese
Sammy says to Susie, ""honey, would you please
Be my missus?""
And she says yes with her kisses

And now he's tickling her fancy, rubbing her toes
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes
As they wriggle
And Sue starts to giggle

And search the world to find
The words to make it right

Isn't worth the trouble of

As a ship without a wheel
A touch without a feel

And someday soon
I'll wake
And find my heart
Won't have to break

One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs
You asked the wrong guy son
I'm from Atlanta, yeah we know Mr. Coles
Flew in two days ago to see his fam'
But we been watching you, crazily
The whole Staten Island shitting on you

Holding snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not truck today, still looking fly, still slammed up hung
You mind popping your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the six, five years probash'
You dealing with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watching you
Make me wanna lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwing me down, grab my gun
Go head bust me
Heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You make the 13th nigga
A multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo
Where the hell's the RZA
He's selling mics, wireless joints
Special made to go off in your hand and which went out on point

That never gave a fuck about a scantron?

And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man

Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models

With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was fooling 'cause she knew what she was doing
And I knew love was here to stay when she told me to

Little skirt's climbing way up her knee

Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss, like this

Even though she knows how much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word let me tell you, I love you
Let me hold you close and say these words as gently as I can

There's been another man that I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows he can't possess me and he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me that only he can fill

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said
I swear they still are true
For no one else can have the part of me I gave to you

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

I couldn't really blame you if you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside, I'm asking you to stay

Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules

Torn between two lovers

Feelin' like a fool

28,I Like Dreamin',"I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light

I see us on the shore beneath the bright sunshine
We've walked along St. Thomas beach a million times
Hand in hand, two barefoot lovers kissing in the sand
Side by side, the tide rolls in
I'm touching you, you're touching me
If only it could be

I like dreamin' cause dreamin' can make you mine
I like dreamin', closing my eyes and feeling fine
When the lights go down, I'm holding you so tight
Got you in my arms and it's paradise 'til the morning light

Through each dream, how our love has grown
I see us with our children and our happy home
Little smiles, so warm and tender looking up at us
Blessed by love, the one we shared
Till I wake, and reach for you
And you're just not there

I like dreamin' 'cause dreaming can make you mine
I like holding you close and touching your skin
Even if it's in my mind
Oh, sweet dream baby, I love you
Oh, my sweet dream baby, you're in my dreams every night
Oh sweet dreams, I like feelin you
Oh sweet dreams baby, Don't keep me waiting all my life",Kenny Nolan,1976,"[30, 35, 39, 45, 55, 67, 78, 89]",8
29,Love So Right,"She came on like the night, and she held on tight
And the world was right when she made love to me
We were free
She moved in like a friend
Started loving me
And I thought I'd found my heaven in her arms
But the morning when I woke up
I was here and she was gone
Now I'm hanging on
Maybe you can tell me

[Chorus]
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?

Where did she go
When I need her close to me?
And the perfect story ended at the start
I thought you came forever
And you came to break my heart
Now I'm hanging on
On the chance that you'll come back to me
Oh, my love

[Chorus]
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling

[Bridge]
I could take it in my stride
Start living for the moment
Maybe half the things we sought were never there
Simply open up our eyes
And break it down to size
It isn't really fair

How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?
Oh, my darling
How a love so right
Can turn out to be so wrong?",Bee Gees,1976,"[31, 21, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16, 23, 32, 52, 70]",15
30,Blinded By The Light,"[Hook: Collins]
Blinded by the lights (Blinded by the lights)
Waiting for a sign (Waiting for a sign)
You thought I was fine (Fine, fine, fine)
I'm losing my mind (Mind, mind, mind)

[Verse 1: Futuristic]
Yo, I ain't blinded, I'm finally seeing correctly
I had class until niggas started to test me
I surpassed what everybody I knew was doing
They hope to do it, so I help em' do it and then they left me
Ain't that a bitch, literally that's a bitch
Niggas seen the light and then they felt like they just had to switch
I ain't ask for shit, they looking for an ass to kiss
I'm drunk as fuck with a girl I used to fuck, I'd probably grab her tits
I'm smashing in a whip, navigation, the music blasting
Getting head with my girl on the phone, how could I let this happen
Fuck it, I'm extra spazzing, hit the bathroom for a second
Threw up on my jacket and pissed in the liquor section
And I don't even regret it, that's the worst part
Don't have a purpose, I'm doing whatever sounds fun
The music is something I really used to love
But what do you do when your sounds done, I'm found numb
I bought a gun with intentions to blow my brains out
Took my money out the bank and put it all in envelopes
Gave my mama four, gave my brother five, gave my cousin two
Gave my DJ three, I'm trying to get this pain out
I wondered who would come and get the stains out
Or who would hear it, eventually take the same route
I typed a post on my page for all of my fans
I bet if I actually did I'd have the fame now
And niggas still begging me to put em' on
Begging me to play they songs
Can't you tell I ain't this shit myself
You don't even like my tracks, you ain't bought one hit
But you mad cause you asked, but won't get my help
Stop it, I got my own situations that I've been facing
These dreams that I'm always chasing, but they rarely ever come true
This family that I left, that woman I used to love
So the least of my concerns is you

[Hook: Collins]
Blinded by the lights (Blinded by the lights)
Waiting for a sign (Waiting for a sign)

33,Weekend In New England,"Last night, I said goodbye
Now it seems year
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you
Bringing us near

And tell me
When will our eyes meet
When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you, by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And, tell me
When will our eyes meet
When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow

With you
I can bring out
All the love, that I have
With you there's a heaven
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me
When will our eyes meet
When can I touch you
When will this strong yearning end
And when will I hold you again",Roger Whittaker,1976,"[35, 50, 58, 68, 78]",5

First thing I hear when I touch down is “Surf, the Midwest groovin'
Such and such nice, what’s his name doin' his numbers
And I don’t see the Midwest losin'.”
Well, I could think of a few verbs, for the niggas that think they ill
I come through the Midwest cruisin'
X all factors, hit all men tryna holla—
Ayy, Hitman, let me holla at you
I brought enough for you and ShowwOutt
And anybody that show out
Already got my other half, I’ll clear this fuckin' show out
'Bout to get this nigga dressed, no he ain’t about to go out
I need that old Hitman, tank top with the rope out
Yett Yett, what? This 60's shit is somethin' you don’t know 'bout
You said you wanted to ride… well, Gerald let’s roll out
Me and my strap got two different visions, but I see hands so clear
Mines goin' out blazin', clips droppin', no fear
Look like a car crash, he get the bag, no air
That tre see morgue and he don’t wanna go there
They say Tsu Surf cold but all he talk about is hoopin’
‘Cause I feel like I’m shootin' when I squirt pounds
And as long as them cans is close, his wig in by the first round
If it’s hard, but not real, I don’t care about ya bar
He get two to the chest; I slid up on duke and drew with finesse
My big homie told me how them streets play out is wild
That mean if this mark is smart he’ll stay out the crowd
How you average 26.6, moonwalk on skates
AND clap heat? You are not a shooter
Feet, hand, sticks: Amadou ya, that’s how I’ma do you
Raised in that croc pool, send some piranhas to ya
Lift the Hitman up to God, can I get a ""Hallelujah""?
I’m always reachin' ‘cause a paranoia trip's way better than nervous
Chilled against Charlie but still here
I think I handled that Clip better than Curtis
So Hitman will front, and ShowwOutt is back?
Boy, I make Hitman front show out his back
Fuck Cable, this could happen on demand, it’s go time
Was on the net flickin' through your music, got bored in no time
How much you weighin', brother?
It don’t really matter when it’s yo' time
I send him MAC's, he pay per round – Verb, it’s showtime
And every single nigga you see me with, I clap for him
Gotta give him six, man, can he?
Better pray Antoine come back for ‘em
They say Surf reach a lot, maybe 'cause Surf reach a lot
This new Cal I’m buyin' stupid, period, I’ll teach a block
Columbine, period, teacher, block…
This gun talk 101, I can teach a block
I don’t know about you, but I ain’t tryna get shot for shit
It became so normal, I reach when I ain’t got the shit
I ain’t a Proving Ground nigga, this ain't proven ground, nigga
Been gettin' a million views, what you provin' now, nigga?
Jersey!

[Round 1: Hitman Holla]
Besides the fact you got killed in your last war
You said you want that Hitman with that rope chain and that tank top? Be careful what you ask for
Fuck you and any nigga that co-sign him!
Man, I’ll hold your daughter over the boat
Like, “Surf your daddy?” (“Yeah?”) “Well, go find him!”
It’s a wrap now, two big 40's and a MAC round
The Shotgun I brought do way more than a pat down
You crippin'? I roll with B's
You talkin' all that basketball shit
'Til I Eurostep with the switchblade and X him over C's
Me lose tonight? No fuckin' way
Smack, do not call time, ‘cause I got a lot of shit I gotta fuckin' say
Example: I made my own name, my nigga, I was in top form
I came to the stage, the people they got they popcorn
They call you Tsu Surf ‘cause you waited on a Loaded Lux co-sign wave and hopped on – that’s bitch shit
Ridin' a nigga dick – that's some sissy shit
Well, I’m strapped in your neighborhood with two 30's
Let’s see if y’all really about that 60’s shit
Honestly, fuck who came with you tonight, y’all all lunch
I got a brand new black MAK-90 with no rubber grip
That’s for the raw bunch
You seen what I did to Ars and Red? This your way to learn
Man, I done hung up more Jersey niggas than David Stern
I’m pissed and I’m not in the mood, don’t talk slick to me
I’m gifted, I win off presence: no Christmas tree
I’m way too much, to win you need a glitch from me
I’m Stevie Wonder: subtitles don’t mean shit to me
Y’all praise him for gettin' booked for possession?
I’m finna say, what, y’all happy he floss with it?
‘Cause where I’m from we praise the shooters
Not the niggas that get caught with it
Man, I’m undefeated with a weapon… shit, I’m a boss, nigga
And it’s loaded, fuck Lux!, this Calico ain’t lost, nigga
My boys in the hood, I brought plenty convicts
And death is the answer to any conflict
You brought Suge, I’m like, “Why? That nigga’s a bitch!”
We ain’t seen Shotgun put in work since Ricky got hit
Fuck peace, I like the streets, shots and sirens
Whole hood got jobs ‘cause the block is hirin'
Potato on the deadbeat: that mean the pop is silent
Me and my niggas’ll walk through your neighborhood
Like we tryna stop the violence
Chill ‘fore I flash one, remix that blast, son
“Holla, let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
I’m thinkin' about shootin' a nigga, pull that beam out
Shots go right through his chest, rip his spleen out
The doctors pull his dreams out, his mama—
“Fuck that, Holla, I’ll knock him clean out!”
Say it again? Fuck it, I’ma remix it
Chill ‘fore I flash one, remix that blast, son
“Holla let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
“Holla let me get him!” – nah, you fucked up my last one
I’m thinkin' about shootin' a nigga, pull that beam out
Shots go right through his chest, rip his spleen out
Shots shots shots go right through his chest
Rip his spleen out, the doctors pull his dreams out
His mama— “Fuck that, Holla— fuck that, Holla—
Fuck that, Holla, I’ll knock him clean out!!!”
They ask why always use ShowwOutt as a prop
Be-motherfucking-cause
That nigga ain’t a prop, that’s my motherfuckin' blood
Big Gerald raised us on that motherfuckin' belt
And said, ""Fuck a fair fight, that other brother better help!""
Speakin' of fight, y’all thought that scuffle was fake and I hate that
It wasn’t a big deal for real, y’all made it that
Well, I’m callin' niggas’ bluff, Surf, let’s have a cage match
Can’t nobody leave 'til a nigga dead: stage that
Whole bunch of mics on his head: I parade that
Uppercut and swing like an Atlanta Brave cat
Tay Roc, keep my motherfuckin' name out your mouth
Lil nigga, I’ll expose you
If you need help just say you need help, I’ll mold you
It’s either that or get a casket bed, they’ll close you
His bitch will have to open the box to see Roc like a proposal
Anybody takin' bets, shit, where the bets, clowns?
I’ma let you in on a hint, this ain’t even my best round
What’s big money to small change?!
Two words after this: BALL GAME!

[Round 2: Tsu Surf]
See, that’s where I can agree with you
That nigga from B-more, sometimes I wanna clothesline him
Dump him somewhere and let somebody nobody knows find him
Cops and the dog, y’all wake me up when those find him
Tay get a tombstone, you see 'Roc' on the rock like Hov signed him
Okay, I got caught with a strap, fuck it, I did a bid with it
Thank God they caught him for possession
And they ain’t catch him for what he did with it
I’m wherever Yett Yett at, strap out, it ain’t in the tuck
You might have a Calico loaded with hollows
So a good six rounds could just be beginner’s luck
I came to murder somethin'
I mean you got a few wins, yeah, that could be true
But I also know ShowwOutt got just as many wins as you
I can’t be mad at ShowwOutt, but if you take Show out
Nobody that catch the gun will catch you
Somebody tell me what this show 'bout
What you gon' do? Slide up on me like baggage claim?
Re-remix then clap me up kill?
Wait a minute, your lil brother took the tab on that Bill
If I could reload with the same bullets that I shot with
I’m about to stuff these Mossberg shells in this Glock clip
Queen Latifah ""Set It Off"" mask, jump in the 380
Cops catch him, fuck it, it was ugly, he could plead crazy
Lock pick the door, “Errrrhhh!!” they sleep, baby
See his son, “BAH!” I'll G Baby G baby
What, I need to remix it or somethin'? Nah, I won’t
Slide Smack a stack to get it in the building, you ain’t gettin' far
Fuck I gotta put it in subtitles? You ain’t get the bar?
Nigga, you can’t read, it ain’t in the car
""This brand new Nina, who gon' take one for the team?""
That was mean, hella body
But this pump like a jump: that bitch down to hit everybody
With a ladder long clip, that’s for when we ride though
That’s your lil man? When we catch him he dyin', bro
Hit him with a 60 second clip to the slide Show
I got double 9's, my mans got double 9's, we’ll shake shit
I’ll let a round off from this semi tuck, that’s a great flip
He let a round off from that semi tuck, another great flip
Boy, we’ll put two and two together like it make sense
When was your last body?
Phara and Shooney? That shit bored me
Only time I’m comin' at two bitches is in an orgy
I just cop some new bullets, I call 'em edibles
Is he a G? No, a Smith in his back will be terrible
My logic is, if I send 100 shots he can’t duck 'em all
Clip of hot peppers: Holla, I’ll pin yo' head to the fuckin' wall
And if I gotta ride or somethin', all black disguise or somethin'
Timbos, cargos, mask with a 9 or somethin'
You gon' need God, hidin' tips from Saddam or somethin'
Mike Brown: that boy gon' die for nothin'

[Round 2: Hitman Holla]
You asked when’s the last time I bodied
Phara and Shooney? When the last time you bodied a nigga?
That nigga from the S.O.N.S.? Stop, y’all need to quit
D boys the only niggas that brag about gettin' rid of bricks
You had a classic vers’ Shine, but he ain’t really shit
You shined vers’ X, but that was really it
My right hand man will shoot you, then plead the fifth
But why? When I can give my own shot like I ain’t need the pick
My homie said “Who?” I said “All,” I ain’t need to pick
The scope, I went right through the screen
Like I ain’t need the switch
Fresh out of retirement, yeah, they don’t like that
.45, bald head, they yelling ""Mike back!""
King of performance, yeah, they yelling ""Mike back!""
Worldstar TKO’s, they yelling ""Mike back!""
Kill one of mine, that’s cool, I’m comin' right back
And kill two of yours and make you come get a life back
That Internet beef you be on will get your wife snatched
That money Smack gave you tonight will get your wife back
So what if I’m whoopin' yo' ass, Surf… (Fight back!)
You be sleepin' on Budden couch like that’s your father
Well, what’s all that rappin' for?
What’s all that kidnappin' niggas for bricks and all that trappin' for?
Man, stop, I’ll clap the 4
Kill Surf, he gon' have to bury his son: I’ll Jackson Joe
Man, what time your girl get off? We in that van waitin'
We all in the front yard like we landscapin'
We all in your living room with the cans blazin'
Boo bop, bop bop bop bop!
Ain’t Red your man? Just tell him give you that translation!
I watched Goodz big boy you
What kind of star lets another nigga tell him go run a pack?
What, you ain’t have them gadgets blitty?
Well, it’s gon' be perfection how this KOD
If Tsu’s ever in me or Magic's city
Oh, y’all ain’t catch that? This Jersey girl gettin' zipped up
In other words, I got that metal on stage like a strip club
Random: but Suge so fuckin' terrible
I coulda beat both of y’all, same night
If they was on stage measurin' hearts
Me and Suge would be the same height
Or Tsu Surf’s gon be a watery death, broad day, plain sight
His momma gon have to wear a bathing suit
And scuba gear to visit the grave site
If I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon have the crowd Surf and ‘em in the ambulance
Fuck, y’all waitin' on that subtitle or somethin'?
I said if I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon have to crowd surf him to the ambulance
Fuck, y’all waitin' to remix that subtitle or somethin'?
I said if I use this heavy metal
Y’all gon' have to crowd surf him to the…
Crowd surf him to the… crowd surf him to the ambulance
I’m just tryna get on the same page as you
How Arsonal and Red left you booked? Shotgun made you ride solo? And these the niggas that’s on stage with you?!
That wasn’t played well, ‘cause I guarantee
If that was me… Magic, Ill and Verb woulda spent every goddamn night in Detroit until I made bail
It was four of them, one pistol – you was gon' raise hell?
If it’s four of us it’s four pistols
We woulda all had to sit in that same cell
But now it’s “hee-hee-haa-haa,” man, that’s weak shit
And how ironic that this college nigga
Whippin' this hood nigga on some street shit
I mean, I could talk about how you be reach—
I’ma save that for round three, bitch! BALL GAME!

[Round 3: Tsu Surf]
I hear everything you sayin', but let’s discuss somethin' that’s apparent… Hitman Holla, cold killa!
But Gerald Fulton grew up with both parents
Now, I’m not knockin' havin' both parents
But your situation wasn’t the worst
Like, everything Mommy ain’t have on the 15th
Daddy could cover on the 1st
He probably taught you that 5 step drop back
And that spiral almost amazingly
I taught myself you gotta ease off that trigger slow
Let that hammer up simultaneously
He probably taught you about the birds and the bees
Chlamydia, clap and all about crabs
Man, them niggas was out the window with the bird
Throwin' out B’s, clappin', callin' out “Crabs!”
You was at practice shootin', if you missed you'd do suicides
Them niggas came through shootin'
That was our practice; if we missed, that was suicide
Every time I feel some type of way about my hood
These family niggas be remindin' me
See, we both real niggas, but you a different kind to me
Math, English, lunch – you was on a different time than me
I pull up: gym, I pull out: trigonometry
You had X squared over Y
Tryna find the remainder, then add up
I’m askin' my ex, “Why
You askin' me about numbers? I’m tryna bag up.”
Your father probably bought your mother coat
All your sports gear and your brother boots
No football, these gloves wasn’t for baseball
This face mask was for other use
Your mother was at the game, cardboard colors, fresh signs
My mother was in pain
""You wanna speak to the inmate, press 9.""
You get off the court, woo! Daddy right there
“Congratulations you did it.” – I won’t say I’m jealous
But me and Mommy had to wait to Wednesday to kick it
I know you won’t get it
Shit, I have flashbacks when I spit it
But Wednesday and Thursday, that was assigned visits
I just feel like Big Gerald John Witherspoon and you Craig
What you doin' with that Glock?
I mean, back on the West Side
They ain’t have guns, we had these to rock
I admit if I was in his position I probably woulda stopped
We got so much in common: both protected by them pops
Moral of the story, all that fuckin' school and you ain’t learn shit
Put him in my hood one time, boy, and you’ll turn bitch
If Verb woulda holla’d for my father… he wouldn’t have heard shit!
If you say you was wrestlin' in the streets
You a Stone Cold Stunner, you was home with your mother
Watchin' wrestling: Rock, Raw, Chyna, Smackdown
We was in the trap house: raw, rock, china gettin' smacked down
Jersey!

[Round 3: Hitman Holla]
New Jersey was like the Celtics at one point in time
Y’all had the Big 4: KG, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Rondo
But y’all all split up and started fallin' off
It was only a matter of time though
I see y’all lookin' like, ""Well, who’s who?""
Ars, he was once MVP, so that’s KG
That’s just right off the hunch, O-Red = Ray Allen
‘Cause he probably the deadliest shooter out of the bunch
Won’t y’all help me think of somebody for Suge? ‘Cause I’m tryin'
I mean I could call Shotgun “The Truth,” but I’d be lyin'
And Surf, you Rondo, not ‘cause you be runnin' shit
It’s ‘cause your first name Rajon, let’s bring that back
Us, them, it ain’t hard to figure out who the ops
Hitman vs Arsonal, I got rid of that big ticket like I knew the cop
After that battle they looked at St. Louis and believed us
Hitman vs O-Red: I called him Ray Allen
‘Cause I sent that nigga to Jesus
Hitman vs Shotgun Suge, I’ma need a serious check
So that just leave Surf, yet and still he ain’t a serious threat
‘Cause I’m appalled how
Rajon ain’t been on point since his parents left
Everything from AR’s to Glocks in his face
Chinese choppers, they sound different
You could tell they not from the States
“Brackow! Brackow,” shit that’ll make Barack leave the States
My city got me paranoid, so I’m shootin' at any cop on the chase
And if Qua jump in, he get it the same way
I killed his dog, now me and Calicoe fightin' the same case
We two different Rugrats
‘Cause you a rat and you tell what you seen for a hobby
I’m Angelica, that’s ‘cause I get mean with the Tommy
Y’all remember that Michael Jackson Motown glove?
Well, I use that to clean up the shotty, and left it on the scene
Cops thought a nigga Billie Jean’d at the homi
""You are in the middle of that *CH-CH*: that’s CHURCH""
I mean, before y’all say I’m hatin'
Just explain to me, what 'church' had to do with that situation?
Then you had the nerve to say
“I’m too advance for these niggas, and it hurts.”
No, you just reach too fuckin' much and they let it work
Well, since they let you get away with it
Let me try it, and I’ma do it worse
Check, code name San Fran, that’s forty 9's, and when it burst
You are in the middle of that SF: that’s SURF
I see you over there lookin' like, “That last shit ain’t hit like that?”
But you woulda screamed and went crazy
When he say shit like that
I got them things like Tambourines, we clap at whoever
I treat your block like a URL card and smack it together
They found his body so distorted he was backwards together
Me and ShowwOutt the male version of Serena and Venus
Same parents but we swing ratchets together
I got some shit that’ll flip a nigga, he’ll tumble on the spot
I don’t even drink, but I took some shots
Then I stumbled to his pops
I’m like, “I brought them Nick Cannons
You know? Braataa Braataa, Brrrrrrrr-POP!”
Man, I be feelin' like a Piston in Detroit
When I’m drummin' on the block
You either gon' respect me or respect me, ain’t no in and out
Stay in your lane, don’t cross over like an in-an-out
It’s real where I’m from, you playin', you took the scrimmage route
It’s all fun 'til you layin' with your ligaments out
Surf, I’m a beast, peep, I bring extenders out
A star that’ll play with them birds: I took the Emmitt route
You Crippin' on the net; in person, what that image 'bout?

40,What Can I Say,"[Intro: Dave Chapelle]
This is OG season
I'm your man, Dave Chapelle just shouting at everybody who went through it
Who stayed the course, who held firm
I don't know what to say, nigga, I don't know what to say

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for a safe
Made way more money than mistakes
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Maybe, I should start with my first point
Started out selling weed in the shake joint
I went from nothing to playing on a world tour
What else could a Bankhead nigga ask for?
I will respect a hustle if you earn from it
A mistakes worth makin' if you can learn from it
I knew the sun was for sure coming
When a nigga called himself a killer but they nosey as an old woman
We had a problem, we just stole on him
And nowadays niggas found a way but no one told on 'em
He got a dub, hope they give him some parole on it
Everything glitter ain't got gold on it
Okay, now, everybody know that we don't play around
That boy be pillow-talking, beware, what you say around him
And Vera Wang and McQueen, I got nice things
Started serving these suckers 'round nineteen
I don't give a damn 'bout what you think you might seen
Look, you better clean your eyes, get some Visine
What can I say that you have not seen
Been on a cannonball run at the bag going high speed
Stop at nothing if you're out for somethin'
And my momma couch stuffed with stacks of hundreds
Safe deposit box, it's for my childrens' colleges
If you ever start a business, you won't go to college

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for a safe
Made way more money than mistakes
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great
All in a day's work
Man, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus: T.I.]
You can't talk to me, homie, I suggest you send your boss to me, homie
Man, what can I say?
In the Dawn with the top down on it, ducking suckers tryna block my moment
Man, what can I say?
And you gon' be mad when I get her
Sad when you found out I hit her
Man, what can I say?
I promise, it don't get no realer
Forever, been a stand up nigga
Man, what can I say?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Walk it how you talk it, play it how it go
Learn to peep a fuck nigga with your eyes closed
Learn to turn your neighborhood from a eye sore
The real-estate people wanna come and buy more
In the trap, with a trap door
If the task force come, I'll be gone before you open that door
Gold bar buy 'em off shore
Well, you can save yourself some money on the taxes but it cost more (What?)
Lawyer doing deals on the golf course
You catch a charge, they can get it tossed for you
Throw it out, nevermind what the outcome is
You're missing game, how you listen with your mouth running
I done forever had the South running
Went to New York and hollered Bankhead, they respect where I'm comin'
From, I don't give a damn, give me my money
The country niggas over there, shawty, I'm a southern
Don't let nobody give you nothin' you ain't earn from 'em
'Less you finessing for some bags and you swerve on 'em
Forever kickin' shit, you'd think a turd on me
How you come out your fuckin' face? You got some nerve, homie
I'm only living for the rare moment
Like the time you deliver for your kid, with your word on it
When you the king and your reputation stay clean even when they try to throw dirt on it

[Chorus: T.I.]
Man, what can I say?
I was just another nigga from the town
Tryin' to find a way to get paid
Man, what can I say? (What?)
Big body, 100 thousand dollar car
I pull up in new one, every day
Man, what can I say?
I'm getting too much cake for safe
Made way more money than a mistake
Man, what can I say?
Went from a young nigga to a whole great

41,Free Bird,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change

As I am strolling down the garden path
I saw a flower glowing in the dark
It looked so pretty and it was unique
I had to bend down just to have a peek

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 2]
I saw you walking underneath the stars
I could not stop cause I was in a car
I am sure the distance would not be too far
If I got out and walked to where you are

[Chorus]
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again
Hello, old friend
It is really good to see you once again

[Verse 3]
An old man passed me on the street today
I thought I knew him but I could not say
I stopped to think if I could place his frame
When he tipped his hat I knew his name

44,Someone To Lay Down Beside Me,"[Verse 1]
There's somebody waiting alone in the street
For someone to walk up and greet
Here you are all alone in the city
Where's the one that you took to your side?
Lonely faces will stare through your eyes in the night

[Verse 2]
And they'll say
Woman, sweet woman, please come home with me
You're shining and willing and free
But your love, it's a common occurrence
Not like love that I feel in my heart
Still, you know that may be what I need

[Chorus]
Is someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Just someone to lay down beside me
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside me
You're the story of my life

[Verse 3]
Well morning is breaking, the street lights are off
The sun will soon share all the cost
Of a world that can be sort of heartless
Not like love that you feel in your heart
Still, you know that may be all you get

Is someone to lay down beside you
And even though it's not real
Just someone to lay down beside you

51,Living Next Door To Alice,"""you fucking cunts""
Sally called, when she got the word
She said 'I suppose you've heard about Alice.'
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside
And I could hardly believe my eyes
A big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

We grew up together, two kids in the park
Carved our initials deep in the bark...
Me and Alice
Now she walks to the door with her head held high
And just for a moment, I caught her eye
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice

Then Sally called back, and asked how I felt
She said 'I know how to help get over Alice.'
She said 'Now, Alice is gone, but I'm still here
And you know I've been waiting twenty four years...'
And the big limousine disappeared...

I don't why why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't wanna know
'Cause for twenty four years I've been living next door to Alice
Twenty four years, just waitin' for a chance
To tell her how I feel and maybe get a second glance
But I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice

I'm beginning to feel the pain seeing nothing but cloudy skies

You're out tonight with your new love I'm far far from your mind

If you wonder what I'm doing
Don't ask me why I don't read the news
When you walk down the streets
If you're sorry then don't feel bad
If you followed my story
Then just be glad you ain't in my shoes

57,Night Moves,"{intro}

I was a little too tall
Could've used a few pounds
Tight pants points hardly renown
She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
And points all her own sitting way up high

{hook}

Way up firm and high

Out past the cornfields where the woods got heavy
Out in the back seat of my '60 Chevy
Workin' on mysteries without any clues
Workin' on our night moves
Trying' to make some front page drive-in news
Workin' on our night moves in the summertime
In the sweet summertime

We weren't in love oh no far from it
We weren't searchin’ for some pie in the sky summit
We were just young and restless and bored
Living by the sword
And we'd steal away every chance we could
To the backroom, the alley, the trusty woods
I used her she used me
But neither one cared
We were getting our share

Workin' on our night moves
Trying to lose the awkward teenage blues
Workin' on our night moves
In the summertime
In the sweet summer time, summer time

{Bridge}

And oh the wonder
Felt the lightning
And we waited on the thunder
Waited on the thunder

I woke last night to the sound of thunder
How far off I sat and wondered
Started humming a song from 1962
Ain't it funny how the night moves
When you just don't seem to have as much to lose
Strange how the night moves
With autumn closing in

{coda}

Cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door

When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
But a drink or two is a fool proof remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me

'Cause the sun's too bright, the sky's too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day

There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait

66,The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald,"The legend lives on, from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitchee Gumee
The lake, it is said, never gives up her dead
When the skies of November turn gloomy
With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more
Than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty
That good ship and crew was a bone to be chewed
When the gales of November came early

The ship was the pride of the American side
Coming back from some mill in Wisconsin
As the big freighters go, it was bigger than most
With a crew and a captain well seasoned
Concluding some terms with a couple of steel firms
When it left fully loaded for Cleveland
And later that night when the ship's bell rang
Could it be the north wind they'd been feeling?

The wind in the wires made a tattle-tale sound
As a wave broke over the railing
And every man knew as the captain did too
Was the Witch of November come stealing
The dawn came late; the breakfast had to wait
When the gales of November came slashing
When afternoon came it was freezing rain
In the face of a hurricane west wind

When suppertime came, the old cook came on deck
Saying, ""Fellas, it's too rough to feed you.""
At seven pm, a main hatchway caved in
Said, ""Fellas, it's been good to know you.""
The captain wired in he had water coming in
The good ship and crew was in peril
And later that night when its lights went out of sight
Came the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald

Does anyone know where the love of God goes
When the waves turn the minutes to hours?
The searchers all say they'd have made Whitefish Bay
If they'd put fifteen more miles behind them
They might have split up, or they might have capsized
They may have broke deep and took water
All that remains is the faces and the names
Of the wives, the sons, the daughters

Lake Huron rolls, Superior sings
In the rooms of her ice water mansions
Old Michigan steams like a young person's dreams
The islands and bays are for sportsmen
And farther below Lake Ontario
Takes in what Lake Erie can send her
The iron boats go as the mariners all know
With the gales of November remembered

In a musty old hall in Detroit they prayed
At the Maritime Sailors' Cathedral
The church bell chimed till it rang twenty-nine times
For each man on the Edmund Fitzgerald
The legend lives on from the Chippewa on down
Of the big lake they called Gitchee Gumee

68,Spring Affair/Winter Melody,"LILY, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies' dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come.

It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan's annual dance. Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia's choir, any of Kate's pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane's pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher's Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. Lily, the caretaker's daughter, did housemaid's work for them. Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers.

Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane's pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.

""O, Mr. Conroy,"" said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, ""Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.""

""I'll engage they did,"" said Gabriel, ""but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.""

He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:

""Miss Kate, here's Mrs. Conroy.""

Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel's wife, said she must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her.

""Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I'll follow,"" called out Gabriel from the dark.

He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.

""Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?"" asked Lily.

She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.

""Yes, Lily,"" he answered, ""and I think we're in for a night of it.""

He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.

""Tell me, Lily,"" he said in a friendly tone, ""do you still go to school?""

""O no, sir,"" she answered. ""I'm done schooling this year and more.""

""O, then,"" said Gabriel gaily, ""I suppose we'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?""

The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:

""The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.""

Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.

He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.
When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket.

""O Lily,"" he said, thrusting it into her hands, ""it's Christmastime, isn't it? Just... here's a little....""

He walked rapidly towards the door.

""O no, sir!"" cried the girl, following him. ""Really, sir, I wouldn't take it.""

""Christmas-time! Christmas-time!"" said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.

The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:

""Well, thank you, sir.""

He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl's bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure.

Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies' dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her face, healthier than her sister's, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour.
They both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.

""Gretta tells me you're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate.

""No,"" said Gabriel, turning to his wife, ""we had quite enough of that last year, hadn't we? Don't you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.""

Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.

""Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,"" she said. ""You can't be too careful.""

""But as for Gretta there,"" said Gabriel, ""she'd walk home in the snow if she were let.""

Mrs. Conroy laughed.

""Don't mind him, Aunt Kate,"" she said. ""He's really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom's eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you'll never guess what he makes me wear now!""

She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.

""Goloshes!"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't. The next thing he'll buy me will be a diving suit.""

Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew's face. After a pause she asked:

""And what are goloshes, Gabriel?""

""Goloshes, Julia!"" exclaimed her sister ""Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?""

""Yes,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.""

""O, on the Continent,"" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.

Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:

""It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.""

""But tell me, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. ""Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying...""

""0, the room is all right,"" replied Gabriel. ""I've taken one in the Gresham.""

""To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate, ""by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?""

""0, for one night,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""Besides, Bessie will look after them.""

""To be sure,"" said Aunt Kate again. ""What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her lately. She's not the girl she was at all.""

Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.

""Now, I ask you,"" she said almost testily, ""where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?""

Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:

""Here's Freddy.""

At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:

""Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he's all right, and don't let him up if he's screwed. I'm sure he's screwed. I'm sure he is.""

Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.

""It's such a relief,"" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, ""that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he's here.... Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.""

A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:

""And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?""

""Julia,"" said Aunt Kate summarily, ""and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.""

""I'm the man for the ladies,"" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. ""You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----""

He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.

Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.

""God help me,"" he said, smiling, ""it's the doctor's orders.""

His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:

""O, now, Mr. Browne, I'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.""

Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:

""Well, you see, I'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: 'Now, Mary Grimes, if I don't take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.'""

His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane's pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.

A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:

""Quadrilles! Quadrilles!""

Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:

""Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!""

""O, here's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,"" said Mary Jane. ""Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that'll just do now.""

""Three ladies, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate.

The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.

""O, Miss Daly, you're really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we're so short of ladies tonight.""

""I don't mind in the least, Miss Morkan.""

""But I've a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor. I'll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.""

""Lovely voice, lovely voice!"" said Aunt Kate.

As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.

""What is the matter, Julia?"" asked Aunt Kate anxiously. ""Who is it?""

Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:

""It's only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.""

In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.

""Good-evening, Freddy,"" said Aunt Julia.

Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel.

""He's not so bad, is he?"" said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.

Gabriel's brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:

""O, no, hardly noticeable.""

""Now, isn't he a terrible fellow!"" she said. ""And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year's Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.""

Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:

""Now, then, Teddy, I'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.""

Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins' attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins' left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress. Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him.

Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page.

Gabriel's eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl. Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes' heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.

He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped.

Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.

When they had taken their places she said abruptly:

""I have a crow to pluck with you.""

""With me?"" said Gabriel.

She nodded her head gravely.

""What is it?"" asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.

""Who is G. C.?"" answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.

Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:

""O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?""

""Why should I be ashamed of myself?"" asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile.

""Well, I'm ashamed of you,"" said Miss Ivors frankly. ""To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton.""

A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel's face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey's on Bachelor's Walk, to Web's or Massey's on Aston's Quay, or to O'Clohissey's in the bystreet. He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.

When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:

""Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.""

When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:

""O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she'd come. She's from Connacht, isn't she?""

""Her people are,"" said Gabriel shortly.

""But you will come, won't you?"" said Miss Ivors, laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm.

""The fact is,"" said Gabriel, ""I have just arranged to go----""

""Go where?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so----""

""But where?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,"" said Gabriel awkwardly.

""And why do you go to France and Belgium,"" said Miss Ivors, ""instead of visiting your own land?""

""Well,"" said Gabriel, ""it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.""

""And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with -- Irish?"" asked Miss Ivors.

""Well,"" said Gabriel, ""if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.""

Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.

""And haven't you your own land to visit,"" continued Miss Ivors, ""that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?""

""0, to tell you the truth,"" retorted Gabriel suddenly, ""I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!""

""Why?"" asked Miss Ivors.

Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.

""Why?"" repeated Miss Ivors.

They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:

""Of course, you've no answer.""

Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:

""West Briton!""

When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit's eyes.

He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:

""Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.""

""All right,"" said Gabriel.

""She's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.""

""Were you dancing?"" asked Gabriel.

""Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?""

""No row. Why? Did she say so?""

""Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He's full of conceit, I think.""

""There was no row,"" said Gabriel moodily, ""only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn't.""

His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.

""O, do go, Gabriel,"" she cried. ""I'd love to see Galway again.""

""You can go if you like,"" said Gabriel coldly.

She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:

""There's a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.""

While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.

Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table!

He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: ""One feels that one is listening to a thought- tormented music."" Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack."" Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?

A murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia's -- Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer's face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia's face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him.

""I was just telling my mother,"" he said, ""I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That's the truth. Upon my word and honour that's the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never.""

Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience:

""Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!""

He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:

""Well, Browne, if you're serious you might make a worse discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here. And that's the honest truth.""

""Neither did I,"" said Mr. Browne. ""I think her voice has greatly improved.""

Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:

""Thirty years ago I hadn't a bad voice as voices go.""

""I often told Julia,"" said Aunt Kate emphatically, ""that she was simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.""

She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face.

""No,"" continued Aunt Kate, ""she wouldn't be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o'clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?""

""Well, isn't it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?"" asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.

Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:

""I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it's not just, Mary Jane, and it's not right.""

She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:

""Now, Aunt Kate, you're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.""

Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:

""O, I don't question the pope's being right. I'm only a stupid old woman and I wouldn't presume to do such a thing. But there's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia's place I'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his face...""

""And besides, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane, ""we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.""

""And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,"" added Mr. Browne.

""So that we had better go to supper,"" said Mary Jane, ""and finish the discussion afterwards.""

On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time.

""But only for ten minutes, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy. ""That won't delay you.""

""To take a pick itself,"" said Mary Jane, ""after all your dancing.""

""I really couldn't,"" said Miss Ivors.

""I am afraid you didn't enjoy yourself at all,"" said Mary Jane hopelessly.

""Ever so much, I assure you,"" said Miss Ivors, ""but you really must let me run off now.""

""But how can you get home?"" asked Mrs. Conroy.

""O, it's only two steps up the quay.""

Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:

""If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I'll see you home if you are really obliged to go.""

But Miss Ivors broke away from them.

""I won't hear of it,"" she cried. ""For goodness' sake go in to your suppers and don't mind me. I'm quite well able to take care of myself.""

""Well, you're the comical girl, Molly,"" said Mrs. Conroy frankly.

""Beannacht libh,"" cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase.

Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase.

At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair.

""Where is Gabriel?"" she cried. ""Where on earth is Gabriel? There's everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!""

""Here I am, Aunt Kate!"" cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, ""ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.""

A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.

Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.

""Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?"" he asked. ""A wing or a slice of the breast?""

""Just a small slice of the breast.""

""Miss Higgins, what for you?""

""O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.""

While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane's idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other's heels, getting in each other's way and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter.

When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:

""Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.""

A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.

""Very well,"" said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, ""kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.""

He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily's removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor, a dark- complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.

""Have you heard him?"" he asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table.

""No,"" answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly.

""Because,"" Freddy Malins explained, ""now I'd be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.""

""It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,"" said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table.

""And why couldn't he have a voice too?"" asked Freddy Malins sharply. ""Is it because he's only a black?""

Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin -- Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.

""Oh, well,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, ""I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.""

""Where are they?"" asked Mr. Browne defiantly.

""In London, Paris, Milan,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly. ""I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.""

""Maybe so,"" said Mr. Browne. ""But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.""

""O, I'd give anything to hear Caruso sing,"" said Mary Jane.

""For me,"" said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, ""there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of him.""

""Who was he, Miss Morkan?"" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely.

""His name,"" said Aunt Kate, ""was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man's throat.""

""Strange,"" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. ""I never even heard of him.""

""Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,"" said Mr. Browne. ""I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he's too far back for me.""

""A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,"" said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm.

Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia's making and she received praises for it from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.

""Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,"" said Mr. Browne, ""that I'm brown enough for you because, you know, I'm all brown.""

All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor's care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.

""And do you mean to say,"" asked Mr. Browne incredulously, ""that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?""

""O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave."" said Mary Jane.

""I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,"" said Mr. Browne candidly.

He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.

""That's the rule of the order,"" said Aunt Kate firmly.

""Yes, but why?"" asked Mr. Browne.

Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:

""I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?""

""The coffin,"" said Mary Jane, ""is to remind them of their last end.""

As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:

""They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.""

The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair.

The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door. People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.

He began:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.""

""No, no!"" said Mr. Browne.

""But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion.

""Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the recipients -- or perhaps, I had better say, the victims -- of the hospitality of certain good ladies.""

He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:

""I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid -- and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come -- the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.""

A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through Gabriel's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.""

""Hear, hear!"" said Mr. Browne loudly.

""But yet,"" continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, ""there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.

""Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of -- what shall I call them? -- the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.""

The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.

""He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,"" said Mary Jane.

Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:

""Ladies and Gentlemen.

""I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.""

Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:

""Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.""

All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:

For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
Which nobody can deny.

Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:

Unless he tells a lie
Unless he tells a lie.

Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:

For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
For they are jolly gay fellows
Which nobody can deny.

The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.

The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:

""Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.""

""Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane.

""Browne is everywhere,"" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.

Mary Jane laughed at her tone.

""Really,"" she said archly, ""he is very attentive.""

""He has been laid on here like the gas,"" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, ""all during the Christmas.""

She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:

""But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn't hear me.""

At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.

""Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,"" he said.

Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:

""Gretta not down yet?""

""She's getting on her things, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate.

""Who's playing up there?"" asked Gabriel.

""Nobody. They're all gone.""

""O no, Aunt Kate,"" said Mary Jane. ""Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet.""

""Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,"" said Gabriel.

Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:

""It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.""

""I'd like nothing better this minute,"" said Mr. Browne stoutly, ""than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.""

""We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,"" said Aunt Julia sadly.

""The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,"" said Mary Jane, laughing.

Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.

""Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?"" asked Mr. Browne.

""The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,"" explained Gabriel, ""commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.""

""O, now, Gabriel,"" said Aunt Kate, laughing, ""he had a starch mill.""

""Well, glue or starch,"" said Gabriel, ""the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman's mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.""

""The Lord have mercy on his soul,"" said Aunt Kate compassionately.

""Amen,"" said Gabriel. ""So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.""

Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel's manner and Aunt Kate said:

""O, now, Gabriel, he didn't live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was there.""

""Out from the mansion of his forefathers,"" continued Gabriel, ""he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.""

Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others.

""Round and round he went,"" said Gabriel, ""and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. 'Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can't understand the horse!""

The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions.

""I could only get one cab,"" he said.

""O, we'll find another along the quay,"" said Gabriel.

""Yes,"" said Aunt Kate. ""Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught.""

Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody's laughter:

""Do you know Trinity College?""

""Yes, sir,"" said the cabman.

""Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,"" said Mr. Browne, ""and then we'll tell you where to go. You understand now?""

""Yes, sir,"" said the cabman.

""Make like a bird for Trinity College.""

""Right, sir,"" said the cabman.

The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus.

Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man's voice singing.

He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.

The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.

""Well, isn't Freddy terrible?"" said Mary Jane. ""He's really terrible.""

Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:

O, the rain falls on my heavy locks
And the dew wets my skin
My babe lies cold...

""O,"" exclaimed Mary Jane. ""It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he wouldn't sing all the night. O, I'll get him to sing a song before he goes.""

""O, do, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate.

Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.

""O, what a pity!"" she cried. ""Is he coming down, Gretta?""

Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan.

""O, Mr. D'Arcy,"" cried Mary Jane, ""it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.""

""I have been at him all the evening,"" said Miss O'Callaghan, ""and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.""

""O, Mr. D'Arcy,"" said Aunt Kate, ""now that was a great fib to tell.""

""Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?"" said Mr. D'Arcy roughly

He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.

""It's the weather,"" said Aunt Julia, after a pause.

""Yes, everybody has colds,"" said Aunt Kate readily, ""everybody.""

""They say,"" said Mary Jane, ""we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.""

""I love the look of snow,"" said Aunt Julia sadly.

""So do I,"" said Miss O'Callaghan. ""I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.""

""But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,"" said Aunt Kate, smiling.

Mr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.

""Mr. D'Arcy,"" she said, ""what is the name of that song you were singing?""

""It's called The Lass of Aughrim,"" said Mr. D'Arcy, ""but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?""

""The Lass of Aughrim,"" she repeated. ""I couldn't think of the name.""

""It's a very nice air,"" said Mary Jane. ""I'm sorry you were not in voice tonight.""

""Now, Mary Jane,"" said Aunt Kate, ""don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him annoyed.""

Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:

""Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.""

""Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!""

""Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia.""

""O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.""

""Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy. Good-night, Miss O'Callaghan.""

""Good-night, Miss Morkan.""

""Good-night, again.""

""Good-night, all. Safe home.""

""Good-night. Good night.""

The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.

She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.

She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:

""Is the fire hot, sir?""

But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well. He might have answered rudely.

A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all their souls' tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her then he had said: ""Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?""

Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:

""Gretta!""

Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at him....

At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.

As the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said:

""They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.""

""I see a white man this time,"" said Gabriel.

""Where?"" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy.

Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.

""Good-night, Dan,"" he said gaily.

When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy's protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:

""A prosperous New Year to you, sir.""

""The same to you,"" said Gabriel cordially.

She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good- night. She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.

An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.

The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.

""Eight,"" said Gabriel.

The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.

""We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,"" he added, pointing to the candle, ""you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.""

The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to.

A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:

""Gretta!""

She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.

""You looked tired,"" he said.

""I am a little,"" she answered.

""You don't feel ill or weak?""

""No, tired: that's all.""

She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:

""By the way, Gretta!""

""What is it?""

""You know that poor fellow Malins?"" he said quickly.

""Yes. What about him?""

""Well, poor fellow, he's a decent sort of chap, after all,"" continued Gabriel in a false voice. ""He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he's not a bad fellow, really.""

He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood.

""When did you lend him the pound?"" she asked, after a pause.

Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:

""O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.""

He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.

""You are a very generous person, Gabriel,"" she said.

Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.

He stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:

""Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?""

She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:

""Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?""

She did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:

""O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.""

She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:

""What about the song? Why does that make you cry?""

She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice.

""Why, Gretta?"" he asked.

""I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.""

""And who was the person long ago?"" asked Gabriel, smiling.

""It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,"" she said.

The smile passed away from Gabriel's face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.

""Someone you were in love with?"" he asked ironically.

""It was a young boy I used to know,"" she answered, ""named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He was very delicate.""

Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.

""I can see him so plainly,"" she said, after a moment. ""Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them -- an expression!""

""O, then, you are in love with him?"" said Gabriel.

""I used to go out walking with him,"" she said, ""when I was in Galway.""

A thought flew across Gabriel's mind.

""Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?"" he said coldly.

She looked at him and asked in surprise:

""What for?""

Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:

""How do I know? To see him, perhaps.""

She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.

""He is dead,"" she said at length. ""He died when he was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?""

""What was he?"" asked Gabriel, still ironically.

""He was in the gasworks,"" she said.

Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.

He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.

""I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,"" he said.

""I was great with him at that time,"" she said.

Her voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:

""And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?""

""I think he died for me,"" she answered.

A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.

""It was in the winter,"" she said, ""about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.""

She paused for a moment and sighed.

""Poor fellow,"" she said. ""He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.""

""Well; and then?"" asked Gabriel.

""And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.""

She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:

""Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother's house in Nuns' Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn't see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.""

""And did you not tell him to go back?"" asked Gabriel.

""I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.""

""And did he go home?"" asked Gabriel.

""Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!""

She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.

She was fast asleep.

Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.

Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt's supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.

The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live.

Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.

A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.",James Joyce,1976,"[70, 80]",2

Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress

A broken man with empty hands

74,Happier,"[Intro]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 1]
When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Verse 2]
When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

[Bridge]
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

[Chorus]
Then only for a minute (Only for a minute)
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me (Right to me)
I wanna raise your spirits (Wanna raise your spirits)
I want to see you smile but
Know that means I'll have to leave

[Post-Chorus]
Know that means I'll have to leave
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

75,Open Sesame - Part 1,"I think the game changed, no profits to eat but i'm keeping the same name
I'm a butane huffing lamebrain hocking loogies in your mainframe
My parents claim i wasn't an accident, i guess i was just a bad desicion
Bitcoin statistician, verbal surgical precision

About my steam like a percolator, hurdle over hurtful haters
Murder players, burgle freighters, perpetual perpetrator
Purple flavored herbal vapors flexing in a thermal blazer
I was raised in arkham, slit my throat with occam's razor

Play the part of pc pirate, yelling free pussy riot
My shit is hotter than a middle eastern climate, violent
I'm immature, i avoid responsibility like pontious pilate
(plane sound) i'm fly to death like an unconscious pilot

I don't eat pieces of shit for breakfast, the food pantry don't got those
I try my best, but ended up with minimum wage at mcdonalds
Goddamn i miss my dead friend, shout out to laura
I'm in these streets but it's a dead end, wear a mask like majora

Still lower class, i frequent the thrift shop out of necessity
Aladdin on the magic carpet, tell the pussy open sesame
Your words ain't stressin me, no poker face jokers get buried
Irony is dead, bitch it's meme cemetery

[Hook] [?]

My mental resembles hiroshima, katrina, fukushima and chernobyl
Antisocial but i'm still going global, so stare and ogle
I turn the beat anthropomorphic, chick euphoric, she believes in no god
She's only on her knees if it's for blowjobs

[Spoken]
And I think it's okay for me to include lyrics about a girl sucking my dick, because..
I'll always return the favour and eat her pussy out!
Because I want her to feel good too, you know?
It's not all about me, you know...
It's about both of us feeling happy.. and having a good time...
You know, I just want everyone to have a good time

She's touchin on the dick like nixon's mortician
I'm pitching pilots with violence write this i'm ill sneezin and sniffin
With the pinnocchio nose i flow cold and sicker than sinuses
Cuz this is hip-hop and these fuccbois should know what time it is

[Hook] [?]

I hate myself and want to die, i'd rate myself a 1.5
My gun cocked at the mirror if it ricochets then one boy dies
I'm talking to my shattered selfie, elephant it's you and i
Considered suicide, but fuck it, i'll just pursue the lie

I'm a sadboy unironically but fuck it, happy rappy
Another self-deprecating white rapper, internet get at me
I'm walking paradox, bitch i'm lachrymose whimsy
Bout to kill myself but first i'm taking 15 beats with me

76,Every Face Tells A Story,"There's no need for you to tell me
I can see the way you feel
I just know without you saying
What is a lie and what's real

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

Something's going on, and I know it
You can't keep it from me
Your smile cannot hide what you feel inside
And I don't like what I see

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories

If you want to leave me, leave me
No good living a lie
You can pretend that we're not gonna end
But your eyes are saying goodbye

Every face tells a story
It's hard to hide a lie
Every face tells a story
And yours is saying goodbye

You're always telling stories
You're always telling me lies
You're always telling stories

Tell me, I got a right to know
Pour your little heart out to me, baby
You know, you know I don't want to let go

Every face tells a story

77,"Baby, You Look Good To Me Tonight","Ive been out on this highway now
Five days in a row
My words all run together
My feet are movin slow
Ive got to stop and eat
While its still light
Theres a local angel sitting on my right
Do you believe in love at first sight
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Im ordinarily very shy
And Id be polite if I had time
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Tomorrow, Ill be good and gone
Please dont make me wait that long
Baby, you look good to me tonight

I get off at eleven, she said
And walked away
She poured a cup of coffee and
She brought it on a tray
She said, It would be nice if you could stay
Youre the best idea Ive had all day
Usually I put up a fight but
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Well Im ordinarily very shy
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I thought I must be in a dream
When she asked me if I wanted cream
Baby, you look good to me tonight

All in all you know
Its not a bad life on the road
If youve got wheels to roll
And lucky stars above
Your destinys your own
You go as far as you can go
And if theres time to sleep
Theres time to make love

I came, I saw, I conquered
But I rode off in the sun
But I know the look she left with me
Keeps telling me she won
Her face is the only thing I see
Whispering those words of prophesy

I may come easy, but I dont come free
Youre never gonna see the last of me
Baby, you look good to me tonight
I was born to love you now can't you see
Baby, you look good to me tonight
Im ordinarily very shy
But I take the time to satisfy
Baby, you look good to me tonight

And wasted all my time
You could have got me mad girl
And made me lose my mind
But you did what you have to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you

It makes me very proud baby
To know that you're my girl
I want to say it loud baby
I want to tell the world
That you did what you had to do
And every word you said to me was true
You gave me what I asked for
And I can't ask for anymore than you
I've got everything a man could need
Oh I feel just like a slave that has been freed
I won't cry myself to sleep no more
'Cause I've found the love that I've been looking for

Now I don't have a problem
'Cause I know who I am
You see I lost my only problem
When you made me your man

[Intro: Paddy]
Look

[Verse 1: Paddy]
Why you acting rude?
Acting like you got something to prove
You got ties in the end, I been cutting them loose
First ever clash I was boss in a suit
But check one, check two
Back in the booth
Badmind me? Nah, I'm not in the mood
Stating facts, nothing to lose
Speak to the streets and guide the youth, look
I don't care if you're bursting iron
We love the jungle deep, we're lions
I met truth, I met liars
I met real badman, I met criers
You're not bad 'cause your name's on flyers
Ends are riddled with drugs and buyers
Witness murders, creating riots
Parents moaning, their children dying

[Verse 2: Saint P]
You must have meant sex in the soil
When you said that you done dirt
Your girl says I'm a little childish, calls me a cunt
But it's all fun, make sure that I beat her cunt first
He said, she saids, fuck that, bun you, bun her
Kill 'em with one verse, I dun her
My nice browning with a bumper
Thought she could handle the heat, now she's sunburnt
Your girl's got a good body
But if she don't tick all of my boxes, I don't even want her
So don't watch me, that's not your concern
Said you're gonna gun buck me, when you bucked me
You were just stuttering, ""um, er, um, er, um, er""
You don't back beef, you bun first
No CDs, blank sheets, you ain't done work
Clap like thunder inside man's [?]

[Verse 3: Angry]
Yo, real life, my brudda
Could get cut with a knife, my brudda
Fuck that, man can't diss my brudda
Fuck that, man can't diss my mudda
Man like Angry, I don't move shooker
Death round the corner, life get tooken
Twos in the booker, sick little fucker
This little man's still wiving hookers
When I didn't have a pound to my name
Still smack gyal that are overly [?]
Land on sets, it's more than gully
And man need more than money
But I still need more, more money
You seem them honeys? Overly slutty
She thinks I'm piff

And the [?]

Okay, so you wanna test the 'Bré
Man get left in a fucked up way
Chalk line ting like Merky ACE
Yuck, yuck, mud in the face
Man wanna war me? World War 3
Better pray to God that something stops me
Mind out 'fore your face get ugly
Ting in the pouch, yeah, man are jumpy
On the roads from '06, man ah know me
Pagan King on the roads, don't sleep
Little PK's been about from way back
When I used to wake up bare early
To watch the TV
Fuck that, now man are going on greaze
Kill an MC for the Ps, it's easy for me
Guarantee man are gonna D-I-E, E

[Verse 5: Dialect]
Right, how many more times can it be wartime?
It's alright 'cause I'm on this all night
I was given this gift, foresight
That ting and this spliff, all spice
Fuck around, get Bruce like Foresyth
Full of raw lines, eight balls when you snort white
Red Bull just gave me the fall guy
Should've given man MIST, he's more grime
I'm from the North side, yeah I rep for them
Gave me London, I ain't impressed with them
You man are showing names like testament
But still in a rave, getting waved like Mexicans
What'd you know about Grime-A-Side?
I'm the guy that clashed with Elijah Eyez
Kept Grime alive, still got a 9-to-5
Don't come around here, try rhyme with Di

[Verse 6: AJ Tracey]
I thought that he came with the bars but he never
Big impact like Ross or Heather
Man mind out when I'm strapped with the leather
Told man already that we've got the pumpy
Dump it, niggas'll fly like feather
Mandem think that I just turned bad
I was bad from when I chilled by Mo Better
Strap put man in a peak dilemma
Don't bell man off of unknown, bredda
White and bold, six feet in the North Face
Gym shoes? Nah, I do not shot cheddar
You're not bad, bad yout? Never
West Indies strap, hold bare pepper
True Religions and a Polish pistol
Skengman dance, I'm a real hotstepper

He's not a badman, neither are you
Stop with the lies and stick to the truth
Compose yourself, you're talking loose
Semtex bars, I'm strapped with a boom
Tiocfaidh ár lá, they don't have a clue
I'm a rebel inside and out of the booth
I was built for this, I can't lose
You ain't got half the heart, you'll get moved
Put in your place if you wanna get rude
You're only known in your ends as a dude
I'm doing fine, been doing grime
I make joy in the fruits of life
They could never try take what's mine
Leave them shook like a deer in lights
Deeper than hearts on sleeves and pride
Body get taken out with the tide

[Verse 8: Saint P]
Listen, I'm Sai-de-de-de-daint-de-daint-de-daint
Yeah, I've got pattern
My one's the first and my one's the classic
I don't wanna hear no bars about stars
These man are not blessed in ends and that's tragic
I ain't gotta gas it
You'll hold a box like a package
If you chat shit, boom, on automatic mode
I make you panic and sweat
Bet you pray you're my brudda
Like I got a bally and dreads
You ain't got heart, I know you're gonna panic
When you're in beef, how comes you don't back it?
You're a likkle side dish, you're a likkle coleslaw
You're a likkle salad
I just want peas, bread, cheese and carrots, yeah
That's my kind of a sandwich
That's my kind of a-

Yo, you ain't got one chance to win
Pack you in, after the clash, catch you in
The drinking area, glass your chin
Now this ain't gonna be no clash with him
Game over, I'ma take you out the ring
Your gyal's down for a ting, she got down on my ting
You ain't down for shit
You're on a sadman ting, and you sound like him
You're a pussy, don't try jump on the mic
You're a pussy, don't try jump on the hype
I'll actually murk this guy
You sound weird with them virgin rhymes

Get murked on site, best turn to the light
Catch your soul before it takes flight

Yo, I got a million ways to kill you, choose one
Come on the mic, you'll get bun
Cooked like a hot croissant from France
I spray my bars to lick down the dance real fast
Fast like racing cars
And in my bars, I've got the answer
Trust me fam, I've got the secret
To make the sound work on a track or the tune
I spray my bars I murk
Yuck, I am the teacher
They wanna know how I swerve on the riddim and serve
You need to practice, you need to learn
Come against me, best do your research
Or get left on the dirt
October the 18th, trust me, fam
Yeah, man have been a dan from early
Yeah, man have been a dan from birth

[Verse 11: Dialect]
Alright, I live this life
Man show fear when I grips this mic
Flickering lights, glistening eyes
I rap with presence, Christmas time
Getting better with age like vintage wine
No food left 'cause I did this right
Get pissed with guys that are [?] it's time
To kill 'em becah I spin 'em like a discuss flying
Like, like, oh my
Seems nowadays that everyone's grime
Everyone's lying, there's never been any one time
That you rep for the style that everyone's trying
You got food, but is anyone buying?
Thinking they trap 'cause you're selling one-fives
Food that you've got, I'll get it, now they want hype up
Against Di, nigga, you will get one strike

[Verse 12: AJ Tracey]
Ladbroke Grove is where I re- who?
Man get burst up in the G- who?
Came back with a fresh one, it's new
Don't come around for a two of the blue
I don't give a fuck if you're old or new
I'll just yawn like ""blackball who?""
Put a couple dead MCs in the grave
Like Dialect, trust, you can go there too
Trust me, darg, you can go there free
I don't ever watch F-A-C-E

82,Year Of The Cat,"{Instrumental Lead In}

On a morning from a Bogart movie
In a country where they turn back time
You go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre
Contemplating a crime
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress running
Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the Year of the Cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The Year of the Cat

Well She looks at you so coolly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in Incense and Patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside
The Year of the Cat

{Instrumental Bridge}

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice and lost your ticket
So you have to stay on
But the drum-beat strains of the night remain
In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay
In the Year of the Cat

Than I've been before
Than I've been before

You're my driving wheel
You keep me groovin', baby
Just one touch
Just one touch
Opens up my door
Opens up my door",The Supremes,1976,"[85, 87, 89, 93]",4
84,Heart On My Sleeve,"[Verse]
Six feet deep, I've been under the water
Go and tell your top five I'm goin' harder
The one thing that I would never fuck with is karma
If it's war, I got a trunk full of armor
I'm the illest, I feel like I might kill 'em in any minute
So I'm spittin' out venom at anyone who wanna get it
Definition of realism, If I say it then I live it
Man, I've been in the system since I was little sippin' guinness
I'm a certified rockstar, I'm authentic
R.I.P. John Lennon, he gave me guitar lessons
I'm in Greece eating bak-la-va all winter
In the streets with the Ras-tas, who want get it
I don't get blinded by the fame and the money
In 2019 I'll be the face of my country
So hate if you a hater, but the hatin' disgustin'
I'm lookin' down on 'em like ""Ey, little buddy""
Self-made, I'm trynna change for the better
Y'all too busy worried 'bout a name on your sweater
Boy, I came with my gang and we sprayin' berettas
Y'all aim for the legs, and we aim for the neck-up
You verse us, ain't a good idea
I see you got your style at the hood IKEA
If you're lookin' for the truth you can look right here
'Cause we the shit now, we ain't about to go nowhere
When it's beef then my team on the front line
And they willin' and ready to squeeze when it's crunch time
Where I'm from you get punched over punchlines
I fall asleep to the sound of the gunfire
Raise a toast, the occasion is special
Suit and tie on, but I came from the ghetto
Hear the kick, then the snare, then the bass, then the treble
I used to smoke weed, now I blaze instrumentals

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve, my heart on my sleeve

[Verse 2]
Please name a rapper that actually want beef
Boy, I'm a pitbull and y'all just Maltese
So watch what you say cause I'm on a small leash
I'ma pull it out and shoot, I got it in arms reach
Catch a shot to the chest, I'm stoppin' your heart beat
Man, this shit to you a hobby, I'm at it like all week
I'm way bigger than you, go get in my car seat
Man, my price too high and all of your talk cheap
I'm an asshole and they tell me life a gamble
I bet it all with my cash low
Bitch, I've been in this game since Hasbro
I'm on fire taking shots of tabasco
I ain't never gonna give up, from get it I get you lit up
While you're lyin', we gorillas, you lookin' like little Simbas
I'm doing ab crunches and cardio with my chin ups
I've been eating these rappers and dippin' that shit in ketchup
Y'all goofs and the proofs in the put in
This shit's so hard, I'm in the booth with the Woody
I said it then I met it then these dudes couldn't stood it
All my crews wearing camos from the shoes to the hoodie
But it's risk too much too much to lose it all over nothin'
Went from fisticuffs, now I'm not with the fuck shit
They tough online but it's not that in public
It's Stompdown Killaz and it's not for discussion
So I sit back chillin' tryna analyze life
For the life of my team I would sacrifice mine
Real shit, I got 'em lookin' at me funny
Cause I did it for my family and it wasn't for the money
So I push it to the limit, I can feel it in my stomach
I don't do it cause I can
Man, I do it cause I love it
I'm going out with a bang now
Fuck it, I'm worried 'bout the culture
You worried bout money..

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me, I'ma do me
Put my life on the line, I'ma ride for my team
Been through the ups and the downs
I'm still in these streets
Keep my ears to the ground
And my heart on my sleeve, my heart on my sleeve",Merkules,1976,"[86, 90, 67, 90, 69, 79, 83, 87, 88, 91, 93]",11
85,Carry On Wayward Son,"[Chorus]
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 1]
Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say

[Chorus]
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more

[Verse 2]
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man, well
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say

[Chorus]
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry no more
No!

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Carry on, you will always remember
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
But surely heaven waits for you

[Chorus]
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry
Don't you cry no more

[Guitar Solo Outro]
No more!",Kansas,1976,[87],1
86,When Love Is New,"When love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation

When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

Don't let our love grow old
'Cause funny things happen
Then that love gets cold

So let's me and you make a pact
A promise to each other
For as long as we live
Long as we love, let's always

Always keep our love brand new
'Cause love is so wonderful
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

I said when love is new
Every day's a new sensation
When love is new
You thrill with infatuation

When love is born
(When it's born)
It's so warm, soft and tender
(So warm, soft)
Everybody's willing to surrender

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new, when love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
It's so wonderful, marvelous, thrilling, serious

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
Every day is a new sensation
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)

Warm, soft, tender
When love is new
(When love is new, when it's new)
When love, when love is new
We want always to be together",Billy Paul,1976,[88],1

89,White Bird,"[Verse 1]
White bird in a golden cage
On a winter's day, in the rain
White bird in a golden cage
Alone

The leaves blow across the long black road
To the darkened sky, in its rage
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Unknown

White bird must fly, or she will die

White bird dreams of the aspen trees
With their dying leaves turning gold
But the white bird just sits in her cage
Growing old

White bird must fly, or she will die [x2]

The sunsets come, the sunsets go
The clouds roll by, the Earth turns slow
The young bird's eyes do always glow

She must fly [x3]

[Verse 1]

White bird must fly, or she will die [x3]

90,It's A Long Way There,"Hey, everybody, yeah, don't you feel that there's something

People on their own are getting nowhere
I'm on the road to see
If anything is anywhere or waiting, just for me

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
That feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Hey, everybody, don't you feel that there's something
But you know in a moment it is gone
I live for the day when I can hear people saying
That they know and they care for everyone

But I feel like I've been here for the whole of my life
Never knowing home

It's a long way, it's a long, long, long way there
I'm gonna keep on tryin', I'm gonna keep on tryin', yeah
I'm gonna keep on tryin', keep on tryin'

Been away from home for such a long time
And got to know this town
But I don't seem to matter much to anyone who's around
Is there anybody around

Everynight I walk around the city
Seems like I'll never know
The feeling of being together when I go

And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going
And it's a long way there
It's a long way to where I'm going

Everybody knows it's a long way there
Oh, everybody knows it's a long way there
Mmm, it's a long way

Driving around's kind of getting me down and I know, and I know
It's a long long way there
It's such a long long way, long way

But you're the only one I trust to
Show me the way, I always hear your voice
And in my dreams I hear you calling my name
What is it about you?
Some kind of light shines from your face
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, I've been hypnotized
And your eyes say everything
You wanna keep me here forever
I can't escape, one minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me and I'm afraid
You don't have to say, you love me
'Cause if you want me, I'll stay
'Cause I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes
I've been taken, I've been taken and I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner captured by your eyes

This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yeah

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Verse: Drake]
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been goin' off and they don't know when it's stoppin'
And when you get to toppin', I see that you've been learnin'
And when I take you shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

94,Hey Baby,"[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
I've been gone awhile away from you
And I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
Cause if I was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we have
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bare the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry you know I must do what I must do

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Bridge: Stephen Marley] (Mos Def)
Well and it's not easy, Jah knows how I try I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain to ride and keep on rockin
From, city to city backyard to yard
And we, be seein the sites standin under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreamin and I'm holdin you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Come to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't never too far
Your the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey must start

[Hook: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
And if you thought that I was lost, I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

95,Spend Some Time,"[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say (Say)
For all the fools who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road, and now I'm back
Sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up
Where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never would've thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold?
But bitches, they gon' talk; niggas, they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart, but when someone seems
Too good to be true, they usually are, but see
When you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!"" (Fuck a bitch!)
My only motive is to get head, and fuck a bitch (Fuck a bitch!)
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this (Because of this)
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit (Other shit)
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss (Should've fed you piss)
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist, too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

Dancing through the fibers of time

Than cursed with disbelief

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

You know I'm nasty and nice, a white rapper you like
You pass me the mic, and ask for advice
Well, tell the truth, do what you said you would do
Don't, listen to fools don't, give into rules
So, dig Lef, the next level of respect
I get it from good kids and rebels on the set
I get it from the best, from the worst, from the West
From the East, from police, from the streets, from my friends
Rip it like a beast, tear the beat to shreds
Leavin opposition dead, eat their heads
When it's all said and done I want peace instead
I'm nice, I want the right things to reach the kids
I'm nasty, like lapdances and trash can lids
Like the image of America for Afghan kids
I'm nice like an ocean cruise or mountain views
I'm nasty, like eatin cornflakes with Mountain Dew
Hot like glue, keep my cool like Sneaux shoes
Fuck with MPC's, SP's and Pro Tools
I know, you know, they know too, it's so true
Lefco is so new, the rest is old news

Yeah you know, the work of poet, gettin you open
The crop reportin and the hoein, raw emotion
The song's in motion and out of focus
I'm nasty like halitosis, or have you noticed? I'm braggadocious
I spit potion, in heavy doses
That's the leading cause of jealous notions in weak opponents
Keep me posted, I like to know when I'm hated
I might get a kick out of it after I'm famous
I'm nice like old neighbors, white like rolling papers
Alright let's place a wager, I'm tight, you know the flavor
Some cats are overrated, that's an understatement
Amen, I'm in the basement with innovation
See Jake left flows for motivation insanity
I don't care for hoes, ovations or vanity
Can he be so nasty and so classy?
You know he can be, baby please don't ask me
Big ups to Happ G, Snuffman, get at me
Doc know exactly what I'm talkin about
Out nights touchin mics with the rowdy types
I think without rap I'd live a lousy life
It sounds nice, with a downright nasty spice
Blame ignorance the first time, don't ask me twice

[Chorus]

I come off like double G bras and leopard print drawers
Off of porn stars, cause you are lost if you miss it
Like brickin free throws at the finish
You're panic stricken, you put yourself in that position, why?
You'll say I'm nice and nasty, quite crafty
Try to blast me your lyrics whistle right past me
Don't ask me to break it down, I'm done repeatin myself
Listen, let the words speak for themselves
Now, how could you question my dedication without
Even, hearin me out like you know what I'm about
I'm proud to be a, leader, eager crowd pleaser
A speaker, make a loud speaker sound weaker
I'm all about beaver, big blunts and reefer
And leisure, snuff beats and half G heaters
I'm nice like cool teachers, nasty like leeches
Stuck on the mic spittin for all the right reason
I'm decent dawg, you musta got it all wrong
I caught you off guard, I'm nicer than you thought
You heard how I turned out the cipher at the bar?
The word's out, it turns out, I'm nicer than you are

105,Silver Heels,"[Verse 1]
She came in like a hurricane
Wearing boots and diamond rings
With a fox fur on her shoulder
She set wondering
And I could tell she was feeling abandoned
Because she flashed a look across my way
She said, ""Hop for a ride
You'll never ask me but I'll tell you anyway""

[Chorus 1]
She took me out on the blackboard jungle
Put me straight in a hurricane
She hypnotized my eyes with her silver heeled ways
If I could sing like Paul McCartney and get funky like Etta James
I'd never change, I'd never change
I'd never change silver heeled ways

[Verse 2]
She came in and her flags were flying
She was a sailboat of sweet perfume
And I could see that her eyes were smiling
From across the room
Well I couldn't think of conversation
I was busy looking at her furs
She said, ""Hey, you'll never ask me
So I guess I'll say the word""

[Chorus 1]

106,All Roads (Lead Back To You),"I walked down some dusty highways I've loved more than just a few
No one's ever matched the feeling that I've known in loving you
In the winds I've heard you whisper it has sparkled in the dew
I finally learned my destination and all my roads lead back to you

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you

I've climbed up life's highest mountain and I've come down the other side
Every rainbow ends in nothing dreams can't take you for a ride
Maybe cause I'm gettin' older or I'm finally gettin' wise
All my thoughts turn to exploring the country hidden in your eyes

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you

All my roads lead back to you

Nothing is the same since you've been gone

Knowing that you will probably never receive it
But I miss you, I walk by myself
I talk to myself, I sleep by myself
Ooh baby, I miss you

Dirty dishes in the sink, mmm, hmm
Lots of time for me to think
Didn't think, didn't think I knew the tear
It's been a week but oh, it seems like a year

This house is not the same, ooh, since you've been gone
I never thought that you would stay so long
You haven't written, woah, you never never call
I hope you're okay but that ain't all

I kinda miss you
I kinda miss you

Heard a noise, was someone else, yes, it was
Walked the dogs all by myself
I go to bed, I go to bed but I can't sleep
I'm so depressed, I can't even eat

We had a fight, woo yeah, I lost my head
I said some things I shouldn't have said
If you miss me, woo yeah, like I miss you
Come on back, come on back, let's start anew

I kinda miss you, I kinda miss you
I kinda miss you, I, you know, I miss you
I kinda miss you, mmm, hmm

Extra, extra, what's that all about?
I'm wishin' the position of my loving's sorted out
I shed a tear 'cause I'm hearin' nothing new or particular
Status once parallel, now it's perpendicular
And everything is just as clear as day
Realistically explicit in the things you say
I guess a ""bitch"" in the batter's gonna make the flavor fatter
But you gots to keep it for real
Forget about your jewels and gems
You won't be needin none of them
The tool'll fix the era
My mellow used to wear a namebuckle, now he chuckle
'Cause he earn a dime Quicker
Talkin bout a burner, sippin' on some malt liqour
And all these kiddies wishin' they were supa emcees
But to earn my ""s"", I had to learn some less
About a crime'll make million, a dime'll make a call

Hey kid, what's the word?
Man, it's all about mind
Keeping focused on them self-mechanisms of rhyme
So no longer stand erect 'cause your thoughts are drained
Walkin' round, manifesting attributes of shame
Used to squabble for the mic but now accordingly
We act unless a club can't afford the fee
We act so name that any best man to put us under
Created from the ground yet know nothing 'bout the under
Take a glimpse at them pimps playing record exec
Adding up all your OHs so's to cut you a check
Saying why the blunder wonder could've G'd today
So you can put up some swings for your seed to play
But a swing ain't that important when the park's around the corner
Filled with life causing death, greeting victims for the morning
It was the moment I feared
Nah, the moment I steered upon the right path
To know the right math to overstand

Mary is waitin' and weepin'
Down in our shack by the sea
Even after I've hurt her
Mary' still in love with me
Devil woman it's over
Trapped no more by your charms
Cause I don't want to stay, I want to get away
Woman let go of my arm

[Chorus]
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

[Verse 3]
Devil woman you're evil
Like the dark coral reef
Like the winds that bring high tides
You bring sorrow and grief
You made me ashamed to face Mary
Barely had the strength to tell
Skies are not so black, Mary took me back
Mary has broken your spell

[Chorus]
Oh, devil woman
Devil woman, let go of me
Devil woman, let me be
And leave me alone
I want to go home

[Verse 4]
Runnin' along by the seashore
Runnin' as fast as I can
Even the seagulls are happy
Glad I'm coming home again
Never again will I ever
Cause another tear to fall
Down the beach I see, what belongs to me
The one I want most of all

Bye, bye, bye, baby
I'm gonna kiss you goodbye and go right through that doorway
So long, I'm leaving
This is the last time we'll meet on the street going your way

Don't look surprised, you know you've buttered your bread
So now it's fair, you should stare at the back of my head
If you write a letter to me
My former friend, don't you end with an R.S.V.P

I'm going bye, bye, I'm moving
Tomorrow I may be splittin' to Britain or Norway

Knowing the love of your our life
Will never come again

Of that you can rely

Run up in the yard for the reddies
Brake mans vase and flip mans telly
Release all the cash before I spit that semi
Im gift-wrapped ready if called on
On the pagan block with the 4-long

Middle of December, hotter than Summer

146,(one More Year Of) Daddy's Little Girl,"Verse 1
Starting with the notion every lesson will be taught?
It ends up hitting hard when those instructions can't be bought
It caught up with me late, I never saw just how distraught
My poor lonely mother was & how viciously she fought
Before I was a thought, before my brother was conceived
She felt the loss of a child & saw her first husband leave
She was daddy's little girl who always had a need
Born in communist Cuba, my grandparent's only seed
Made it into the states back in 1958
Out in search for a life with more than just rations on a plate
I can only imagine man the struggle in those times
The hunger they had felt, the sweat they poured out for dimes
Then to touch down in a country that's so big on selling dreams
Different poison, same greed, same evil, different schemes
Escaping outta one hell, to be captured in the next
My grandpa worked himself to death to feel the paper from them check

Hook (Gemini Genesis & Rob Wade)
It's hard enough to find a grind that won't make you lose your mind without the risk of doing time so if you
HEAR ME YELL
Don't be surprised when you take a look into my eyes & you see the rage that's caged inside from the times I've
FACED THIS HELL
Will the pain ever subside?
Will the chains become untied?
Walk with me, be my guide, help me
BREAK THIS SPELL
I know you feel that hunger, don't let it take you under
Yet & still I wonder, was it easier being younger?

Verse 2
Going back to change it all? I guess there's times I wish I could have
Coming up within the streets? Not much out there that I could grab
Survival's learned by living, not from reading through what books have
So I hustled on the ave, took it all & never looked back
It was hard for me to deal, went to 3 high schools within the course of a year
Said fuck the jay's, fuck the gear, I was grinding for my next meal
Mom was on the edge, mixing sleeping pills & beer
She must've wanted to disappear
I was always on the move, getting high to stay immune
Trying not to get consumed by the pain that she was going through
Grandma in a nursing home, dementia had her withering away
Those 40s & those Ls kept me picturing the day
Where I no longer had to hide the demons killing me inside
Still with no one by my side I pushed the thoughts of suicide
I made it through the worst to be here writing down these verses
But I would go back in reverse to see my family out them hearses

We were flyin’, but we'd never get far

There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

Saw me cooking heard the baby crying
He tried sneaking into our bedroom
I came running with a swinging broom

And now he's living it down

He's living it down at his best friend's house
Down on his best friend's couch
Down on his bended knees
He's begging honey won't you forgive me
He lived it up all over town
And now he's living it down

So now he's living out of his suitcase
In a corner of his buddies place
I don't think that he can take this long
All he wants to do is come back home
He lived it up all over town
And now he's living it down

He's living it down at his best friend's house

152,Someday (I Didn't Want To Have to be the One),"Chorus
Love is blind it so blind

Verse 1
A lot of people always have love around the world but they have so many problems in their love that most relationships fail because nobody wants to try to rebuild or fix anything but, see love blinds us from the problems or seeing who the person we love or care about truly is or what they're capable of I for one am sick of people lying about major things to the people they care about like give me something real
Love exists to give you happy moments and leave the bad one's behinds
The person in front you could be the one you're meant to be with or is the one you pick yourself
But love is made for the ones you care about
Maybe someday I'll figure it out
Chrous
Love is blind it so blind

Verse 2
You were the one I wanted back in eighth grade but, I never did anything never said anything so it's my fault if you end up in someone else's arms because I didn't say anything
So I guess i will just keep going like I have for the past to see it's great to be in love but, I was blinded on what I wanted to do for 2 years until I found NF last year and he had inspired me to become a rapper last may it's been almost a year since I released a song about love but, I don't really have love or crush right now I just love my family and friends

Pre-Chorus
I honestly never want you to have fake love but, still a partner for life but, I got one cause my boy chase is my brother he's my partner and brother for life but, I still want a girl to marry and have some kids with or just the both of us spend the rest of my life with her but, I'm a figure it out

When you care about someone you are not blind but without love you are blind

I just hope I can figure out",Kurama 57,1976,"[85, 87, 89]",3

Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

Whoa, tonight it's a matter of time
I am the midnight

I'm the song when you won't dance slow dance
On a Saturday night
I'm the sleep that you need, but you don't get
On a late night drive
I am the zeros on the clock
When a hard day's done I'll be your rock
Some want me to go and some want me to stop

I'm the beginning and end
I'm full of crazy and sin
I see your timing again

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

How the shooting stars would shower the sky
While we slept covered in the dew

Memories of innocence still linger in my mind
We should cross each other's path
It's only a matter of time

If I only could have one more chance
I'd be on my bended knee
Just to look into your mystical eyes
While the wind caressed the trees

But if I only could be with you again
Under the apple trees in bloom
Just to look into your mystical eyes

You've loved all you can and now you're all loved out
Ooh ooh baby, we've been a long, long way
And who's to say where we'll be tomorrow?
Well, my heart says no, but my mind says it's so
That we got a love, is it a love to stay?

[Hook]
We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

[Verse 2]
Looking at you, I wanted to say
I think a little emotion goes a long, long way
Careful now, don't get caught in your dreams
Look out, baby, this is not what it seems
Ooh ooh baby, you've been so good to me
But please don't make it what it's not
Well, I thought we agreed on what we need
So listen to me, I'll tell you what we've got

[Hook]
We got a wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing
Wham bam shang-a-lang
And a sha-la-la-la-la-la thing

[Verse 3]
I think you're seein' what I've been sayin'
'Cause I hear you singin' to the tune I'm playin'
Now that it's said and we both understand
Let's say our goodbyes before it gets out of hand
Bye bye baby, I'd really like to stay
But we'll remember the best time in our life

164,The Raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door—
                                                Only this and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                                                Nameless here for evermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
                                                This it is and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you""—here I opened wide the door;—
                                         Darkness there and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""—
                                                Merely this and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
                                         'Tis the wind and nothing more!""

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
                                  Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
                                                Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
                                         With such name as ""Nevermore.""

But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
Till I scarcely more than muttered ""Other friends have flown before—
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
                                         Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
                                                Of 'Never—nevermore.'""

But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
                                         Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""

This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er
                                                She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""
                                                Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!""
                                                Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""
                                                Quoth the Raven ""Nevermore.""

""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting—
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
                                                Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
                                                Shall be lifted—nevermore!",Edgar Allan Poe,1976,"[91, 80, 82, 87]",4
165,Say You Love Me,"[Verse 1]
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's gettin' torn from your mistakes

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

[Verse 2]
Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time cause that's not the same
I want to feel burning flames when you say my name
I want to feel passion flow into my bones like blood through my veins

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love if you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floatin' away

Won't you stay? Won't you stay?
Slowly, slowly you unfold me
But do you know me at all?
Someone told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No-no-no-no, no, no)
If you don't wanna try

Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case

Love of my life, can't you see?

Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You've taken my love, and now desert me

And everything's all by the way

To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

Now once I flick my Bic, and the dutch get lit

You rob me tonight? You want make it to the morning
Rolled up on 'em, when this killers froze up on 'em
And I came with a whole truck for 'em
Try to tell 'em, that he got no bucks they won't bust for 'em

Sweats for longjohns, tryin' to get their warm on

Get papes, celebrate like the date I was born on
I spit blood and get love, sip Bud and flip cus
Them niggas wanna leave me twisted like the spliff does
But I react, hoes in ya head watch ya shit flood
Like Noa's Ark, blunts burnin' like Jona Fark (?)
I squeeze with ease like Tone and Mark
We (?) demolish straight from (?)
Deeper than knowledge
Equipped to speak at ya college
You kill me fronting when I'm for really coming
Carravans packed up with my mans in 'em
Cause I really want em
It's all good like Willy Hunting
Watch my diamonds glitter, I sit back and really realize
That I'm the nigga, they wanna know me
If you feel me, come show me
Is it really real? Or cause I know Pun and Joey
Yeah my shit shine my sunny Rolly
It couldn't hold me, if you was thick like Shaq or quick like Kobe
Show & A get the love, my niggas mix the ? with the Bud
Show the dirty don and mister Mud

[Intro: Drake]
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking, looking
Looking, looking
Looking
Looking

[Chorus: Drake]
Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

183,Like A Sad Song,"Usually in the morning
I'm filled with sweet belonging
And everything is beautiful to see
Even when it's raining
The sound of heaven singing
Is simply joyful music to me

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

So many different places
A million smiling faces
Life is so incredible to me
Especially to be near you
And how it is to touch you
Oh, paradise was made for you and me

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

I know that life goes on just perfectly
Everything is just the way that it should be
Still there are times when my heart feel like breaking
And anywhere is where I'd rather be

Oh, and in the nighttime
I know that it's the right time
To hold you close and say ""I love you so""
To have someone to share with
And someone I can care with
And that is why I wanted you to know

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

Sometimes I feel like a sad song
Like I'm all alone without you

184,It's O.k.,"[Hook]
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

[Verse 1]
Hey
I think I might move on to something new
But only if you say that's cool with you
Cause I love all the little things you do (I mean did)
Cause
I begged you to show up
And; I asked you to stay
You told me to grow up
So I pushed you away
I tell you ""you know what""
And; we fought once again
Then we got back together
Who's kidding who, it's a trend
Because
I like being alone 
But i don't like being lonely
I like being home 
But I don't like being homies
You know I'm so sorry
For making you feel like you lost me
We're two unstable enablers
Please try not to be salty
Because
All this time & all these tries
Leave questions open ended
& I would rather die
Than try to live with this resentment
So we could try just one more time
To make sure that we meant it
Or we could cut our losses
Before we blow up & dead it
So

[Hook]
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay (to be happy now)
Tell me it's okay (because I'm happy now)
Tell me it's okay

[Verse 2]
Hey
It's okay to say you're not okay
It's not okay to turn and walk away
We've got problems that we need to face
If you love me, then say it
If you trust me, then show it
If you don't mean it, save it
If you do mean it, own it
You gotta be happy alone
To be happy together
You gotta lose something u know
To learn how to get better
I've been working, you've been hurting
I've been curving, you've been swerving
I've been sleeping, you've been creeping
Now you got me creeped, I'm leaving
I think about you
I dream about you
I smile about you
I cry about you
I lie about you
I'm fine without you
I lied that's not true
I'd die without you
Our love is a war, we use words as our weapons
So either ur real or I'm gone in a second
These thoughts that we have & these feelings we kept in
Make resent & regret, upset & a severance 
You dont fuck with ultimatums 
Have to face it 
Loves contagious 
Also dangerous 
Leaves you damaged
Make it painless 
Now dont make sense
Tried to saved it
Please please please

185,Brand New Love Affair,"[Verse 1]
Wish I knew what was going wrong
Seems so very long since we laughed together
It's no good to be all alone
When you hurt a friend
And you both feel empty

[Chorus]
What I'd give to erase the pain
Will we ever make friends?
Is it over or shall we try again?
For a brand new love affair

[Verse 2]
Seems to me
We are both afraid
That our love may fade and we just won't make it
Maybe soon we'll be friends again
Find ourselves and then
Really make it happen

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Start all over again
And do it up the right way
Come together my friend
And celebrate the new day

188,Sunrise,"[Verse 1]
Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
""Gambino Girl forever"" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, ""Hasta luego""
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen Sandiego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin 'on him
Will he fail? Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha

[Chorus]
(Ayy!) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy!) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy

[Verse 2]
New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson, 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, no vocation
Murder verses the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah

[Chorus]
(Ayy!) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy
(Ayy!) What it do, bitch?
Why these other rappers do shit stupid?
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit
While they be sleepin', I be onto that new shit, ayy

[Outro]

190,Shower The People,"You can play the game and you
Can act out the part
Though you know it wasn't
Written for you
But tell me, how can you stand
There with your broken heart
Ashamed of playing the fool
One thing can lead to another;
It doesn't take any sacrifice
Oh, father and mother, sister and
Brother
If it feels nice, don't think twice
Just shower the people you love
With love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine
If you only will
Shower the people you love
With love
Show them the way you feel
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will

You can run but you cannot hide
This is widely known
And what you plan to do with
Your foolish pride
When you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the
Way that you feel
You can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say
About the squeaky wheel
Always getting the grease

Better to shower the people you
Love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be just fine
If you only will
Shower the people you love
With love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better
If you only will

Shower the people you love
With love
Show them the way that
You feel

You'll feel better right away
Don't take much to do
Sell you pride
They say in every life
They say the rain must fall
Just like pouring rain

Make it rain

192,Love Is Alive,"[Verse 1]
It wakes me up at night
It needs to share its light
It doesn't get how dark it is outside
It warms the rising sun
It kisses everyone
It doesn't remember the hate of yesterday

Oh, can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
Love, love is alive in me

Becomes a cup of doubt

193,The More You Do It (The More I Like It Done To Me),"Now this is for the old school

You keep kissing me and squeezing me, boy
All the time and I like it, baby
And the way you do it
Keeps driving me out of my mind, yes, it does

'Coz you keep on kissing me with your kiss
Touching me with your touch
All the right places and I like it
And the more you do it
The more I like it done to me, I like it, baby

Oh, there's no better feeling
Then when your body's next to mine
Moving and grooving
And when we're not together
I think about you all the time, yes, I do boy

'Coz you keep on kissing me with your kiss
Touching me with your touch
You reach out and feel me with your hands
I like it, I like it so much

And the more you do it
The more I like it done to me
Oh, I like it, baby
I said the more you do it
The more I like it done to me

I like it, baby
I like it, baby

I just want to tell the world
Of how I feel about you, baby

'Coz you keep on kissing me with your kiss
Touching me with your touch
Healing me with your hands
I like it, I like it so much

And the more you do it, the more I like it done

194,Take A Hand,"[Verse 1]
Look
I didn't know what I needed
It doesn't help you're so conceited
Yeah see don't get angry
I'm just telling the truth
I've got some qualities that I should probably work on too
With you and me it's been so back and forth
I don't get it
Is it me?
I really thought you were different
I mean in every situation, how come I was always the dick?
How come the word sorry never once came from you lips?
Okay, You've put on quite a show and I'm glad I didn't miss it
But I wish I could've left before the curtain got lifted

[Chorus]
But you put on a quite a show
Really had me going
Now its time to go
Curtains finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But its over now
But its over now

[Verse 2]
You tweeted ten-thousand times and I still can't get a text huh
You told me you liked it when I called you mine
But somewhere down the line I was defined as still being second best huh
And I’d be lying if I said I’d be fine
I think I missed the memories more than I miss you
If you came running back now I’d probably run back too
This ain’t music this a piece of art
I put your face up on the cover you're a piece of art
Do you think of me and miss me?
Because I think a lot about you
But of lately I’ve been thinking of what I’ll do without you
I don’t know
I don’t know
But I think I wanna stay to see the show

[Verse 3]
But you put on a quite a show
Really had me going
Now it’s time to go
Curtains finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it’s over now
But it’s over now
Things will get better if you just
Things will get better if you just
See this is a new part of this chorus it’s not the end it’s just the encore
Things will be better if you just
See this is a new part of this chorus it’s not the end it’s just the encore
Things will be better if you just
Hold my hand
Baby I promise that you're all I can
Things will be better if you just
Hold my hand
Please
Hold
Hold my
Hold my hand
But it’s over now
Look I
I didn’t know how to put it
So I just put it in a song
And uh
I know I messed up and I’m sorry
And I understand that it’s completely over but um
I hope you hear this and are willing to give me another chance
But it’s over now",Kid Quill,1976,"[93, 52, 41, 42, 46, 52, 63, 73, 83]",9

196,This Masquerade,"[​Intro]​

Are we really happy here with this lonely game we play?
Looking for words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anywhere
We're lost in a masquerade

Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade

[​​Bridge]​​

Both afraid to say we're just to far away
From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappear every time I see your eyes
No matter how hard I try
To understand the reasons why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
Wohoho, in a masquerade

197,Made To Love You,"[Verse 1]
I never thought it could be
And there was nothing that could make me let you go
'Cause you were my wildest dream
But your open hands would become my enemies

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to ask myself if I was right or wrong
But blinded by the making up that I knew all along

[Chorus]
But if I was made to love you
Then how can you bring me pain?
And if I was made to love you
Then how come we're here again?
And why does it hurt so bad?
If I was made to love you, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
It didn't take long to find
That scars can't be covered from all the words you cry
The sorrow you hid behind
And all of your tears won't be able to justify

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to ask myself if I was right or wrong
But blinded by the making up that I knew all along

[Chorus]
That if I was made to love you
Then how can you bring me pain?
And if I was made to love you
Then how come we're here again?
And why does it hurt so bad?
If I was made to love you",Dan Owen,1976,"[99, 79, 80, 88, 92]",5
198,Gimme Your Money Please,"I was walking on down the alley
When a face I've never seen
Came so from deep in the darkness
And his mouth came on real mean

And I saw that he'd been liquored
And he staggered up to -- you know -- he staggered up to his feet
And he said, ""Boy, you'd better move real slow
And gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""

Wasn't that strange
Wasn't that strange indeed

There ain't nothing you won't see
'Cause the streets are filled with bad goings-on
And you know that's no place to be

But my car broke down in the evening
You know it just stopped stone cold
Stopped stone cold in the street
And a dirty mean man with sharp glass eyes
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""
He said, ""Gimme your money please.""

I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico finessing him for Regano

Chop off the top like I’m Eddie Guerrero

This has got to be the saddest day of my life
I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you anymore

And since this is our last day together
I wanna hold you just one more time
When you turn and walk away, don't look back
I wanna remember you just like this

A flaming youth I was bound I would fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone

Can't read notes but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play
Folks used to say
""Sounds a little goofus to me""

Corn fed chords appeal to me
I like rustic harmony
Hold a note and change the key
Hey, well, that's goofus

Not according to the rules
That you learn in music schools
But the folks just dance like fools
They sure go for goofus

Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own

Got together a new kind of orchestra
And we all played just the same goofus harmony
And I must admit
We made a hit
Goofus has been lucky for me

Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool

So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker

One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback

You can't treat me like I'm faggin', ho
You see I'm saggin' (no)
Why I gotta act like a motherfucking asshole (why)
To be king of my motherfucking castle
You'll never be the missus (never)
Breakin' all my dishes
And fuck all my X-bitches

[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours

[Verse 2]
On an' off, off an' on, bitch I'm grown
So stop playing on my phone (stop)
It was a time we used to bump and grind
And find heaven (ahh)
Without a motherfucking reverend
Manage troiges and bomb-ass massages
And dreams of three-car garages
You say I'm cheating when I'm up at the studio
Come to find out you the ho, oh
And you was way out
Talkin' 'bout rap, was gonna play ya
And I was wasting my time writing rhyme (hahaha)
You made yourself loud and clear
You wanted me to choose between you and my career (bitch)
Started fucking with this baller named Chris
Couldn't resist the Rolex on his wrist
I kept on writing my raps with profanity
Now I'm on tour fucking bitches like vanity
You tried to diss this, now you miss this
And the first and fifteenth is like Christmas
Send me naked pictures but give it a rest
With Mrs Ice Cube tatood on your breast
Now you at the back door of my show
Dressed like a ho, aksin' could you blow (no)
Hell no but it's still delicious
Went from rags to riches
And fuck all my X-bitches

[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours

[Verse 3]
Now I hear you sayin' ""Yeah I used to fuck 'im""
Not lettin' 'em know I was a young buck then
Niggas aksin' me ""Man, did you love her?""
Loved her stupid ass enough to fuck her with a rubber (bitch)
Now I hear, I'm your big brother (who?)
Second cousin, friend
Bitch since when?
Incest ain't the way I swing (nah)
Never bought your ass a goddamn thing
That I had to pay for
I was hateful
Ungrateful (uh) and never faithful
Fuckin' everything that I could get my paws on
Walkin' through hell with gasoline draws on
Now I'm on the mic, music is my life
Kids and a wife, heard you was a dyke (damn)
It's your thing if you like the switches
But it's my world and fuck all my X-bitches

[Chorus]
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours
Fuck you, fuck you, especially you
The world ain't yours, the world ain't yours

Never go down the same road twice
Advice from the big homie Ice Cube
Hmm, girl you better get away from here
I don't want that shit no more

My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

[Verse 3]
I got to go now

How come you always load your Pentax

And you can wear you birthday clothes
We can hit the floor

And touch your Panama

When lo (whish, O whish!) mesaw mestreamed, as the green to the gred was flew, was flown, through deafths of durkness greengrown deeper I heard a voice, the voce of Shaun, vote of the Irish, voise from afar (and cert no purer puer palestrine e’er chanted panangelical mid the clouds of Tu es Petrus, not Michaeleen Kelly, not Mara O’Mario, and sure, what more numerose Italicuss ever rawsucked frish uov in urinal?), a brieze to Yverzone o’er the brozaozaozing sea, from Inchigeela call the way how it suspired (morepork! morepork!) to scented nightlife as softly as the loftly marconimasts from Clifden sough open tireless secrets (mauveport! mauveport!) to Nova Scotia’s listing sisterwands. Tubetube!

His handpalm lifted, his handshell cupped, his handsign pointed, his handheart mated, his handaxe risen, his handleaf fallen. Helpsome hand that holemost heals! What is het holy! It gested.

And it said:

— Alo, alass, aladdin, amobus! Does she lag soft fall means rest down? Shaun yawned, as his general address rehearsal, (that was antepropreviousday’s pigeons-ina-pie with rough dough for the carrier and the hash-say-ugh of overgestern pluzz the ‘stuesday’s shampain in his head, with the memories of the past and the hicnuncs of the present embelliching the musics of the futures from Miccheruni’s band) addressing himself ex alto and complaining with vocal discontent it was so close as of the fact the rag was up and of the briefs and billpasses, a houseful of deadheads, of him to dye his paddycoats to morn his hestern- most earning, his board in the swealth of his fate as, having moistened his manducators upon the quiet and scooping molars and grinders clean with his two fore fingers, he sank his hunk, dowanouet to resk at once, exhaust as winded hare, utterly spent, it was all he could do (disgusted with himself that the combined weight of his tons of iosals was a hundred men’s massed too much for him), upon the native heath he loved covered kneehigh with virgin bush, for who who e’er trod sod of Erin could ever sleep off the turf! Well, I’m liberally dished seeing myself in this trim! How all too unwordy am I, a mere mailman of peace, a poor loust hastehater of the first degree, the principot of Candia, no legs and a title, for such eminence, or unpro promenade rather, to be much more exact, as to be the bearer extraordinary of these postoomany missive on his majesty’s service while me and yous and them we’re extending us after the pattern of reposiveness! Weh is me, yeh is ye! I, the mightif beam maircanny, which bit his mirth too early or met his birth too late! It should of been my other with his leickname for he’s the head and I’m an everdevoting fiend of his. I can seeze tomirror in tosdays of yer when we lofobsed os so ker. Those sembal simon pumpkel pieman yers! We shared the twin chamber and we winked on the one wench and what Sim sobs todie I’ll reeve tomorry, for ’twill be, I have hopes of, Sam Dizzier’s feedst. Tune in, tune on, old Tighe, high, high, high, I’m thine owelglass. Be old! He looks rather thin, imitating me. I’m very fond of that other of mine. Fish hands Macsorley! Elien! Obsequies! Bonzeye! Isaac Egari’s Ass! We’re the music-hall pair that won the swimmyease bladdhers at the Guinness gala in Badeniveagh. I ought not to laugh with him on this stage. But he’ such a game loser! I lift my disk to him. Brass and reeds, brace and ready! How is your napper, Handy, and hownow does she stand? First he was living to feel what the eldest daughter she was panseying and last he was dying to know what old Madre Patriack does be up to. Take this John’s Lane in your toastingfourch. Shaun-ti and shaunti and shaunti again! And twelve coolinder moons! I am no helotwashipper but I revere her! For my own coant! She has studied! Piscisvendolor! You’re grace! Futs dronk of Wouldndom! But, Gemini, he’s looking frightfully thin! I heard the man Shee shinging in the pantry bay. Down among the dust-bins let him lie! Ear! Ear! Not ay! Eye! Eye! For I’m at the heart of it. Yet I cannot on my solemn merits as a recitativer recollect ever having done of anything of the kind to deserve of such. Not the phost of a nation! Nor by a long trollop! I just didn’t have the time to. Saint Anthony Guide!
— But have we until now ever besought you, dear Shaun, we remembered, who it was, good boy, to begin with, who out of symphony gave you the permit?
— Goodbye now, Shaun replied, with a voice pure as a church-mode, in echo rightdainty, with a good catlick tug at his coco — moss candylock, a foretaste in time of his cabbageous brain’s curlyflower. Athiacaro! Comb his tar odd gee sing your mower O meeow? Greet thee Good? How are them columbuses! Lard have mustard on them! Fatiguing, very fatiguing. Hobos hom-knees and the corveeture of my spine. Poumeerme! My heaviest crux and dairy lot it is, with a bed as hard as the thinkamuddles of the Greeks and a board as bare as a Roman altar. I’m off rabbited kitchens and relief porridgers. No later than a very few fortnichts since I was meeting on the Thinker’s Dam with a pair of men out of glasshouse whom I shuffled hands with named MacBlacks — I think their names is MacBlakes — from the Headfire Clump — and they were improving me and making me beliek no five hour factory life with insufficient emollient and industrial disabled for them that day o’gratises. I have the highest grati-fication by anuncing how I have it from whowho but Hagios Colleenkiller’s prophecies. After suns and moons, dews and wettings, thunders and fires, comes sabotag. Solvitur palum-ballando! Tilvido! Adie!
— Then, we explained, salve a tour, ambly andy, you possibly might be so by order?
— Forgive me, Shaun repeated from his liquid lipes, not what I wants to do a strike of work but it was condemned on me pre-mitially by Hireark Books and Chiefoverseer Cooks in their Eusebian Concordant Homilies and there does be a power com- ing over me that is put upon me from on high out of the book of breedings and so as it is becoming hairydittary I have of coerce nothing in view to look forward at unless it is Swann and beating the blindquarters out of my oldfellow’s orologium oloss olo — rium. A bad attack of maggot it feels like. ’Tis trope, custodian said. Almost might I say of myself, while keeping out of crime, I am now becoming about fed up be going circulating about them new hikler’s highways like them nameless souls, ercked and skorned and grizzild all over, till it’s rusty October in this bleak forest and was veribally complussed by thinking of the crater of some noted volcano or the Dublin river or the catchalot trouth subsi-as away out or to isolate i from my multiple Mes on the spits of Lumbage Island or bury meself, clogs, coolcellar and all, deep in my wineupon ponteen unless Morrissey’s colt could help me or the gander maybe at 49 as it is a tithe fish so it is, this pig’s stomach business, and where on dearth or in the miraculous meddle of this expending umniverse to turn since it came into my hands I am hopeless off course to be doing anything concerning.
— We expect you are, honest Shaun, we agreed, but from franking machines, limricked, that in the end it may well turn out, we hear to be you, our belated, who will bear these open letter. Speak to us of Emailia.
— As, Shaun replied patly, with tootlepick tact too and a down of his dampers, to that I have the gumpower and, by the benison of Barbe, that is a lock to say with everything, my be-loved.
— Would you mind telling us, Shaun honey, beg little big moreboy, we proposed to such a dear youth, where mostly are you able to work. Ah, you might! Whimper and we shall.
— Here! Shaun replied, while he was fondling one of his cowheel cuffs. There’s no sabbath for nomads and I mostly was able to walk, being too soft for work proper, sixty odd eilish mires a week between three masses a morn and two chaplets at eve. I am always telling those pedestriasts, my answerers, Top, Sid and Hucky, now (and it is a veriest throth as the thieves’ re- scension) how it was forstold for me by brevet for my vacation in life while possessing stout legs to be disbarred after holy orders from unnecessary servile work of reckless walking of all sorts for the relics of my time for otherwise by my so douching I would get into a blame there where sieves fall out, Excelsior tips the best. Weak stop work stop walk stop whoak. Go thou this island, one housesleep there, then go thou other island, two housesleep there, then catch one nightmaze, then home to dearies. Never back a woman you defend, never get quit of a friend on whom you depend never make face to a foe till he’s rife and never get stuck to another man’s pfife. Amen; ptah! His hungry will be done! On the continent as in Eironesia. But believe me in my simplicity I am awful good, I believe, so I am, at the root of me, praised be right cheek Discipline! And I can now truthfully declaret before my Geity’s Pantokreator with my fleshfettered palms on the epizzles of the apossels that I do my reasonabler’s best to recite my grocery beans for mummy mit dummy mot muthar mat bonzar regular, genuflections enclosed. Hek domov muy, there thou beest on the hummock, ghee up, ye dog, for your daggily broth, etc., Happy Maria and Glorious Patrick, etc., etc. In fact, always, have I believe. Greedo! Her’s me hongue!
— And it is the fullsoot of a tarabred. Yet one minute’s ob-servation, dear dogmestic Shaun, as we point out how you have while away painted our town a wearing greenridinghued.
— O murder mere, how did you hear? Shaun replied, smoiling the ily way up his lampsleeve (it just seemed the natural thing to do), so shy of light was he then. Well, so be it! The gloom hath rays, her lump is love. And I will confess to have, yes. Your diogneses is anonest man’s. Thrubedore I did! Inditty I did. All lay I did. Down with the Saozon ruze! And I am afraid it wouldn’t be my first coat’s wasting after striding on the vampire and blazing on the focoal. See! blazing on the focoal. As see! blazing upon the foe. Like the regular redshank I am. Impregnable as the mule himself. Somebody may perhaps hint at an aughter impression of was wrong. No such a thing! You never made a more freud-ful mistake, excuse yourself! What’s pork to you means meat to me while you behold how I be eld. But it is grandiose by my ways of thinking from the prophecies. New worlds for all! And they were scotographically arranged for gentlemen only by a scripchewer in whofoundland who finds he is a relative. And it was with my extravert davy. Like glue. Be through. Moyhard’s daynoight, tomthumb. Phwum!
— How mielodorous is thy bel chant, O songbird, and how exqueezit thine after draught! Buccinate in Emenia tuba insigni volumnitatis tuae. But do you mean, O phausdheen phewn, from Pontoffbellek till the Kisslemerched our ledan triz will be? we gathered substantively whether furniture would or verdure var-nish?
— It is a confoundyous injective so to say, Shaun the fiery boy shouted, naturally incensed, as he shook the red pepper out of his auricles. And another time please confine your glaring intinuations to some other mordant body. What on the physiog of this furnaced planet would I be doing besides your verjuice? That is more than I can fix, for the teom bihan, anyway. So let I and you now kindly drop that, angryman! That’s not French pastry. You can take it from me. Understand me when I tell you (and I will ask you not to whisple, cry golden or quoth mecback) that under the past purcell’s office, so deeply deplored by my erstwhile elder friend, Miss Enders, poachmistress and gay re-ceiver ever for in particular to the Scotic Poor Men’s Thousand Gallon Cow Society (I was thinking of her in sthore) allbethey blessed with twentytwo thousand sorters out of a biggest poss of twentytwo thousand, mine’s won, too much privet stationery and safty quipu was ate up larchly by those nettlesome goats out of pension greed. Colpa di Becco, buon apartita! Proceding, I will say it is also one of my avowal’s intentions, at some time pease Pod pluse murthers of gout (when I am not prepared to say) so apt as my pen is upt to scratch, to compound quite the makings of a verdigrease savingsbook in the form of a pair of capri sheep boxing gloves surrounding this matter of the Welsfusel mascoteers and their sindybuck that saved a city for my publickers, Nolaner and Browno, Nickil Hopstout, Christcross, so long as, thanks to force of destiny, my selary as a paykelt is propaired, and there is a peg under me and there is a tum till me.
To the Very Honourable The Memory of Disgrace, the Most Noble, Sometime Sweepyard at the Service of the Writer. Salu-tem dicint. The just defunct Mrs Sanders who (the Loyd insure her!) I was shift and shuft too, with her shester Mrs Shunders, both mudical dauctors from highschoolhorse and aslyke as Easther’s leggs. She was the niceliest person of a wellteached non-party woman that I ever acquired her letters, only too fat, used to babies and tottydean verbish this is her entertermentdags for she shuk the bottle and tuk the medascene all times a day. She was well under ninety, poor late Mrs, and had tastes of the poetics, me having stood the pilgarlick a fresh at sea when the moon also was standing in a corner of sweet Standerson my ski. P.L.M Mevrouw von Andersen was her whogave me a muttonbrooch, stakkers for her begfirst party. Honour thy farmer and my lit-ters. This, my tears, is my last will intesticle wrote off in the strutforit about their absent female assauciations which I, or per-haps any other person what squaton a toffette, have the honour to had upon their polite sophykussens in the real presence of de-vouted Mrs Grumby when her skin was exposed to the air. O what must the grief of my mund be for two little ptpt coolies worth twenty thousand quad herewitdnessed with both’s maddlemass wishes to Pepette for next match from their dearly beloved Roggers, M.D.D. O.D. May doubling drop of drooght! Writing.
— Hopsoloosely kidding you are totether with your cadenus and goat along nose how we shall complete that white paper. Two venusstas! Biggerstiff! Qweer but gaon! Be trouz and wholetrouz! Otherwise, frank Shaun, we pursued, what would be the autobiography of your softbodied fumiform?
— Hooraymost! None whomsoever, Shaun replied, Heavenly blank! (he had intentended and was peering now rather close to the paste of his rubiny winklering) though it ought to be more or less rawcawcaw romantical. By the wag, how is Mr Fry? All of it, I might say, in ex-voto, pay and perks and wooden half- pence, some rhino, rhine, O joyoust rhine, was handled over spon-daneously by me (and bundle end to my illwishers’ Miss Anders! she woor her wraith of ruins the night she lost I left!) in the ligname of Mr van Howten of Tredcastles, Clowntalkin, timbreman, among my prodigits nabobs and navious of every subscription entitled the Bois in the Boscoor, our evicted tenemants. What I say is (and I am noen roehorn or culkilt permit me to tell you, if uninformed), I never spont it. Nor have I the ghuest of innation on me the way to. It is my rule so. It went anyway like hot pottagebake. And this brings me to my fresh point. Quoniam, I am as plain as portable enveloped, inhowmuch, you will now parably receive, care of one of Mooseyeare Goonness’s registered andouterthus barrels. Quick take um whiffat andrainit. Now!
— So vi et! we responded. Song! Shaun, song! Have mood! Hold forth!
— I apologuise, Shaun began, but I would rather spinooze you one from the grimm gests of Jacko and Esaup, fable one, feeble too. Let us here consider the casus, my dear little cousis (husstenhasstencaffincoffintussemtossemdamandamnacosaghcusa-ghhobixhatouxpeswchbechoscashlcarcarcaract) of the Ondt and the Gracehoper.
The Gracehoper was always jigging ajog, hoppy on akkant of his joyicity, (he had a partner pair of findlestilts to supplant him), or, if not, he was always making ungraceful overtures to Floh and Luse and Bienie and Vespatilla to play pupa-pupa and pulicy-pulicy and langtennas and pushpygyddyum and to com-mence insects with him, there mouthparts to his orefice and his gambills to there airy processes, even if only in chaste, ameng the everlistings, behold a waspering pot. He would of curse melissciously, by his fore feelhers, flexors, contractors, depres-sors and extensors, lamely, harry me, marry me, bury me, bind me, till she was puce for shame and allso fourmish her in Spin-ner’s housery at the earthsbest schoppinhour so summery as his cottage, which was cald fourmillierly Tingsomingenting, groped up. Or, if he was always striking up funny funereels with Bester-farther Zeuts, the Aged One, With all his wigeared corollas, albe — dinous and oldbuoyant, inscythe his elytrical wormcasket and Dehlia and Peonia, his druping nymphs, bewheedling him, com-pound eyes on hornitosehead, and Auld Letty Plussiboots to scratch his cacumen and cackle his tramsitus, diva deborah (seven bolls of sapo, a lick of lime, two spurts of fussfor, threefurts of sulph, a shake o’shouker, doze grains of migniss and a mesfull of midcap pitchies. The whool of the whaal in the wheel of the whorl of the Boubou from Bourneum has thus come to taon!), and with tambarins and cantoridettes soturning around his eggs-hill rockcoach their dance McCaper in retrophoebia, beck from bulk, like fantastic disossed and jenny aprils, to the ra, the ra, the ra, the ra, langsome heels and langsome toesis, attended to by a mutter and doffer duffmatt baxingmotch and a myrmidins of pszozlers pszinging Satyr’s Caudledayed Nice and Hombly, Dombly Sod We Awhile but Ho, Time Timeagen, Wake! For if sciencium (what’s what) can mute uns nought, ‘a thought, abought the Great Sommboddy within the Omniboss, perhops an artsaccord (hoot’s hoot) might sing ums tumtim abutt the Little Newbuddies that ring his panch. A high old tide for the bar-heated publics and the whole day as gratiis! Fudder and lighting for ally looty, any filly in a fog, for O’Cronione lags acrumbling in his sands but his sunsunsuns still tumble on. Erething above ground, as his Book of Breathings bed him, so as everwhy, sham or shunner, zeemliangly to kick time.

Grouscious me and scarab my sahull What a bagateller it is! Libelulous! Inzanzarity! Pou! Pschla! Ptuh! What a zeit for the goths! vented the Ondt, who, not being a sommerfool, was thothfolly making chilly spaces at hisphex affront of the icinglass of his windhame, which was cold antitopically Nixnixundnix. We shall not come to party at that lopp’s, he decided possibly, for he is not on our social list. Nor to Ba’s berial nether, thon sloghard, this oldeborre’s yaar ablong as there’s a khul on a khat. Nefersenless, when he had safely looked up his ovipository, he loftet hails and prayed: May he me no voida water! Seekit Ha-tup! May no he me tile pig shed on! Suckit Hotup! As broad as Beppy’s realm shall flourish my reign shall flourish! As high as Heppy’s hevn shall flurrish my haine shall hurrish! Shall grow, shall flourish! Shall hurrish! Hummum.

The Ondt was a weltall fellow, raumybult and abelboobied, bynear saw altitudinous wee a schelling in kopfers. He was sair sair sullemn and chairmanlooking when he was not making spaces in his psyche, but, laus! when he wore making spaces on his ikey, he ware mouche mothst secred and muravyingly wisechairman-looking. Now whim the sillybilly of a Gracehoper had jingled through a jungle of love and debts and jangled through a jumble of life in doubts afterworse, wetting with the bimblebeaks, drik-king with nautonects, bilking with durrydunglecks and horing after ladybirdies (ichnehmon diagelegenaitoikon) he fell joust as sieck as a sexton and tantoo pooveroo quant a churchprince, and wheer the midges to wend hemsylph or vosch to sirch for grub for his corapusse or to find a hospes, alick, he wist gnit! Bruko dry! fuko spint! Sultamont osa bare! And volomundo osi vide-vide! Nichtsnichtsundnichts! Not one pickopeck of muscow — money to bag a tittlebits of beebread! Iomio! Iomio! Crick’s corbicule, which a plight! O moy Bog, he contrited with melan-ctholy. Meblizzered, him sluggered! I am heartily hungry!
He had eaten all the whilepaper, swallowed the lustres, de-voured forty flights of styearcases, chewed up all the mensas and seccles, ronged the records, made mundballs of the ephemerids and vorasioused most glutinously with the very timeplace in the ternitary — not too dusty a cicada of neutriment for a chittinous chip so mitey. But when Chrysalmas was on the bare branches, off he went from Tingsomingenting. He took a round stroll and he took a stroll round and he took a round strollagain till the grillies in his head and the leivnits in his hair made him thought he had the Tossmania. Had he twicycled the sees of the deed and trestraversed their revermer? Was he come to hevre with his engiles or gone to hull with the poop? The June snows was flocking in thuckflues on the hegelstomes, millipeeds of it and myriopoods, and a lugly whizzling tournedos, the Boraborayel-]ers, blohablasting tegolhuts up to tetties and ruching sleets off the coppeehouses, playing ragnowrock rignewreck, with an irri- tant, penetrant, siphonopterous spuk. Grausssssss! Opr! Grausssssss! Opr!

The Gracehoper who, though blind as batflea, yet knew, not a leetle beetle, his good smetterling of entymology asped niss-unitimost lous nor liceens but promptly tossed himself in the vico, phthin and phthir, on top of his buzzer, tezzily wondering wheer would his aluck alight or boss of both appease and the next time he makes the aquinatance of the Ondt after this they have met themselves, these mouschical umsummables, it shall be motylucky if he will beheld not a world of differents. Behailed His Gross the Ondt, prostrandvorous upon his dhrone, in his Papylonian babooshkees, smolking a spatial brunt of Hosana cigals, with unshrinkables farfalling from his unthinkables, swarming of himself in his sunnyroom, sated before his com-fortumble phullupsuppy of a plate o’monkynous and a confucion of minthe (for he was a conformed aceticist and aristotaller), as appi as a oneysucker or a baskerboy on the Libido, with Floh biting his leg thigh and Luse lugging his luff leg and Bieni bussing him under his bonnet and Vespatilla blowing cosy fond tutties up the allabroad length of the large of his smalls. As entomate as intimate could pinchably be. Emmet and demmet and be jiltses crazed and be jadeses whipt! schneezed the Gracehoper, aguepe with ptchjelasys and at his wittol’s indts, what have eyeforsight!

The Ondt, that true and perfect host, a spiter aspinne, was making the greatest spass a body could with his queens lace-swinging for he was spizzing all over him like thingsumanything in formicolation, boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of houris. He was ameising himself hugely at crabround and mary-pose, chasing Floh out of charity and tickling Luse, I hope too, and tackling Bienie, faith, as well, and jucking Vespatilla jukely by the chimiche. Never did Dorsan from Dunshanagan dance it with more devilry! The veripatetic imago of the impossible Gracehoper on his odderkop in the myre, after his thrice ephe-meral journeeys, sans mantis ne shooshooe, featherweighed animule, actually and presumptuably sinctifying chronic’s de-spair, was sufficiently and probably coocoo much for his chorous of gravitates. Let him be Artalone the Weeps with his parisites peeling off him I’ll be Highfee the Crackasider. Flunkey Footle furloughed foul, writing off his phoney, but Conte Carme makes the melody that mints the money. Ad majorem l.s.d.! Divi gloriam. A darkener of the threshold. Haru? Orimis, capsizer of his ant-boat, sekketh rede from Evil-it-is, lord of loaves in Amongded. Be it! So be it! Thou-who-thou-art, the fleet-as-spindhrift, impfang thee of mine wideheight. Haru!

The thing pleased him andt, and andt, He larved ond he larved on he merd such a nauses The Gracehoper feared he would mixplace his fauces. I forgive you, grondt Ondt, said the Gracehoper, weeping, For their sukes of the sakes you are safe in whose keeping. Teach Floh and Luse polkas, show Bienie where’s sweet And be sure Vespatilla fines fat ones to heat. As I once played the piper I must now pay the count So saida to Moyhammlet and marhaba to your Mount! Let who likes lump above so what flies be a full ’un; I could not feel moregruggy if this was prompollen. I pick up your reproof, the horsegift of a friend, For the prize of your save is the price of my spend. Can castwhores pulladeftkiss if oldpollocks forsake ’em Or Culex feel etchy if Pulex don’t wake him? A locus to loue, a term it t’embarass, These twain are the twins that tick Homo Vulgaris. Has Aquileone nort winged to go syf Since the Gwyfyn we were in his farrest drewbryf And that Accident Man not beseeked where his story ends Since longsephyring sighs sought heartseast for their orience? We are Wastenot with Want, precondamned, two and true, Till Nolans go volants and Bruneyes come blue. Ere those gidflirts now gadding you quit your mocks for my gropes An extense must impull, an elapse must elopes, Of my tectucs takestock, tinktact, and ail’s weal; As I view by your farlook hale yourself to my heal. Partiprise my thinwhins whiles my blink points unbroken on Your whole’s whercabroads with Tout’s trightyright token on. My in risible universe youdly haud find Sulch oxtrabeeforeness meat soveal behind. Your feats end enormous, your volumes immense, (May the Graces I hoped for sing your Ondtship song sense!), Your genus its worldwide, your spacest sublime! But, Holy Saltmartin, why can’t you beat time?

In the name of the former and of the latter and of their holo-caust. Allmen.

— Now? How good you are in explosition! How farflung is your fokloire and how velktingeling your volupkabulary! Qui vive sparanto qua muore contanto. O foibler, O flip, you’ve that wandervogl wail withyin! It falls easily upon the earopen and goes down the friskly shortiest like treacling tumtim with its tingting-taggle. The blarneyest blather in all Corneywall! But could you, of course, decent Lettrechaun, we knew (to change your name of not your nation) while still in the barrel, read the strangewrote anaglyptics of those shemletters patent for His Christian’s Em?
— Greek! Hand it to me! Shaun replied, plosively pointing to the cinnamon quistoquill behind his acoustrolobe. I’m as after-dusk nobly Roman as pope and water could christen me. Look at that for a ridingpin! I am, thing Sing Larynx, letter potent to play the sem backwards like Oscan wild or in shunt Persse trans-luding from the Otherman or off the Toptic or anything off the types of my finklers in the draught or with buttles, with my oyes thickshut and all. But, hellas, it is harrobrew bad on the corns and callouses. As far as that goes I associate myself with your remark just now from theodicy re’furloined notepaper and quite agree in your prescriptions for indeed I am, pay Gay, in juxtaposition to say it is not a nice production. It is a pinch of scribble, not wortha bottle of cabbis. Overdrawn! Puffedly offal tosh! Be-sides its auctionable, all about crime and libel! Nothing beyond clerical horrors et omnibus‘ to be entered for the foreign as second-class matter. The fuellest filth ever fired since Charley Lucan’s. Flummery is what I would call it if you were to ask me to put it on a single dimension what pronounced opinion I might possibly orally have about them bagses of trash which the mother and Mr Unmentionable (O breed not his same!) has reduced to writing without making news out of my sootynemm. When she slipped under her couchman. And where he made a cat with a peep. How they wore two madges on the makewater. And why there were treefellers in the shrubrubs. Then he hawks his hand-mud figgers from Francie to Fritzie down in the kookin. Phiz is me mother and Hair’s me father. Bauv Betty Famm and Pig Pig Pike. Their livetree (may it flourish!) by their ecotaph (let it stayne!). With balsinbal bimbies swarming tiltop. Comme bien, Comme bien! Feefeel! Feefeel! And the Dutches dyin loffin at his pon peck de Barec. And all the mound reared. Till he wot not wot to begin he should. An infant sailing eggshells on the floor of a wet day would have more sabby.

— Kind Shaun, we all requested, much as we hate to say it, but since you rose to the use of money have you not, without suggesting for an instant, millions of moods used up slanguage tun times as words as the penmarks used out in sinscript with such hesitancy by your cerebrated brother — excuse me not men-tioningahem?
— CelebrAted! Shaun replied under the sheltar of his brog-uish, vigorously rubbing his magic lantern to a glow of full — consciousness. HeCitEncy! Your words grates on my ares. Notorious I rather would feel inclined to myself in the first place to describe Mr O’Shem the Draper with before letter as should I be accentually called upon for a dieoguinnsis to pass my opinions, properly spewing, into impulsory irelitz. But I would not care to be so unfruitful to my own part as to swear for the moment posi-tively as to the views of Denmark. No, sah! But let me say my every belief before my high Gee is that I much doubt of it. I’ve no room for that fellow on my fagroaster, I just can’t. As I hourly learn from Rooters and Havers through Gilligan’s maypoles in a nice pathetic notice he, the pixillated doodler, is on his last with illegible clergimanths boasting always of his ruddy complexious! She, the mammy far, was put up to it by him, the iniquity that ought to be depraved of his libertins to be silenced, sackclothed and suspended, and placed in irons into some drapyery institution off the antipopees for wordsharping only if he was klanver enough to pass the panel fleischcurers and the fieldpost censor. Gach! For that is a fullblown fact and well celibated before the four divorce courts and all the King’s paunches, how he has the solitary from seeing Scotch snakes and has a lowsense for the pro-duction of consumption and dalickey cyphalos on his brach premises where he can purge his contempt and dejeunerate into a skillyton be thinking himself to death. Rot him! Flannelfeet! Flatty-ro! I will describe you in a word. Thou. (I beg your pardon.) Homo! Then putting his bedfellow on me! (like into mike and nick onto post). The criniman: I’ll give it to him for that! Making the lobbard change hisstops, as we say in the long book! Is he on whosekeeping or are my! Obnoximost posthumust! With his unique hornbook and his prince of the apauper’s pride, blundering all over the two worlds! If he waits till I buy him a mossel — man’s present! Ho’s nos halfcousin of mine, pigdish! Nor wants to! I’d famish with the cuistha first. Aham!
— May we petition you, Shaun illustrious, then, to put his prentis’ pride in your aproper’s purse and to unravel in your own sweet way with words of style to your very and most obse-quient, we suggested, with yet an esiop’s foible, as to how?
— Well it is partly my own, isn’t it? and you may, ought and welcome, Shaun replied, taking at the same time, as his hunger got the bitter of him, a hearty bite out of the honeycomb of his Braham and Melosedible hat, tryone, tryon and triune. Ann wun-kum. Sure, I thunkum you knew all about that, honorey causes, through thelemontary channels long agum. Sure, that is as old as the Baden bees of Saint Dominoc’s and as commonpleas now to allus pueblows and bunkum as Nelson his trifulgurayous pillar. However. Let me see, do. Beerman’s bluff was what begun it, Old Knoll and his borrowing! And then the liliens of the veldt, Nancy Nickies and Folletta Lajambe! Then mem and hem and the jaque-jack. All about Wucherer and righting his name for him. I regret to announce, after laying out his litterery bed, for two days she kept squealing down for noisy priors and bawling out to her jameymock farceson in Shemish like a mouther of the incas with a garcielasso huw Ananymus pinched her tights and about the Balt with the markshaire parawag and his loyal divorces, when he feraxiously shed ovas in Alemaney, tse tse, all the tell of the tud with the bourighevisien backclack, and him, the cribibber like an ambitrickster, aspiring like the decan’s, fast aslooped in the intrance to his polthronechair with his sixth finger between his cats — eye and the index, making his pillgrimace of Childe Horrid, en — grossing to his ganderpan what the idioglossary he invented under hicks hyssop! Hock! Ickick gav him that toock, imitator! And it was entirely theck latter to blame. Does he drink because I am sorely there shall be no more Kates and Nells. If you see him it took place there. It was given meeck, thank the Bench, to assist at the whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as I think of that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cutting my prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the jawache! Be me punting his reflection he’d begin his beogre-fright in muddyass ribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef! You know he’s peculiar, that eggschicker, with the smell of old woman off him, to suck nothing of his switchedupes. M.D. made his ante mortem for him. He was grey at three, like sygnus the swan, when he made his boo to the public and barnacled up to the eyes when he repented after seven. The alum that winters on his top is the stale of the staun that will soar when he stambles till that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He was down with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason the whopping first time he prediseased me. He’s weird, I tell you, and middayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls feet and his tanbark complexion. That’s why he was forbidden tomate and was warmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under the Helpless Corpses Enactment. I’m not at all surprised the saint kicked him whereby the sum taken Berkeley showed the reason genrously. Negas, negasti — negertop, negertoe, negertoby, ne-grunter! Then he was pusched out of Thingamuddy’s school by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught the europicolas and went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czeschs and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos. One temp when he foiled to be killed, the freak wanted to put his bilingual head intentionally through the Ikish Tames and go and join the clericy as a demoni-can skyterrier. Throwing dust in the eyes of the Hooley Fer — mers! He used to be avowdeed as he ought to be vitandist. For onced I squeaked by twyst I’ll squelch him. Then he went to Cecilia’s treat on his solo to pick up Galen. Asbestopoulos! Inku-pot! He has encaust in the blood. Shim! I have the outmost con tempt for. Prost bitten! Conshy! Tiberia is waiting on you, arestocrank! Chaka a seagull ticket at Gattabuia and Gabbiano’s! Go o’er the sea, haythen, from me and leave your libber to TCD. Your puddin is cooked! You’re served, cram ye! Fatefully yaourth . . . Ex. Ex. Ex. Ex.
— But for what, thrice truthful teller, Shaun of grace? weakly we went on to ask now of the gracious one. Vouchsafe to say. You will now, goodness, won’t you? Why?
— For his root language, if you ask me whys, Shaun replied, as he blessed himself devotionally like a crawsbomb, making act of oblivion, footinmouther! (what the thickuns else?) which he picksticked into his lettruce invrention. Ullhodturdenweirmud-gaardgringnirurdrmolnirfenrirlukkilokkibaugimandodrrerin — surtkrinmgernrackinarockar! Thor’s for yo!
— The hundredlettered name again, last word of perfect lan-guage. But you could come near it, we do suppose, strong Shaun 0’, we foresupposed. How?
— Peax! Peax! Shaun replied in vealar penultimatum. ’Tis pebils before Sweeney’s as he swigged a slug of Jon Jacobsen from his treestem sucker cane. Mildbut likesome! I might as well be talking to the four waves till tibbes grey eves and the rests asleep. Frost! Nope! No one in his seven senses could as I have before said, only you missed my drift, for it’s being incendiary. Every dimmed letter in it is a copy and not a few of the silbils and wholly words I can show you in my Kingdom of Heaven. The lowquacity of him! With his threestar monothong! Thaw! The last word in stolentelling! And what’s more right-down lowbrown schisthematic robblemint! Yes. As he was rising my lather. Like you. And as I was plucking his goosybone. Like yea. He store the tale of me shur. Like yup. How’s that for Shemese?
— Still in a way, not to flatter you, we fancy you that you are so strikingly brainy and well letterread in yourshelves as ever were the Shamous Shamonous, Limited, could use worse of yourself, ingenious Shaun, we still so fancied, if only you would take your time so and the trouble of so doing it. Upu now!
— Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the mutter-melk of his blood donor beginning to work, and while innocent of disseminating the foul emanation, it would be a fall day I could not, sole, so you can keep your space and by the power of blurry wards I am loyable to do it (I am convicted of it!) any time ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me boot allowance!) with the allergrossest transfusiasm as, you see, while I can soroquise the Siamanish better than most, it is an openear secret, be it said, how I am extremely ingenuous at the clerking even with my badily left and, arrah go braz, I’d pinsel it with immenuensoes as easy as I’d perorate a chickerow of beans for the price of two maricles and my trifolium librotto, the authordux Book of Lief, would, if given to daylight, (I hold a most incredible faith about it) far exceed what that bogus bolshy of a shame, my soamheis brother, Gaoy Fecks, is conversant with in audible black and prink. Outragedy of poetscalds! Acomedy of letters! I have them all, tame, deep and harried, in my mine’s I. And one of these fine days, man dear, when the mood is on me, that I may willhap cut my throat with my tongue tonight but I will be ormuzd moved to take potlood and introvent it Paatryk just like a work of merit, mark my words and append to my mark twang, that will open your pucktricker’s ops for you, broather brooher, only for, as a papst and an immature and a nayophight and a spaciaman spaciosum and a hundred and eleven other things, I would never for anything take so much trouble of such doing. And why so? Because I am altogether a chap too fly and hairyman for to infradig the like of that ultravirulence. And by all I hold sacred on earth clouds and in heaven I swear to you on my piop and oath by the awe of Shaun (and that’s a howl of a name!) that I will commission to the flames any incendiarist whosoever or ahriman howsoclever who would endeavour to set ever annyma roner moother of mine on fire. Rock me julie but I will soho!
And, with that crickcrackcruck of his threelungged squool from which grief had usupped every smile, big hottempered husky fusky krenfy strenfy pugiliser, such as he was, he virtually broke down on the mooherhead, getting quite jerry over her, overpowered by himself with the love of the tearsilver that he twined through her hair for, sure, he was the soft semplgawn slob of the world with a heart like Montgomery’s in his showchest and harvey loads of feeling in him and as innocent and undesign-ful as the freshfallen calef. Still, grossly unselfish in sickself, he dished allarmes away and laughed it off with a wipe at his pud-gies and a gulp apologetic, healing his tare be the smeyle of his oye, oogling around.

Moe like that only he stopped short in looking up up upfrom his tide shackled wrists through the ghost of an ocean’s, the wieds of pansiful heathvens of joepeter’s gaseytotum as they are telling not but were and will be, all told, scruting fore-back into the fargoneahead to feel out what age in years tropical, ecclesiastic, civil or sidereal he might find by the sirious pointstand of Charley’s Wain (what betune the spheres sledding along the lacteal and the mansions of the blest turning on old times) as ere-while had he craved of thus, the dreamskhwindel necklassoed him, his thumbs fell into his fists and, lusosing the harmonical balance of his ballbearing extremities, by the holy kettle, like a flask of lightning over he careened (O the sons of the fathers!) by the mightyfine weight of his barrel (all that prevented the happering of who if not the asterisks betwink themselves shall ever?) and, as the wisest postlude course he could playact, collaspsed in en-semble and rolled buoyantly backwards in less than a twink — ling via Rattigan’s corner out of farther earshot with his highly curious mode of slipashod motion, surefoot, sorefoot, slickfoot, slackfoot, linkman laizurely, lampman loungey, and by Killesther’s lapes and falls, with corks, staves and treeleaves and more bub-bles to his keelrow a fairish and easy way enough as the town cow cries behind the times in the direction of Mac Auliffe’s, the crucet-house, Open the Door Softly, down in the valley before he was really uprighted ere in a dip of the downs (uila!) he spoorlessly disappaled and vanesshed, like a popo down a papa, from circular circulatio. Ah, mean!

220,Rock And Roll Music,"[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock-and-roll music
Any old time you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless you try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounded like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock-and-roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks
To hear a friend of mine a-wail a sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock-and-roll music
Any old time you choose it
Got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 3]
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
Keep on rockin' that piano

[Chorus]
Why I go for that rock-and-roll music
Any old time you choose it
Got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Gotta be rock-roll music
If you wanna dance with me

[Chorus]
Rock-and-roll music

I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there

Could see another kind of mind there

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?

[Verse 2]
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you

[Chorus 1]
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day

[Chorus 2]
Got to get you into my life

When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there

Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life

Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care, I wasn't scared
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair, should I be scared?

[Chorus]
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

[Verse 2]
I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
But now you're back
It’s so terrifying how you paralyze me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you're showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I’m so unprepared
I’m fucking scared

You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Put the eats on the table
Hate's in the city
And my love's in the meadow
Hands on the plow
And my feets in the ghetto

[Verse 4]
Stand up, sit down
Don't do nothing
It isn't no good when boss man's

For paper notes
And their babies cry
While cities lie at their feet

Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been ""when it's right, it's right""
Why wait until the middle of a cold, dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here any way

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting

[Chorus]
Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

[Verse 2]
Started out this morning feeling so polite
I always thought a fish could not be caught who didn't bite
But you've got some bait a waitin' and I think I might
Like having a little afternoon delight

Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight
Afternoon delight

Please be waiting for me baby when I come around
We could make a lot of lovin' 'fore the sun goin' down

229,Young Hearts Run Free,"What's the sense in sharing this one and only life
Ending up just another lost and lonely wife
You count up the years
And they will be filled with tears

Love only breaks up to start over again
You'll get the babies
But you won't have your man
While he is busy loving every woman that he can, uh-huh

Say I'm gonna leave
A hundred times a day
It's easier said than done
When you just can't break away
(Just can't break away)

Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
My man and me

Ooh, young hearts
To yourself be true
Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

It's high time now, just one crack at life
Who wants to live in trouble and strife
My mind must be free to learn all I can about me, mmm

I'm gonna love me for the rest of my days
Encourage the babies every time they say
Self preservation is what's really going on today

Say I'm gonna turn loose
A thousand times a day
How can I turn loose
When I just can't break away
(When I just can't break away)

Oh, young hearts run free
They'll never be hung up
Hung up like my man and me
You and me

Ooh, young hearts

Don't be no fool when love really don't love you
Don't love you

230,I'm Easy,"{Intro}

It's not my way to love you
Just when no one's looking
It's not my way to take
Your hand if I'm not sure

It's not my way to let you see
What's going on inside of me
When it's a love you
Won't be needing, you're not free

Please stop pulling at my sleeve
If you're just playing
If you won't take the things
You make me want to give

I never cared too much for games
And this one's driving me insane
You're not half as free
To wander as you claim

But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy

Don't lead me on
If there's nowhere
For you to take me
If loving you will have
To be a sometime thing

I can't put bars on my insides
My love is something I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall
The times I've tried

I'm easy, yeah I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Don't do me favors
Let me watch you from a distance
Cause when you're near
I find it hard to keep my head

When your eyes throw light at mine
It's enough to change my mind
Make me leave my
Cautious words and ways behind

That's why I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Say you want me, I'll come running
Without taking time to think
Because I'm easy

Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game

[Verse 1]
The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your o.k

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Verse 2]
We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
Cause southern belles are hell at night

You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
Class of seven four gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Bridge]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
Cause me and moon are itching to play

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothin' like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

It's in view

Granite charades are played in the rain
Till we fall through a sand castle window
To avoid the pain
Summer canoe paddles up to you
'Cause it's time for another beer run
Or something that's equally true

Lives to shatter, hearts to bleed, as dreamers walk blindly. Unto man, woman is born but woman cannot conceive. And after the dance the heat begins to fall the blind man can see, as another takes the call and after the dance all gone but the flesh nowhere left to hide, in the nonsense they have left. As the sky opened up and the rain fell towards this planet we call earth, the prophet cannot tell lies for he has seen and we shall see but they'll forget before we die",Dirt Band,1976,"[100, 74, 74, 77, 87]",5

Now once upon a time not long ago (Not long ago)
There was an ocker kicking rhymes up in the land of rock and roll
He's not a rocker, just a stoner on a roll (On a roll)
Goin' all out on the road and tryna make the honour roll
See I been all up in the dojo practicin' my braggadocio
Learned to toot my own horn, blow my saxophone and my oboe
Soprano, alto, baritone, mastered my high and low notes
A quick jazz cigarette then I'm takin' my solo
If you ain't heard about it ask around
On any given Sunday bet we turn the party out
Get love on every corner walkin' through our part of town
Yeah, you that lucky winner, Price Is Right and so you better come on down
To the inner west, come and visit the turf
You'll see my crew be runnin' Sydney like the City2Surf
From the pretty beach sides to the sticks in the 'burbs
They say ""that dude Smooth Nicholas, he slick with them words""

I was rollin' with my brosef and he turned and said to me
""Homie, you been goin' in since we was only seventeen""
I said ""I ain't one to blow my own, but I tend to agree
If ah, you know what I—you know what I mean, what I mean""
Now the punters say they love the way I spit it on the beat
It put the roof over my head and put the kicks up on my feet
Nothin' changed, still a couple snakes, we cut them blades of green
If ah, you know what I—you know what I mean

[Verse 2]
The sorta shit that they let fly, I could do with my eyes closed
But I'm taking the high road, tryna scale heights, never fall off cause I climb slow
See my sign's goat, as in G.O.A.T
Make my way from A to B while spelling out what's plain to see
My man was shotgun in the 'Yota, looked over and said to me
""Homie, you been goin' in since we was only seventeen""
When we'd rock up to your house party, rollin' twenty deep
Turnin' off your Black Eyed Peas and throwin' on some BDP
R.B.G, R.O.C, Eminem or D.R.E
R.S.E, BnE or Suffa, Pressure, and Debris
For the moment probably be that O.V.O or T.D.E
But homie this that O.N.E, that D.A.Y, that E.N.T
Nowadays we got our names up on the list and drinks are free
It's like something I think I saw in a vision or a dream
I'm tryna paint the kind of picture that make you picture the scene

But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough

246,Wheels Of Fortune,"I choke on my words as I speak
Brain damaged citizens file along the street
A view from my window
A motorway intersection
Exhaust pipes at pram level
Now playgrounds are carparks

Their feet hardly ever touch the ground
The tiger in the tank is a vile compound
Hold on to precious breath you're homeward bound
I've got to breathe, lead free
Breathe, lead free
Wheels keep rolling round and round
Their feet hardly ever touch the ground
The tiger in the tank is a vile compound
Hold on to precious breath you're homeward bound
I've got to breathe, high octane
Oh, oh, high octane
Wheels of Fortune keep rolling on

Dio come mi manca

Un'uscita con l'amica isa d
Lettere nascoste di segreti
E gli appuntamenti alle 4 sotto al bar
Con il motorino fino al centro giu in citta

Respiriamo l'aria e viviamo aspettando primavera
Siamo come fiori prima di vedere il sole a primavera

Ci sentiamo prigioniere della nostra età
Con i cuori in catene di felicità
Si, respiriamo nuovi amori
Aspettando che sia primavera

Mano nella mano a camminare
Occhi nei tuoi occhi amore amore
Cuori grandi sopra i muri disegnati
Con i nostri nomi scritti e innamorati
Mari di promesse fatte insieme
Vedrai ti aspetterò finchè vorrai
Un arrivederci dove e quando non si sa
Stesso posto stessa ora al centro giù in città

Respiriamo l'aria e viviamo aspettando primavera
Siamo come fiori prima di vedere il sole a primavera

Детка любит Partynextdoor
Знает меня на все 100
Она понимает меня без слов
Этой ночью я – твой ловец снов
Слушай меня и молчи
Я лучше знаю, чем ты
Какие к чёрту цветы?
Танцуй пока мы одни!
Говори – говори мне
Как ты любишь меня
Только нежно и плавно
Быстро снимай это, детка, с себя
Боже, как ты развратна!
Я хочу посмотреть ей в глаза
Но в ней всё по-другому-у
Она течёт от меня
И что, что, что?
Танцует голой!

Раздевайся и быстро в постель!
Мне это нравится
Делай ещё
Она опускается, и мне хорошо
Мы оставим это с тобой на потом
Я по e-mail скину альбом
Она готова бросить своих парней, услышав мой голос
Бейби течёт от меня
И-и-и танцует голой!

The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of

You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor when I break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Her beauman’s gone of a cool. Be good enough to symper-ise. If he’s at anywhere she’s therefor to join him. If it’s to no — where she’s going to too.

So and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for they are the ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel’s garland.
Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes, quicked out with selver. Pennyfair caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.

Say them all but tell them apart, cadenzando coloratura! R is Rubretta and A is Arancia, Y is for Yilla and N for greeneriN. B is Boyblue with odalisque O while W waters the fleurettes of no-vembrance. Though they’re all but merely a schoolgirl yet these way went they.

The grocer’s bawd she slips her hand in the haricot bag, the lady in waiting sips her sup from the paraffin can, Mrs Wildhare Quickdoctor helts her skelts up the casuaway the flasht instinct she herds if a tinkle of tunder, the widow Megrievy she knits cats’ cradles, this bountiful actress leashes a harrier under her tongue, and here’s the girl who she’s kneeled in coldfashion and she’s told her priest (spt!) she’s pot on a chap (chp!) and this lass not least, this rickissime woman, who she writes foot fortunes money times over in the nursery dust with her capital thumb. Buzz. All run-away sheep bound back bopeep, trailing their teenes behind them. And these ways wend they. And those ways went they. Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from foncey and pansey to papavere’s blush, foresake-me-nought, while there’s leaf there’s hope, with primtim’s ruse and marry-may’s blossom, all the flowers of the ancelles’ garden.

He was feeling so funny and floored for the cue, all over which girls as he don’t know whose hue. If goosseys gazious would but fain smile him a smile he would be fondling a praise he ate some nice bit of fluff. But no geste reveals the unconnouth. They’re all odds against him, the beasties.

He dove his head into Wat Murrey, gave Stewart Ryall a puck on the plexus, wrestled a hurry-come-union with the Gillie Beg, wiped all his sinses, martial and menial, out of Shrove Sundy MacFearsome, excremuncted as freely as any frothblower into MacIsaac, had a belting bout, chaste to chaste, with McAdoo about nothing and, childhood’s age being aye the shameleast, tel a Tartaran tastarin toothsome tarrascone tourtoun, vestimentiv-orous chlamydophagian, imbretellated himself for any time un tellable with what hung over to the Machonochie Middle from the MacSiccaries of the Breeks.

Every monk his own cashel where every little ligger is his own liogotenente with inclined jambs in full purview to his pronaose and to the deretane at his reredoss. Fuisfinister, fuyerescaper! He would, with the greatest of ease, before of weighting midhook, by dear home trashold on the raging canal, for othersites of Jorden, (heave a hevy, waterboy!) make one of hissens with a knockonacow and a chow collegions and fire off, gheol ghiornal, foull subustioned mullmud, his farced epistol to the hibruws.

Maleesh! He would bare to untired world of Leimunconon-nulstria (and what a strip poker globbtrottel they pairs would looks!) how wholefallows, his guffer, the sabbatarian (might faction split his beard!), he too had a great big oh in the megafundum of his tomashunders and how her Lettyshape, his gummer, that congealed sponsar, she had never cessed at waking malters among the jemassons since the duft that meataxe delt her made her microchasm as gap as down low.

With tears for his coronaichon, such as engines weep. Was liffe worth leaving? Nej!

Tholedoth, treetrene! Zokrahsing, stone! Arty, reminiscen-sitive, at bandstand finale on grand carriero, dreaming largesse of lifesighs over early lived offs — all old Sators of the Sowsceptre highly nutritius family histrionic, genitricksling with Avus and Avia, that simple pair, and descendant down on veloutypads by a vuncular process to Nurus and Noverca, those notorious nepotists, circumpictified in their sobrine census, patriss all of them by the glos on their germane faces and their socerine eyes like transparents of vitricus, patruuts to a man, the archimade levirs of his ekonome world.

But, by Jove Chronides, Seed of Summ, after at he had bate his breastplates for, forforget, forforgetting his birdsplace, it was soon that, that he, that he rehad himself. By a prayer? No, that comes later. By contrite attrition? Nay, that we passed. Mid esercizism? So is richt.
And it was so. And Malthos Moramor resumed his soul. With: Go Ferchios off to Allad out of this! An oldsteinsong. He threwed his fit up to his aers, rolled his poligone eyes, snivelled from his snose and blew the guff out of his hornypipe. The hopjoimt jerk of a ladle broom jig that he learned in locofoco when a redhot turnspite he. Under reign of old Roastin the Bowl Ratskillers, readyos! Why was that man for he’s doin her wrong! Lookery looks, how he’s knots in his entrails! Mookery mooks, it’s a grippe of his gripes. Seekeryseeks, why his biting he’s head off? Cokerycokes, it’s his spurt of coal. And may his tarpitch dilute not give him chromitis! For the mauwe that blinks you blank is mostly Carbo. Where the inflammabilis might pursuive his com-burenda with a pure flame and a true flame and a flame all too — gasser, soot. The worst is over. Wait! And the dubuny Mag may gang to preesses. With Dinny Finneen, me canty, ho! In the lost of the gleamens. Sousymoust. For he would himself deal a treat-ment as might be trusted in anticipation of his inculmination unto fructification for the major operation.

Like things are m. ds. is all in vincibles. Decoded.

Now a run for his money! Now a dash to her dot! Old cocker, young crowy sifadda, sosson. A bran new, speedhount, out-stripperous on the wind. Like a waft to wingweary one or a sos to a coastguard. For directly with his whoop, stop and an upa-lepsy didando a tishy, in appreciable less time than it takes a glaciator to submerger an Atlangthis, was he again, agob, before the trembly ones, a spark’s gap off, doubledasguesched, gotten orlop in a simplasailormade and shaking the storm out of his hiccups. The smartest vessel you could find would elazilee him on her knee as her lucky for the Rio Grande. He’s a pigtaiI tarr and if he hadn’t got it toothick he’d a telltale tall of his pitcher on a wall with his photure in the papers for cutting moutonlegs and capers, letting on he’d jest be japers and his tail cooked up.

Goal! It’s one by its length.

And he did a get, their anayance, and slink his hook away, aleguere come alaguerre. like a chimista inchamisas, whom the harricana hurries and hots foots, zingo, zango, segur.

Of all the green heroes everwore coton breiches, the whitemost, the goldenest!

Goof!

Hymnumber twentynine. O, the singing! Happy little girly-cums to have adolphted such an Adelphus! O, the swinginging hopops so goholden! They’ve come to chant en chor. They say their salat, the madiens’ prayer to the messiager of His Nabis, prostitating their selfs eachwise and combinedly. Fateha, fold the hands. Be it honoured, bow the head. May thine evings e’en be blossful! Even of bliss! As we so hope for ablution. For the sake of the farbung and of the scent and of the holiodrops. Amems.

A pause. Their orison arises misquewhite as Osman glory, ebbing wasteward, leaves to the soul of light its fading silence (allah — lah lahlah lah!), a turquewashed sky. Then:

Red bricks are all hellishly good values if you trust to the roster of ads but we’ll save up ourselves and nab what’s nicest and boskiest of timber trees in the nebohood. Oncaill’s plot. Luccombe oaks, Turkish hazels, Greek firs, incense palm edcedras. The hypso-meters of Mount Anville is held to be dying out of arthataxis but, praise send Larix U’ Thule, the wych elm of Manelagh is still flourishing in the open, because its native of our nature and the seeds was sent by Fortune. We’ll have our private palypeachum pillarposterns for lovesick letterines fondly affianxed to our front railings and swings, hammocks, tighttaught balletlines, accomoda-tionnooks and prismic bathboites, to make Envyeyes mouth water and wonder when they binocular us from their embrassured windows in our garden rare.

You mustn’t miss it or you’ll be sorry. Charmeuses chloes, glycering juwells, lydialight fans and puffumed cynarettes. And the Prince Le Monade has been graciously pleased. His six choco-late pages will run bugling before him and Cococream toddle after with his sticksword in a pink cushion. We think His Spark-ling Headiness ought to know Lady Marmela. Luisome his for lissome hers. He’s not going to Cork till Cantalamesse or may-hope till Rose Easter or Saint Tibble’s Day. So Niomon knows. The Fomor’s in his Fin, the Momor’s her and hin.

Since the days of Roamaloose and Rehmoose the pavanos have been strident through their struts of Chapelldiseut, the vaulsies have meed and youdled through the purly ooze of Ballybough, many a mismy cloudy has tripped taintily along that hercourt strayed reelway and the rigadoons have held ragtimed revels on the platauplain of Grangegorman; and, though since then ster-lings and guineas have been replaced by brooks and lions and some progress has been made on stilts and the races have come and gone and Thyme, that chef of seasoners, has made his usual astewte use of endadjustables and whatnot willbe isnor was, those danceadeils and cancanzanies have come stimmering down for our begayment through the bedeafdom of po’s taeorns, the obcecity of pa’s teapucs, as lithe and limbfree limber as when momie mummed at ma.

263,Another Rainy Day In New York City,"Listen to the radio
A voice on the early show says I'm not alone
It's just another rainy day in New York City
And the rain comes pouring down
Like early morning strangers we had nothing left to say but
""See you round""
And I think of the night when it all felt so right
How was I supposed to know?
Now your feeling's gone cause when I call on the phone
You told the operator say ""Sorry, no-one's home""
It's another rainy day in New York City
At night those city lights they sure look pretty
I held my candle to the wind and watched my dreams just sail away
With another rainy day in New York City
To think that only yesterday
Life was such an easy game that I could play
Now it's another rainy day in New York City
And the rain comes pouring down
So I'm on my own and the radio says
That the sun ain't gonna shine
With the words you said spinnin' round in my head
You know I can't find a way to get you out of my mind
It's another rainy day in New York City
At night those city lights they sure look pretty
I held my candle to the wind and watched my dreams just sail away
With another rainy day in New York City
It's another rainy day in New York City

Is keep believing
There's someone in this crazy world for me
The way that people come and go
Through temporary lives
My chance could come and I might never know

Let's keep it simple""
But freedom only helps you say good-bye
It took a while for me to learn
That nothing comes for free
The price I've paid is high enough for me

I know I need to be in love
I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of
A quite imperfect world
And fool enough to think that's what I'll find

So here I am with pockets full of good intentions
But none of them will comfort me tonight
I'm wide awake at four a.m
Without a friend in sight
Hanging on a hope but I'm alright

I know I've wasted too much time
I know I ask perfection of

Let me tell you bout what I love in Gina
Love is like no other couldn't get in between her
Always stayed fly man I wished that you seen her
Said they had a scheme but nobody believed her
No real job cause she stay in the streets
Gina did nails but her love made beats
When they wanna eat they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted man the illest you saw
Til one day they went up kindin fiendin with ice
Butter like(?) the jeans and Gina said ""The rings are nice""
Next thing you know they wanna pull off a heist
Shook took a look and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shinin as they flew in the air
Butter actin up and grabbin stuff by the pair
Gina at the door cause she good with the gun
They both grabbed the money and run

Spoonie was a rookie that was new on the scene
Used to be a thug now he's doin it clean
Ironic he was coppin and they gave him the spot
Knew Butter back from Hollis used to chill on the block
Seen Butter round the way with a brand new Benz
Gina lookin pretty in the city with friends
Spoonie's sayin yo I gotta get these ends
And these are the two I gotta apprehend
A big boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long long trail
Spoonie saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin sayin somethin like she don't got bail
Butter said promise me I won't see jail
Spoonie want a watch and a brand new cell
Butter and Gina moved to Pensacola
Spoonie got a Roley and a Motorola

All I can say is about the story
Is livin like Butter Love is not for me

I love your salty taste
I love your finger tips

L'ora ormai finita e la mia mente va
Una settimana intera
E oggi lo vedrò
Dio come mi manca
Giuro non lo lascerò

Un'uscita con l'amica isa d
Lettere nascoste di segreti
E gli appuntamenti alle 4 sotto al bar
Con il motorino fino al centro giu in citta

Respiriamo l'aria e viviamo aspettando primavera
Siamo come fiori prima di vedere il sole a primavera

Ci sentiamo prigioniere della nostra età
Con i cuori in catene di felicità
Si, respiriamo nuovi amori
Aspettando che sia primavera

Mano nella mano a camminare
Occhi nei tuoi occhi amore amore
Cuori grandi sopra i muri disegnati
Con i nostri nomi scritti e innamorati
Mari di promesse fatte insieme
Vedrai ti aspetterò finchè vorrai
Un arrivederci dove e quando non si sa
Stesso posto stessa ora al centro giù in città

Respiriamo l'aria e viviamo aspettando primavera
Siamo come fiori prima di vedere il sole a primavera
(2 volte)(two times)

Ci sentiamo prigioniere della nostra eta'
Con i cuori in catene di felicità
Si,respiriamo nuovi amori
Aspettando che sia primavera

Respiriamo l'aria e viviamo aspettando primavera
Siamo come fiori prima di vedere ilsole a primavera

Tu dimmi che mi vuoi ancora, dimmi che mi vuoi
Tu dimmi non mi lascerai io non ti lascero'
Tu dimmi che mi vuoi ancora, dimmi che mi vuoi
Tu dimmi non mi lascerai io non ti lascero'

292,Never Gonna Fall In Love Again,"[Verse 1]
Something snapped me out of a dream that I was having
I'd fallen down an elevator shaft but now I'm back again
Tidying up after the fight we had (Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again)

Happy with yourself, well you've never looked so satisfied
Teasing me with stuff like a spoilt little brother
You finished yet? Have you got what you really want? (Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again)

Never gonna fall in love again, never gonna fall in love again

I've spent enough time alone
Up in my bedroom at home
Been kinda bored lately
I hate on all I see

You could help me down the rabbit hole with you
I could go with you
You could lead the way I'd go hand in hand with you

I just need a friend
So much to carry

Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said ""I'm here to do sink repairs.""
Chop her up, put her body parts
In front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there

But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody

Got nothin' to do with me

Woke up, it was dawn, musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on, there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
Girl, that motherfuckin' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly

Spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap, lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher

Just escaped from the state pen
For [edited] eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's play pen, I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho: I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see ...

304,Kid Charlemagne,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
While the music played you worked by candlelight
Those San Francisco nights
You were the best in town
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl
You turned it on the world
That's when you turned the world around

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you feel like Jesus?
Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

[Verse 2]
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all
You'd go to L.A. on a dare
And you'd go it alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could you live forever?
Could you see the day?
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?

[Chorus]
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne

[Verse 3]
Now your patrons have all left you in the red
Your low rent friends are dead
This life can be very strange
All those Day-Glo freaks who used to paint the face
They've joined the human race
Some things will never change

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Son, you were mistaken
You are obsolete
Look at all the white men on the street

[Chorus]
Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne

[Guitar solo: Larry Carlton]

[Verse 4]
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale
Just get them all out of here
Is there gas in the car
Yes, there's gas in the car
I think the people down the hall
Know who you are

[Pre-Chorus 4]
Careful what you carry
'Cause the man is wise
You are still an outlaw in their eyes

Get along
Get along, Kid Charlemagne
Get along, Kid Charlemagne",Steely Dan,1976,"[88, 82, 87]",3
305,Livin' Ain't Livin',"All the empty words I've spoken
All the promises I've broken
All the lovers and the loves I've pushed away
Now they all come back to haunt me
And the silence seem to taunt me
'Cause they turned the tables round the other way

Livin' is easy with someone who cares
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone ain't livin' alone

Did I turn my back so coldly
On the ones who trie to hold me
Saying only that I needed to be free
Now I know some dreams were shattered
Because I never thought it mattered
No I never thought of anything but me

Livin' is easy with someone who cares
Someone to call you their own
Livin' is lovely with somebody there
Livin' ain't livin' alone ain't livin' alone

Have I taken all my chances
Will there be no more romances
Did I make my choice and never even know
But I'm much too young for endings
So I have to keep pretending
That tomorrow is the day my love will show",Firefall,1976,"[93, 42, 42, 46, 50, 62, 72, 83]",8

309,Silver Star,"Born into freedom, they remind me
To go and protect it blindly
All of your life is depending
On who and what you're defending

Move in for the kill, 'til they finally get their fill

Raised to believe all the hatred
While all of the innocence faded
Trust in yourself to follow
The lies just get harder to swallow

Move in for the kill, 'til they finally get their fill

Lay down your life
For what you are
Live the sacrifice
For a silver star

Die with the best of intentions
Led to the end by perception
All of our lives are depending
On who and what we're defending

Lay down your life
For what you are
Live the sacrifice
For a silver star

Lay down your life
You've come this far
Sacrifice, trade your life
For a silver star

My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door

You know that I'm not that strong

Tell me girl, do you understand how rare it is indeed
Just to know who you are?
Oh, tell me girl, what’s in your heart?
I know it’s hard, can you play a part?
Can you take your mind off the silly things
Keep your eye on the ball?

'Bout nobody comin round here
Getting none of this, or takin’ your spot

On my timeline, seeing who is new

Yeah I see a lot of people
But baby I want you

Yeah baby I choose
All I wanna do is be around you
Don’t you worry ‘bout the old
Cause we’re on to the new
Ain’t studdin’ them, ‘cause I’m thinkin’ ‘bout you
Know that nothing can come between
What we have and what we do
So for the times that I’m gone
Know that this much is true
Baby you are not alone
So I’m asking you

And she said, “No, I think about the times we ain’t together”
I said “Oh”
What in the world are we tryna do?
What we tryna say?
What we tryna prove?

As long as the homie sing a song or two
Baby it’s true, I’ma see a whole lot of people
But baby I want you

318,I'll Get Over You,"One thing 'bout this heart of mine
All my hurts got a mending time
It dont leave no scars behind
I'll get over you

I'll find me a guy one day
Who's not scared to give his heart away
When I do
It's safe to say that I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

From now on think
I'll lay low
I'll talk fast
But I'll move slow

You taught me all I need to know
'Bout gettin over you
Sometimes I think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
But I know it's just untill I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

Sometimes think I love you still
Wonder if I always will
Love for you's so hard to kill
But I'll get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you

I'll get over you
I'll get through it when I do
I'll be good as new
When I get over you",Crystal Gayle,1976,"[100, 71, 72, 74, 75, 83]",6
319,I Wanna Stay With You,"VERSE
All the times you stood by me
All the ways you paved a path to guide my wanderings
All the kindnesses etched within my searching mind
Made a way for me to see

CHORUS 1
Come rest your head next to mine.We'll watch the summer sky change gracefully
Don't be a stranger this time when you could be mine. We'll face the world together

Verse
I was so blind but now I see
Your beauty such rare reality
I was so scare to find whatever it was you showed to me
But it's all I ever wanted

CHORUS 2
Come take a seat next to mine.We'll watch the ocean line get higher and higher
Please rest your bones next to mine whenever you die. I wanna stay with you forever

Holding on to this strange philosophy

320,Crazy On You,"We may still have time, you may still get by
Every time I think about it I wanna cry
With these bombs and devils and the kids keep coming
Nowhere to breathe easy and no time to be young

But I tell myself, yeah, that I'm doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight

But go crazy on you, gonna go crazy on you
Gonna go crazy, crazy on you

My love is the evening breeze touching your skin
The gentle sweet singing of leaves in the wind
The whisper that calls after you in the night
And kisses your ear in the early light

You don't need to wonder, yeah, you're doing just fine
And my love, okay, the pleasure's mine

Let me go crazy on you, let me go crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane?
So afraid of wanting, so afraid of you
What you gonna do?

Gonna go crazy on you, gonna go crazy on you
Gonna go crazy, crazy on you

I was a willow last night in my dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you keep me alive with your sweet, flowing love

Crazy on you, let me go crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Let me go crazy on you, just go crazy on you
Just go crazy, crazy on you",Blitzen Trapper,1976,"[76, 70, 71, 71, 49, 35, 37, 43, 50, 55, 65, 76, 86]",13

322,I Hope We Get To Love In Time,"[Billy Davis Jr]
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you; I couldn't stand the pain

[Marilyn McCoo]
The road to love has tragedies
Some loves don't get to be
Laying the tears in someone's eyes, I won't cry

[Billy Davis Jr]
And it could happen to us if we're not strong
So why don't we hurry to love before it's gone

[Chorus]
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain

[Marilyn McCoo]
The gates are open, we're so close
Love is almost ours to hold
A few more steps and we'll be there, if you care

[Billy Davis Jr]
We'll make it together, it's easier that way
With two falling deeper love will soon be ours to stay

[Chorus]
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain",Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr,1976,"[91, 91, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 98]",8
323,"Rain, Oh Rain","[Verse 1]
Ever since the rain I’ve been waking on my own
Left an empty space in a home we built to grow
Watching waves at night I fell into the blue
I guess I lost the light, now I’ve given all my love to you

[Chorus]
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you

[Verse 2]
Ever since the rain I’ve been living days too slow
Lie around and wait for a heart I used to know
They say that over time there’ll be nothing left to lose
But I still can’t find the light, I’ve given all my love to you

[Chorus]
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my love to you
I’ve given all my, given all my love to you
I’ve given all my love to you

324,Breaker - Breaker,"[Chorus: GZA]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 1: GZA]
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the Frisbee, Digi they Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute. He had the heat in his
Hand, but yo he didn't shoot, therefore
Your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger
Linger, linger, linger, linger

[Chorus]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 2: GZA]
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

[Chorus]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

325,Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow?

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic in your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You said that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night)
Meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?",Carole King,1976,"[95, 95, 97, 99]",4
326,Who Loves You Better - Part 1,"[Verse One]
She ran out the house like, ""Fuck it I'm leaving""
He ran out after her like ""Fuck is the meaning?""
Went through his phone and found texts from all his ex's
Threw it at him like, ""Fuck was you thinking?""
Way down in his stomach he's getting that sinking
Feeling he felt 20 years before when
His pops sat him down and told him and his mom was divorcing
Now he's doing the same
Running through these hoes with no proper decorum
Not a pretty picture
Unsettled miser-y, he would say his pop was a dog
Now ain't that the pot calling the kettle ""nigga""
Every player dreams of leaving the game, straight walking out
The allure of new pussy is cool, but when it's over what the fuck you got to talk about?
Such an empty feeling, you win or you lose
Wifey told him, ""It's them or me and baby, you better choose.""
Hey!

[Hook: Eric Robinson]
I saw the clouds today and thought that it was time to say goodbye
(Who loves you more? Who loves you more?) (Every little thing about you babe)
I tried to change my ways and pray that maybe I can save my life
(Who loves you more? Who loves you more?) (Every little thing about you babe)

[Verse Two]
My cousin hit me up and said he had to post bail again
Cause my brother back in jail again
Back in that slave ship cause he tried to sell again
And all that’s going through my mind is ""How the fuck am I failing him?""
These youngins want all of the spoils but none of the toils
Got me climbing the walls
Too good to press olives but’ll be the first squeaky wheel asking for oil
I’ve been at it for 10 years, ""What the fuck is you on?""
Had me frustrated like, ""What the fuck do you want?""
He come to me for answers but I don’t know what to tell him
Part bad parenting, part youthful rebellion
He wanna buy a dream but I don’t know what to sell him, shit
They say the streets turn niggas into sinners
But them jail cells be turning niggas into dinner
So they sing in the summer, be home by the winter
Interrogation room be turning niggas into tenors
And he’s no singer, but put him on the block, he got that perfect pitch
I just want him to understand that you work for this
You can win or you lose
But it’s either me or the streets and brother you gotta choose
Love

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Some get hand picked, others get picked on
Some get a hand up, others get disarmed
I came from the bottom where the guns got withdrawn
All lows, no highs man, get a stiff arm
See me doing records so they think it makes a lot
But really I'm just trying to make Salat like I was raised Islam
Praying that the ends justify the means
Cause most of my heroes had fucked up lives
Coked up kids and three or four wives
Hoes in every city, enough side bitches for three or four tribes
From Marvin to Basquiat, it comes with a caveat
And that's the gospel like three or four choirs
Gotta room with a microphone and all this time
I just sat by the window and looked inside
Didn't like what I found, but you win or you lose
Make a living or have a life, guess that I gotta choose
One...

[Hook]

[Outro]
I got a room and a microphone
And family that I ain't seen in months
And I played this record a million times, just hoping you would play it once
Ha, break bread with your fellow man
Show love but look out for your heart
And always take care of home
Because home is where charity starts
Because home is where charity starts
Home is where charity starts

If Papa were here I'm sure he'd tell her

She always loved to swim away
Maybe she'll find an island with a shaded tree
Just like the one in our backyard

Mama tries hard to pretend
Things will get better again
Somehow she's keeping it all inside her
But finally the tears fill our eyes
And I know that somewhere tonight

Voglio un picnic, fanculo Just Eat
Timberlake o Bieber, l'importante è che sia just in
Non guardarmi così, I'm a rich bitch
Ti interrompo la festa come un cazzo di blitz
Yeah, give me five, perché il mondo è bello
Non capisco se è un casello o un McDrive
Baci baci, bye
Con la tua gang mai
Se mi stai lontano è meglio, tu e le tue bad vibe
I miei fratelli fumano come se fosse sport
A te non ti vediamo perché c'è troppo smog
Guarda che noi non ti odiamo, siamo peace and love
Il flow ti ha travolta, baby, come John
Tiriamo forte, ci crediamo a San Siro
Gas soporifero e reclama il condominio
Se arrivano le guardie noi giochiamo a nascondino
Sei pronto a prenderle? Scegli: classico o alternativo
Uh, ho gli occhi addosso come Monna Lisa
Mia mamma conosce tua madre, non sei mia cugina
La pensilina dice che è in arrivo e non arriva
Nel mio quartiere non funziona la tua hit estiva

332,Norma Jean Wants To Be A Movie Star,"She was born in L.A
In a lonely room
Hardly knew her mama
And her daddy left too soon

She never seemed to fit in with the other kids around
Late at night
She took out her pen
And this is what she wrote down:

Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
""We know who you are""

Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life

By the time she turned sixteen
She was twenty-one
Knew every name on the silver screen
And everything they'd done

But when it came time to lay herself down to dream
It wasn't them she saw up there
It was ""Norma Jean""

Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
""We know who you are""

Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life

Before too long
She had her fortune and fame
But it wasn't Norma Jean
Marilyn was her name

She died in L.A. in a lonely room
Nobody knew her
But they knew she died too soon

By the time it was too late
Lord, we began to care
If you can hear me now
This is my prayer

I see the girls in the club, they gettin' wild for me
And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat - drop I know they gon' lean
World debut, I know they gon' fiend

Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys don't know what a don mean

Win so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat

I was thinking possibly or maybe
We could head back to your crib
Not where I live you see

I'm still living with my mom and my dad
But really I'm going places
Even though I'm seeing three of your faces
Please, God, let's not resort to mini-mall parking spaces

(Chorus)
Encounters with police, with my hands in the air
Encounters with police
Why ask if you don't care

I just had no idea that this would be lasting for just one single moment

I just have to say, you look so goddamn good
I give you crazy mad props, because I know I should
OK, I'm a bit intoxicated, but really I just graduated
And from where my hands are situated
Obviously, I'm growing more and more infatuated
Just wait, please wait

(Chorus)
We could be like onions and peppers
In a sleeping bag fajita
We could be anything you want
The way you're busting out of that wife-beater
And I know it's a bit uncomfortable here in this 2-door seater
But you're just the right size, and baby, yeah
And I will always feed you and feed you and feed you

345,Happy Man (Pt. I),"Jedyni ludzie jakich znoszę to ci w filmach - nieznajomi
Ich historie, w tych książek - ich emocje, nastroje
Ich przeżycia, przygody w tych miastach nieznanych
Choć w niektórych byłem, to widocznie minąłem się z czasami
W złej epoce urodzony jak August III Sas
Mam ochotę ludzi wygonić. Niech nie plączą się po ulicach
Niech nie zawadzają mi, akurat wtedy gdy ja mam nastrój
Wypić whiskey na rynku rzeszowskim jeszcze przed dwunastą
Wziąć Sylimarol, usiąść w knajpie z najbliższą mi damą
Bo to jeszcze jedna z osób, które znoszę przed śniadaniem
I zjeść z nią. Zjeść ją wzorkiem i przenieść do pokoju
By nasycić inne zmysły tylko dlatego, ze jestem w nastroju na to
Jak David Bourne. A ona bez sprzeciwu, ulega chwili
Bo jest taki klimat, bo jest ku temu nastrój, bo zima
Bo jest miło. Jest fantastycznie! czytaj: nierealnie
W każdej strofie mam nastrój, co już wprawia w szał mnie

[Hookx2]
Ja się nie dopasuje jeszcze przez długi czas
Możesz mówić, że z chujem zamieniłem sie mózgiem, ale ja
Zwyczajnie cenie wolność. Wolność!! niech wybrzmiewa...
Być sobie sterem Bez patentu sternika!

[Verse 2.]
Przestałem wierzyć w marzenia. Jak dotąd jeszcze nic
Nie przekonało mnie, że się spełniają. W głowie jeszcze tkwi, więc jeszcze dziś
Jednak będę się starał, bo co mi zostaje?
Jak bym nie działał, to i tak tu wszystko idzie na marne
Wszystko chuj!
""Wszystko fajnie"" - tak sobie poprawiam samopoczucie
No, dobra... próbuję - bezskutecznie, więc znów muszę się uciec
Do czyichś wielkich, pięknych, nabrzmiałych... przeżyć. (Już raźniej!)
Na białym papierze słowa nabrały barw przez pryzmat wyobraźni
Teraz mam inny wymiar - teraz już kumasz jak to bywa?
Chce mieć buena vida international z zapasem wina
Bez niezgrabnych upierdliwców, nieznośnych słów - tak po prostu
W mojej wyobraźni to ""Rajski ogród"" w proszku
Mam jeden cel w życiu, to być szczęśliwym - jedna myśl!
Każdy kawałek mógłbym nagrać o tym
Każdy numer mógłbym nazwać jak Latin Blues Band, The
(I'll Be A) Happy Man - dążę by usunąć nawias, bo kiedyś nim będę
""Happy Man""

[Break]

[Verse 3.]
Ale zanim będę happy man, strzelam jak ten ślepy w cel
W dupie mam recepty te, bo to ja tu lepiej wiem
Co dla sumienia jest dobre. strzelam więc z impetem, man
Bo jestem kurwa głodny. Chcę tej mety, ej you'll make my day!
To już nie są marzenia. Zwyczajnie nie ma innej opcji
Już nie chcę narzekać, doceniać chcę te gesty pomocne
Może to kwestia emocji. Zresztą już mocniejszych nie oczekuję
To, co tu jest buduje, mimo, że chcą mi to tu jebnąć
Brnąć będę mimo to. Przed chwilą coś
Mi kłody pod nogi chciało rzucić, a ja wbijam w to
To próchno mi nie przeszkodzi. Ominę to, lub przeskoczę
Nie wpasuję się? Może to minie, może się stoczę
Wiem, że na tej drodze mam luksus - przecieram sobie szlak
I choć czasem zbocze z kursu i wciąż przybieram nowy kształt
Nie przeszkodzą mi ani ci ludzie z ulic, ani ten wtórny pesymizm
Bo w końcu jestem tu od siedmiu lat, a nie od chwili",Michał Tomasik,1976,"[94, 98]",2

When I come home, baby
And I've been working all night long
I put my daughter on my knee, and she said
""Daddy, what's wrong?""
She whispered in my ear so sweet

""Daddy, you're a fool to cry
You're a fool to cry
And it makes me wonder why
Daddy, you're a fool""

[Verse 2]
You know, I've got a woman (Daddy, you're a fool)
And she live in the poor part of town
And I go see her sometimes
And we make love, so fine
I put my head on her shoulder
She said, ""Tell me all your troubles""
You know what she said? She said

352,Show Me The Way,"[Intro: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy I hope and I pray
Show me the way

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way

[Verse 1: Evidence]
I say hello to my people, hello to the day
I watch the world on wheels, hit the yellow and gray
The ones don't work are the ones don't eat
And once again, from the city where that sun don't sleep
It's time to get live because the terms is breached
Ride the wave like the world is a beach, learn more I teach
I was raised by N.W.A and stayed CA
All day, same story, different brief case
I'm nonchalant to others peddling weight
I got a purpose to serving up and settle my state
Been through it, all of it great
Put the ruler to the movement, all of it straight
Big fish? Even calling them bait
One love, one dish, see 'em all on my plate
I'll take the lady on a vacay, she call it a date
Now she calling in sick, now she calling in late

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It's a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way

[Verse 2: Rakaa Iriscience]
The moon tagged the sun in, love to be alive
Feet hit the ground running, butterflies in my stomach
Like I'm anxious trying to get it, trying to learn a lot from it
On a planet in regression, in a loft at the summit
Air is much clearer, catch me on the high road
Some fight to live, others settle for survival
It's your world, you can write the line you live your life on
It's heavy but you're strong, just hold on until that light dawns
It's started now, pardon me we're partying
Escalating, redefining the state of the art again
Celebrated, elevators open up to secret floors
Different rules and secret laws, from the roof you'll see the stars
Only fear boredom in a world of raw materials
Excited by potential, inspired by adventure
Calculated circles, the circumference and the radius
The only cats that float without a float through the parade is us

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray
Somebody show me the way
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way
I've been through some pitfalls that knocked me down
Made it through close calls and lost some ground
It's a hell of a price I pay
Somebody show me the way, somebody show me the way

[Verse 3]

[Evidence]
It's routine, by the beach I rise
First up, I hit the weed then I bleach my eyes
Then it's to the drum machine to speak my mind
Tracks like fitted hats, pick a beat my size

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Energizing, on the darkest streets I shine
Saw the light up on the mountain, to the peak I climbed
Breathtaking new perspectives on the life I grind
First tear of joy fell, looking like I'm crying
For a just a moment

[Evidence]
The feeling of being content
Not needing a dollar or a cent
Smile for my mama cause she proud
The studio, my headphones loud

[Rakaa Iriscience]
Bridge builders will connect these crowds
Dedicated on my honor you can check these vows
That's purpose, power to make the powerful nervous
Hard work ain't easy but easy usually ain't worth it
They say

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
The harder the work well the longer the day
Easy may come but it sure don't stay
Trying to cope, boy, I hope and I pray

353,Love In The Shadows,"In the shadows, you've got to know your lover mostly by feel
You've got to put your faith in things you can touch
If you dare to

Cos the shadows, can make you crazy with the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much
Scare the hell out of you

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows

In the shadows, you've got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around

Cos the shadows, can play a half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never be free
It just kinda drags you down

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow

A poor man's made out of muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

[Verse 2]
I was born one morning when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number 9 coal
And the straw boss said, ""Well-a bless my soul!""

Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the cane break by an old mama lion
Can't no high-toned woman make me walk the line

Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin' better step aside
A lot of men didn't, a lot of men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

356,The Hungry Years,"Boy, we made it to the top
We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together building castles in the air

We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the right would turn out bad
Everything we wanted was everything we had

I miss the hungry years, the once upon a time
The lovely long ago, we didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you, we lost along the way

How could I be so blind, not to see the door
Closing on the world I now hunger for
Looking through my tears, I miss the hungry years

We shared our day dreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
Things that we were after were much better from afar

And here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Baby, take me home, let's go back to yesterday

I miss the hungry years, the once upon a time
The lovely long ago, we didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you, we lost along the way

How could I be so blind, not to see the door
Closing on the world I now hunger for

360,One Piece At A Time,"Well, I left Kentucky back in '49
An' went to Detroit workin' on a 'sembly line
The first year they had me puttin' wheels on cadillacs

Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head and cry
'Cause I always wanted me one that was long and black

One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any man
I'd sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand
Now gettin' caught meant gettin' fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I retired
I'd have me a car worth at least a hundred grand

(CHORUS)
I'd get it one piece at a time
And it wouldn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is a round

So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunchbox and with help from my friends
I left that day with a lunch box full of gears
Now, I never considered myself a thief
GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years

The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all of the chrome
The little things I could get in my big lunchbox
Like nuts, an' bolts, and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home

Now, up to now my plan went all right
'Til we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong

The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone

So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help with an A-daptor kit
We had that engine runnin' just like a song
Now the headlight' was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on

The back end looked kinda funny too
But we put it together and when we got thru
Well, that's when we noticed that we only had one tail-fin
About that time my robot walked out
And I could see in it's eyes that it had it's doubts
But it opened the door and said ""Destroy all humans.""

So we drove up town just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughin' for blocks around
But up there at the court house they didn't laugh
'Cause to type it up it took the whole staff
And when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds

(CHORUS)
I got it one piece at a time
And it didn't cost me a dime
You'll know it's me when I come through your town
I'm gonna ride around in style
I'm gonna drive everybody wild
'Cause I'll have the only one there is around

Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You young, young blood

So when you’re mad for no reason
At everything at once
And when you start overthinking
I’ll be drinking at home

So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle

[Bridge]
And if you want, I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
In the morning, I’m bullet proof
And if you want, I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
In the morning, I’m bullet proof
In the morning, I’m bullet proof

365,Still Crazy After All These Years,"[Verse 1]
I met my old lover on the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me, I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers

[Chorus]
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

[Verse 2]
I’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on old familiar ways
And I ain’t no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears

[Chorus]
Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

[Bridge]
Four in the morning
Crapped out, yawning
Longing my life away
I’ll never worry
Why should I?
It’s all gonna fade

[Verse 3]
Now I sit by my window, and I watch the cars
I fear I’ll do some damage one fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers

Oh, still crazy

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye

You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look

But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me

Used to be the quiet kid in the sandbox

You oughta stop me coming in again
You mad? You thought we were synonyms?
Too bad, that's the water you're gettin' in
You're too fat for the sharks that you're swimming in
From where I'm sitting, contenders are lookin'
Like fruit spinnin' around in a blender
Hardly a snack when I'm here lookin' for dinner
I eat 'em, delete 'em, they're barely beginners
Main course is my main sport
Play major, but Minor's my main Fort
Put a chain around everything I came for
Look, but don't touch, sucker
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Say they want respect now
Thinking they deserve to have it next now
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Believing what they're makin' up
Talking loud, but never really sayin' much
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
I been drawin' plans out
And they think I'm givin' them a handout
Tell 'em take an I.O.U
Thinking they're entitled to a piece, no, I don't think so
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

[Verse 2]
Levitatin' in the blackout
Used to drink at least a forty 'fore we mashed out
Used to think that workin' forty was a max-out
Now I'm workin' even when I'm sleepin', do the math now
'Cause even when I'm sleepin', eyes keep 'em open
Stripe across 'em both the color of your hemoglobin
A huge act man like I'm known for being Logan
X-23 I’m keen to leave 'em with a femur broken
Takin' it too far, maybe
Friends like “Mike, I don't know who you are lately”
But pride and hate has made naysayers mistake me
For wasting brain space on ratings they gave me
I don't need your respect, I got history
I'm ‘81 Reagan with that nonsense, miss me
Father like Francis, Anakin or John Misty
Not to be touched, sucker
Tell 'em take an I.O.U

Say they want respect now
Thinking they deserve to have it next now

It makes me giggle
Sometimes I wiggle
Sometimes I even jump for joy, child

He gives me love and calls me Daddy

It makes me giggle

My escape from everything
Please say you'll be my nothing
And I will give you everything
Man, you are really something else
You caught me at an awful time
See I just lost my smile
And that is what you helped me find
Hadn't seen it in a while
And then you
Came to save the day and I must say
I think you may have done some more
God damn you
Stay on my mind like all the time
So every night I end up at your door
Hope that's cool
'Cause I'm really not trying to
Impose but I suppose that
I'm supposed to be here
With you
With eyes as sad as mine, I think you'll find
You need me just like I need you, yeah

But it's cool
We ain't gotta be nothing
It's true
I'd actually prefer it, yeah

It's on you, it's on you, it's on you
It's on you, cause I'm cool

At first, I was just tryna fuck

Together till the end of time

386,Better Days,"[Verse 1]
I just want you to know that I'm stuck in your soul
Funny how last week I thought it couldn't be so
What I see in your eyes words can't come close
No matter what your father says I just want you to know
That you're a beautiful person, and I want you to grow
The way he talks to you's just so inappro
I hope that you're strong, when he's doing you wrong
And I hope you find comfort in the words of these songs
Now sing along and while I tell you this story just listen closely
I know you like my music but look, you don't really know me
See I live outside the city where there's nothing going on
I just look around for meaning while I'm sitting on my lawn
One day I met this girl and she was beautiful too
I look closely at her eyes, a nice light shade of blue
She was still in high school, I was one year removed
We're both a little older from the things we've been through
Pretty soon I started seeing all the things he would do
She wasn't black and blue but emotionally bruised
It made me so mad I didn't know what to do
Told her no matter what, I'mma be there for you
But as things became more hectic in my life I started fadin' out
Began to lie to her, I wasn't fair to her, I hate it now
I hope that you can understand my honesty
I really fuckin' wanna knock that dude out honestly
You don't have to believe it but I think about you every day
I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 2]
I wanna go back where we were sittin' at that ice cream shop
I'm lookin' at you in your eyes I'm feelin' like my heart has stopped
You laugh at me for gettin' soy peanut butter
Back then I thought (shit, nah)
I don't need no other person in my life and nothing else don't even matter to me
Maybe I'm so numb that nothin' bad can ever happen to me
Maybe I'm so evil I attract all of these tragedies
Maybe we're so graceful we create all of these masterpieces
So facetious we would laugh about it
Nobody can reach us for a half an hour sleepin' in my half-apartment we don't have to watch the news
I never felt more comfortable my face so close to you
And I'mma break it down for you
I think about you every day I sing about you every way cause you're the perfect melody
I know the world ain't perfect but to me you were my everything
My little light of sunshine I'm holdin' on for better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

[Verse 3]
What does it mean if I don't know what love feels like
My parents got divorced when I was young so I just feel like
Examples that I have to look upon are probably not great
Knowing you're in a similar position doesn't make it O.K
I'm feeling like my goal is to make these blue skies turn grey
But in the blink of an eye it could go away
So even if it's just for ten minutes I wanna drive around with you
And think about our life in the present these are our better days

[Hook]
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days
I pray for better days
I know what has to happen I'm away
I know in my life I've made mistakes
But I'm holdin' on for better days

388,Anytime (i'll Be There),"Anytime you need me babe
Just call I'll be there
Call and see what a good friend can be
When you need someone to care
Nothing more than understanding
Just a man who's undemanding
Like a leaf that's only landing suddenly
Goes when the wind gently blows

And I'm asking nothing of you love
Only what you want to give
And I wish you what I wish myself
As long as I may live
Other arms will surely hold you
Just remember the things that I told you
When these arms of mine enfold you
It's not out of greed but for love
And for need

I love you so, I still do
I'm sure you know when I'm holding you
The sad part of seeing you is goodbye

Call and I'll come when your world's come undone
I'm like you, I get lonely too
And I need someone to hold
Knowing well this world can be hell
And sometimes very cold

Nothing firm and nothing binding
Now and then a slight reminding
Waking up one day and finding
Somewhere to run, somewhere to run
Somewhere to run when your world's come undone
Oh babe, I'll be there, I'll be there anytime

There's a certain thing about you
Summer, fall and spring about you
I could write and sing about you
And never run out, never run out (no)
Never run out of what you're all about

Lord ya know I'm going to need a friend
Til I get used to losing you
Let me keep on using you
Til I can make it on my own

[Verse 2]
I'll get by
But no matter how I try
There'll be times you know I'll call
Chances are my tears will fall
And I'll have no pride at all
From time to time
But they say
Oh there'll be a brighter day
But til then I'll lean on you
That's all I mean to do
Til I can make it on my own
Surely someday I'll wake up and see the morning sun
Without another lonely night behind me
Then I'll know I'm over you and all my cryings done
No more hurting memories to find me

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance

When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you

Same window but seeing a different view

Take a jacket to hold me; what did I ever do wrong?
I'd better stay home it's not good in my stars today
Can't sleep am I falling apart at the seams?
Really out of my head now; is it me or the room that's spinning?
Only water and bread now they're throwing me out of my home

In my imagination everything's right where it used to be wrong

But it's OK (it's OK!) if you carry a gun
Terrorific news on four from the Lebanon
All those stupid little bastards where in hell did they come from?

397,Fallen Angel,"[Verse 1]
Hi Depression
How yea been??
It's been a long time, we meet again

I've been good
The fuck you been up to though?
Lately you look like your unstoppable
You must just not of check your messages
I've been trying to get to you desperately
It's time you came and pay your debt to me

I just want to be left in peace
Why the fuck you gotta mess with me?
So sick and tired of you testing me
Don't get to smile. Don't get to sleep

Sounds like you just need stress relief
Cut yourself or maybe take some pills
Cause nobody cares if you die or live
A waste of space, another useless soul
The world is better ... if you just go

Why you an asshole?
Making it easy?
As long as I'm breathing, my family needs me!

Give it a week and they'll forget your gone
Forget your name, forget your songs
You think you're loved but that's a lie
I cross my heart and I hope you die
You can't cope with this
You can't cope with change
You got knots to tie
You got ropes to hang

But what do I do when I can't get a job
And I can't get the fuck out my house?
I'm loosing it slowly my life is unfolding
And this isn't what I'm about!

Whoa
Tone it down. You're going to bust a vein
It's just your fate this isn’t just a phase
I'm drawn to you and you belong to me
I hope you see now that you're stuck with me

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

[verse 2]
Get the fuck out of my head!!!

Heha! Hey! Hold up man
I'm not done with you!
I'm going to do what I'm going to do!

Fuck this shit I'm not comfortable!
All I ever do is run from you!
I can't except this, I crave acceptance
I stay expecting the same exact thing
The same rejection, The same deflection
The same infection, My brain's defective!

Don't you want to come and play with me?
We can see the world, at least a darker side of it?
I got in and left a mark inside your head
I'm not leaving until the heart comes out of your chest
Heh, I've seen your soul it isn't worth you keeping it
And your incompleteness is what's been completing me

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head - I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will make you...
Just another fallen angel

[Verse 3]
Get the fuck out of my head!!!

I see dark on the brightest day
I fight the pain, I just want to gain some confidence
Locked in the mother-fucking box on top is a rock
I don't know how I got in this
(I do) Fuck you, fuck everyone else and the whole world!
I've been on the edge and I'm unsure
I have been feeling like something is building inside of me
Killing me slowly, I feel like I'm dying and I've been trying to deal with the stress
Life is a mess! I wish I was blessed! I wish I was...

Dead

Maybe you're right

You know that I'm right

I'm sick of my life

You're sick of your life?
Well come with me now
We could end it tonight
We could end it tonight

[Chorus]
The voice inside your head I am the poison in your veins
I toy with your emotions
I take pleasure with your pain
And I will take you

398,It Should Have Been Me,"I saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned to me and gave me a smile

Then the preacher, then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people, the people began to stand

When I shouted, ""It should have been me
No, it should have been me
You know it should have been me
Baby how can you do this to me?""

""You made a promise that we'd never part
Then you turned around and you broke my, my heart
Now you're standing there saying ""I do""
Holding hands with somebody new""

""When you know that it should have been me
No, it should have been me
Oh, it should have been me
Baby how can you do this to me?""

Then the preacher, whoa yeah
The preacher asked that there be silence please
""If any objections to this wedding
Speak now or forever, forever hold your peace""

And I stood up and said:
""It should have been me
No, it should have been me!""
Jumped out of my seat and screamed ""It should have been me!
Oh, don't blow away my mind
People, believe me, that man is mine
It should have been me
No, you know it should have been me
Oh, it should have been me
Oh, somebody call the police
That woman down there is a doggone thief
It should have been me

You got the magic thrillin' me, you got the magic chillin' me
You got the magic, shine your spell on me

Whoa, when the hoodoo children of night gather near
Ah! when the whirlwind whispers your name, I can hear
Wind in the willows, scratchin' in the sand
And the whole universe is at your command there

400,This Is It,"[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]
All you fools just sound the same
Ain’t no credit to your name
Ain’t no credit line open, that’s discrediting the fame
Form your business in the name, something unique like a slang
Make a difference, make a change
But ain’t no puppets on a string
Don’t be chilling on the couch, remember this is for the clout
Remember this is for the poor niggas that’ll represent you when you’re out
Forget you when you need your friends, fuck it we just meet again (why)
All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
Always was a winner even when I wasn’t 'posed to
The money getting bigger as if it wasn’t supposed to
Just a lonely nigga, talk too much to myself, need a break
On July 8th broke down heaven’s gates
Now I stay high all day
Fuck you leaving, fuck all evening
Call me mister fuck all day
Trap all day and night
Don’t need a house much less you ‘bout some change
Expand my conscious, tryna’ walk on water
Feel the earth on me
You hatin’, I’ll be somewhere slayin’ bitches by their face on me
Catch a fade, Kobe, with an eighth on me
Not phased, don’t pass that shit homie
Cough, smoke, cough, got my shit sealed off
‘Bout to put some in the air, ‘til a nigga doze off
Cos you got some shrooms, I got a room
You and me ‘til we reach the moon
Never wore a disguise, love the skin I’m in
You trade your soul for fame, we ain’t built the same

[Hook: Erick Arc Elliott]

All my niggas need a plan, cos all my niggas need to win

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
All I ever wanted was to be a one to one
Now I’m one in three
Compulsively a nigga gotta run up or get none
Know I feel your pain, a different day
Opinions always alter when you’re done
Pray to put you down, afraid to look around, instead I pen it for my dogs (Hoo!)
Know my city give me 150 for my steez, 150 for my beats
Three niggas, we gotta eat
Shouts to fans that’s overseas, hey
Independent grind, at least we did form a company
We a bond that never breaks, never giving up the cake
Not a fan of pointing fingers at men
It’s dependent on who can pay for academics
Homie your chemists are missing appendages
You back into handling business, no kidding
My head’s at the clinic, I need a prescription
My vision is clearer through smoke and them mirrors
I can’t be compared to those niggas you hearing
So don’t be offended when niggas don’t feel you

Feeling brave? Nigga run up
Buck shots, tear your muscle
And I don’t need Joey to pump it
Pitbull, no muzzle
Badmon, I’m thuggin’
Done know, gun smoke
Can’t tell me nothin’, there’s no need for discussion
I’m the sinner in Saint, I'm the box logo bully
Used to buy Bathing Ape, now they send this shit to me
I paved the way for niggas that're scared to say what they ain't wanna say
Now watch a demon demonstrate, annihilate
Love / hate it's all the same
Will I die from my homicide
Or will I die from taking too much drugs?
Lord knows I deserve to die on an acid high and I’m double cupped
Coke line, hundred blunts
Seen a few bitches I’d love to fuck
2Pac in 96 and troublesome
27 club, here I come
Comma, c-c-c-c comma, comma, comma
A whole lot of decimals
I just s-see my account and c-c-c-c-c-c-c count all my blessings up
Bloodstream full of chemical
Crip, Blood, twist your fingers up
Better than some of them veterans
Bet they gon’ say it’s beginners luck
I would die for my niggas, but would they do the same?
Hennessey by the gallon, I'm losing my balance and manage the pain
I would ride for my niggas, just show me the lane
My grandaddy's still in the kitchen, w-w-whipping the ‘caine
My celly’ keep ringing
I cannot find enough coverage to answer
The backwoods is hitting
Hope that that shit is not giving me cancer
Trip on acid while I'm rapping, Sippin' muddy, counting money
I think she took too many xannies, she fell asleep while she was sucking

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
Made it out the gutter, shout out to my mother
Kudos to my papa, he ain’t wear the rubber
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers
This is it, I do this shit here for my brothers...

Of a love forever more

I've got this burning, burning, yearning
Feelin' inside me

You were a perfect guy

408,Take It To The Limit,"[Verse 1]
All alone at the end of the evening and the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinking about a woman who might have loved me and I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer spent my life running round
And it's so hard to change can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep on turning out and burning out and turning out the same

[Chorus]
So put me on a highway and show me a sign and take it to the limit one more time

[Verse 2]
You can spend all your time making money you can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
And when you're looking for more freedom when nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door well you can't find it anywhere
When there's nothing to believe in
Still you're coming back you're running back
You're coming back for more

Fly me high through the starry skies
Or maybe to an astral plane
Cross the highways of fantasy
Help me to forget today's pain

Ain't no laughter, only alone
With the mem'ries of love you have known

Sunshine shinin' only for one
Just brings darkness after it's done
You stay cold when you're on the run
A painful price to pay

You die inside a little
Each time that you open your eyes
You try to hide
But you must face the truth
When love has gone away

Raining morning long overdue
Time I used to spend holdin' you
I don't think you were just passing through
It just turned out that way

You die inside a little
Each time that you open your eyes
You try to hide
But you must face the truth
When love has gone away

(Away, away, away, away)
There's nothing that you can lose
(Oh, no)

Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound

Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (igh!)

Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?

417,Forever Lovers,"Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

They checked into a small hotel
She blushed when he asked
For the bridal suite

Was the beginning of their lives together
Anxiously they'd waited for the moment
That their love would be complete

She reached inside
Her brand new traveling bag
And found her brand new negligee
And then she shyly slipped it on

And suddenly, he realized
The beauty of the tender prize
He'd waited for so long and finally won

She climbed into the bed
He snapped his fingers
Said, I've got to get champagne

There's a little store right down the block
I'll only be a minute, close your eyes
And, hon, I'll be right back again

And time goes by so slowly
She's not sure how much has passed
When she hears the siren
Screaming through the night

And seven hours later, they find her
Rocking on the bed
Just singing in the early morning light

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
When love never ends

She checks into the old hotel
And pays a little extra for the suite

She slips into the faded negligee
And brushes down her hair of gray
And lays her body down to wait

And the night air through the curtains
Makes a sound like someone breathing
And she reaches for him with her fingertips

And they find her in the morning
With tear stains on her pillow
And a smile like a kiss upon her lips

Forever lovers, forever friends
A lifetime's a short time
I knew I'd see you again

When love never ends",Mac Davis,1976,"[76, 79, 81, 84, 88]",5

Oh well I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary
She took the pains of boyhood, and turned them into feel-good
Oh how I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

Mary was the girl who taught me all I had to know
She put me right on my first mistake
Summer wasn’t gone when I learned all she had to show
She really gave all a boy could take

So now when I get lonely, still looking for the one and only
That’s when I wish I was lying in the arms of Mary

420,Moonlight Serenade,"Understand the Night
When she flashes her sparkling eyes at dusk
She flirts with Twilight
When the noise of day dies away
The Night and Twilight stay and stay
Making quiet love up high over the town
And the gentle Twilight gives his light
Making a queen of Night

If I could, I would write a sonnet of the night as a
Rememberance of your eyes

And, if you'd promise not to tell
I could whisper the words in the dark, like a lover
We could count the stars - the shooting stars -
And talk of lovers through the ages who had lived out
Of their dreams
Such will and spirit, courage they needed to live in a dream;
To burn, with every breath so serene -
As if they had been the first to find love at all -
Like Night and Twilight
(They were the first of lovers ever.)
Could we be like them - hold on to one another until
Dawn comes?
Then, we'll fly off and dream until Night and Twilight
Kiss again

My love - my one and only love -
Let me take you out under the moonlight and show how
The Twilight loves the Night;
Why he lives for an hour of loving through lifetimes of
Longing

And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no

And starin' at a wall

426,I Thought It Took A Little Time (But Today I Fell In Love),"[Bridge 1]
Am I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me
My friends all fall so easily

[Verse 1]
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so?
'Cause the feeling was so unexpected
I could hardly keep myself collected

I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin'
Never did believe in lovin' on sight
I thought it took time to learn about lovin'
All I know is now it's gotta be right

In the midst of conversation he looked into my eyes
And all through the conversation much to my own surprise
Half the words he said to me were missin'
'Cause my mind was so intend on kissin'

[Hook]

But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so?

Words without love are just words with no meaning

I can\'t hide with only words
Lose you, now the last thing I want is to lose you
But it seems like I\'m losin\' myself
I feel like someone else and not myself

When something\'s died

Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")

Pretending, not part of
At heart of

I feel like someone else
I\'m not myself


Baby, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")
When I\'m by your side

Easy, to pretend nothing\'s wrong
Would be easy
But to face it when something is wrong
It\'s the hardest thing I\'ve done
Stronger, I was weak but I\'m growing much stronger
If you give me a little more time
The more I find myself the more I found

Oooh, ooh, oh, words are impossible
When something\'s died
It\'s not the fame
Give me more (or \""that mean more\"")
When I\'m by your side

Words without love have no meaning
I keep pretending
It gets harder
Sooooo, harder
Help me make it

I\'ll get stronger
I\'ll get stronger :)",Margie Joseph,1976,"[87, 87, 89, 92, 92, 93]",6

Watching a new love grow
From old love's embers
Yesterday's gone but today remembers
Doesn't it seem to come down the same for everyone

Only love is real
Everything else illusion
Adding to the confusion of the way we connive
At being alive
Tracing a line till we can define
The thing that allows us to feel
Only love is real
Childhood dreams like muddy waters
Flowing through me to my son and daughters
Everything I ever thought is confirmed as truth to me
Even as I see the way that I want to go now
Still I had wished I had known what I know now
Maybe I could have spared you
Giving your youth to me

440,We Can't Hide It Anymore,"Yesterday when he came here
Willie's eyes swept the floor
And he looked so brought down
And he asked if I'd seen you around
I said no and I showed him to the door
But he knows the score, he knows it

Chorus:
And we can't hide it anymore
We can't hide it anymore
We can't hide
We can't hide it anymore
We can't hide, no, no, no, no, no

And in the morning you're beside me
And we smile as lovers do
But his whole world is breaking up
And all your time I'm taking up
And I've been spending every night with you
And he knows it too, he knows it

Repeat Chorus

Last night you called me on the telephone
Said you felt like you were being torn apart
I know it's not easy, babe
But we knew that from the start
Now we're in love and it's bound to break his heart
Bound to break his heart

So what do we tell him
What do we say
Now you're the one he loves and trusts
And you've turned his dreams right into dust
Like the wind we've blown them all away
And he knows today, he knows it

Repeat Chorus and fade",Larry Santos,1976,"[47, 36, 38, 42, 46, 52, 63, 73, 81, 83]",10

Measuring a summer's day

The hours they bring me pain

[Chorus]
Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

444,Junk Food Junkie,"You know I love that organic cooking
I always ask for more
And they call me Mr. Natural
On down to the health food store

I only eat good sea salt
White sugar dont touch my lips
And my friends is always
Begging me to take them
On macrobiotic trips
Yes, they are

Oh, but at night I take out my strongbox
That I keep under lock and key
And I take it off to my closet
Where nobody else can see

I open that door so slowly
Take a peek up north and south
Then I pull out a Hostess Twinkie
And I pop it in my mouth

Yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

Well, at lunchtime
You can always find me
At the Whole Earth Vitamin Bar
Just sucking on my plain white yogurt
From my hand thrown pottery jar

And sippin' a little hand pressed cider
With a carrot stick for dessert
And wiping my face in a natural way
On the sleeve of my peasant shirt
Oh, yeah

Ah, but when that clock strikes midnight
And I'm all by myself
I work that combination
On my secret hideaway shelf

And I pull out some Fritos corn chips
Dr. Pepper and an Ole Moon Pie
Then I sit back in glorious expectation
Of a genuine junk food high

Oh yeah, in the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me

My friends down at the commune
They think I'm pretty neat
Oh, I don't know nothing about arts and crafts
But I give 'em all something to eat

I'm a friend to old Euell Gibbons
And I only eat homegrown spice
I got a John Keats autographed Grecian urn
Filled up with my brown rice
Yes, I do

Oh, but folks lately I have been spotted
With a Big Mac on my breath
Stumbling into a Colonel Sanders
With a face as white as death

I'm afraid someday they'll find me
Just stretched out on my bed
With a handful of Pringles Potato Chips
And a Ding Dong by my head

In the daytime I'm Mr. Natural
Just as healthy as I can be
But at night I'm a junk food junkie
Good Lord have pity on me",Larry Groce,1976,"[65, 47, 24, 20, 9, 10, 13, 17, 23, 29, 34, 41, 46, 56, 68]",15

A true you just a struggle with your heavy load
I know it seems you lose the battle more and more
Life is not an easy road
You have to play your part and take control
Don't you ever ease up, never give up, don't let go
Hopeless youths them out inna the street
And them no have no job, so just to win they have to cheat
Tell me why so many see it and don't speak
And why they'll never find a peaceful home they can retreat
And them can find no food to eat
And where you lay your head them have a bed of concrete
And your momma she ah cry when she ah see it
It's not a revolution just a cycle that repeats 'cause

A true you just a struggle with your heavy load
I know it seems you lose the battle more and more
Life is not an easy road
You have to play your part and take control
Don't you ever ease up, never give up, don't let go
See the sunshine will come one day
And prejudice and inequality will fade away
Man will not judge man but he will say
It's time to love my neighbor as my brother and not hate
And the world will unite as one
And governments eliminate all chemicals and bombs
We will no longer have to run
The uprising has only just begun, so hear me song

Oughta be scribbled all over them billboards
In big old black and bloody letters, ten feet tall

447,Spirit In The Night,"[Verse 1]
Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
'long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Well Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody wanna go on up to Greasy Lake
It's about a mile down on the dark side of route eighty-eight
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light

[Chorus]
And they dance like spirits in the night (All night) in the night (All night)
Oh, you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you

[Verse 2]
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, ""Try some of this it'll show you where you're at, or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt,"" she said, ""Honey, let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can

[Chorus]
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (All night)
In the night (All night), Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (All night), in the night (All night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy
Dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right

[Chorus]
Together we moved like spirits in the night, all night
Baby don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
Stand right up and let it shoot right through you",Bruce Springsteen,1976,"[97, 98, 100]",3

449,Mozambique,"[Verse 1]
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 2]
There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 3]
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

[Verse 4]
And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

[Instrument break]",Bob Dylan,1976,"[54, 55, 55, 60, 74]",5
450,Fanny (Be Tender With My Love),"First I rise, then I fall
Seems like you don't want the love
Of this man at all
And it's sure been a lonely time
Right up to the time I met you
So if you take a love like mine

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

So you say to yourself, boy
You're out of your brain
Do you think I'm gonna stand here
All night in the rain?
And it's the start of a love affair
The moment when I first met you
And if you want I'll take you there

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

With my love
Our love will seal it together
Oh, with our love
You made a promise
You'll always love me forever

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't forsake me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to break it
Fanny, be tender with my love
'Cause it's all that I've got
And my love won't desert me

Be tender with my love
You know how easy it is to hurt me
Fanny, be tender with my love",Bee Gees,1976,"[57, 23, 12, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 32, 40, 52, 63]",15

Ah, ah, when I was younger
I, I should've known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back
(Ah, ah!)
Got a new girlfriend
He feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blindness

[Chorus]
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

[Verse 2]
I, I got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move (Whoo!)
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I love you
That's all she wrote

[Chorus]
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love
Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, like a drug
Oh, Ophelia

452,"Here, There And Everywhere","[Verse]
To lead a better life, I need a love of my own
Here
Making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to meet her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be here, there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere",Paul McCartney,1976,"[65, 68, 74, 85, 95]",5

Lil Sally Walker, uh, shake it proper, uh
Bend it over, make it wobble, uh, got a lotta buns
Pick it up and drop it, uh, for the proper funds
Anything to make the profit come, get them dollars, hon'
Add that shit up just like mathematics
If you do it for free, then it's ass backwards
All of you bitches is mad at me
Pro'ly mad 'cause you ain't in my tax bracket
You bitches is broker than glass crackin'
You ain't gon' do shit, you just act ratchet
Play with me, you gon' get backhanded
I toot it up and look back at it

[Verse 2]
Watch me throw it back and toot it, they love how I do it, uh
I'm the truth, you can't refuse it, plus my body's stupid, uh
He wasn't even shot by Cupid, but your dude's a groupie, uh
You would think it's gettin' evicted how my booty movin' (yeah)
Better yet, I need a U-Haul
One of a kind, I don't do malls
These bitches talk more than group calls
Shut the fuck up with them loose walls
Matter fact, I'm not gon' go back and forth
With you bitches like Duval and Snoop Dogg
These bitches front like a new bra
Don't get your ass dragged like RuPaul

She didn't know what to do, so she jumped in front of me

456,50 Ways To Leave Your Lover,"(Sha-Smoove)
I told her hop on the bus Gus
From the first time i met you should've know you were no one i could trust
But i took my chances just so i could test my waters
That wasn't smart figured you hold my heart
Take it with you on Noah's ark
But nah no part of me was even on that boat
You just told me what i wanted to hear like a horoscope
Father broke, blew his cash on liquor made from artichokes
Surprised her background cleaner then a bar of soap
You convinced me to do certain things that i wouldn't do
Felt guilty so convinced myself just to do it for you
But i shouldn't let my past interfere with the future
Turned my heart into stone staring at Medusa
Hit your fanny from the got her telling me go deeper
She only said that she was influenced by the reefer
We could hit the shopping mall just to show niggas we was styling
Then we hit the Jamaican islands

(hook)

(Richie Biness)
Imma' slip out the back jack like an ass crack
I'm mad that her love was so hazmat
Poison avoiding the problems
Toying its obvious
She only wanted me for the objects
Honest, i really thought i liked you
Thought i was going to wife you
Felt bad parents were junkies dropped out of high school
Tried to assist with the green like Rondo
But i know i was getting played like a high note
Started getting bold with some back talk
You wasn't from the streets but i guess its that ass fault
I was blinded , mindless i thought we were timeless
Yea looks could kill but so did my kindness
Killed our relationship
We started faking shit
She said to me i don't think we can make it rich
Thought to myself and i sadly agreed
And I'll never forget what she said to me
She said

(hook)

(Sha-Smoove)
There's more than 50 ways you could leave the one that you truly love
And i always tried to better you
I put you on that pedestal
I always was so loyal
No one else was ever before you
Neither above never gave up on us
Took my heart and crushed it
You couldn't be trusted

Verse 1: Mori Briscoe
She gonna fuck cuz my bands up
Glock behind the ferragamo I can barely hold my pants up
Bullets burn him like a tanner
Crack a chevy and its litt now I got a santander
Gang in the back I know they lurking
Milo pull up put that work in (Boom Boom)
I call up Nick and he done 'em
Runnin' through packs and them racks now we dumpin'
I swear this blicky won't jam
Could never switch up on my mans (How the fuck you switch up)
I could never ever switch
I could never snitch
Never turn a bitch
Know I'm fuckin' up a 6
D'd up are you dumb?
Pieces always litt (Racks)
Know I'm owner of the bit
Countin' up the checks while I fuck your bitch (Racks Racks)
Blick make 'em holler no hitman
Tried to run down how ya blick jam?
Keep a blicky on me that's for casualties
Imma blam with my mans that got accuracy
30 shots what I hold in the magazine Gang (Bltt Bow)
30 Shots what I hold in the magazine (Gltt)

Verse 2: TrapGod Glizzoe
They not on my level now
They say that they lurking so I tote the metal now
Babas say hello now
Stackin' my bread tryna get out the ghetto now
And I stay with a full clip
When I put it to your ear you gonna think its a Q-tip
Get swept with a broomstick
Blick in his teeth I think its a toothpick
Tryna get to that bag
Dip from the jakes then skirt in a jag
The opps really doing bad
Spicin' and Twirlin' she call me her dad
I live my life like a movie
Opps in the field and they keep tryna shoot me (But they miss)
You can get smoked like a loosie
She want me to kill but she got the cooties (Eww)
I'm from New York where they throwing up rakes or they throwing up woo
And everyone knows you can't be both so you better choose
And I cannot go I keep a pole stay with like 2 (like what)
Run up and I shoot (like what)
Boy you could get boomed (Boom Boom Boom)

Verse 3: Milo Floxks
Niggas talk this and that
But I talk facts like the back of a snapple cap (Boom Boom Boom)
Flatbush where I'm at you pull up get clapped got chops we gon deal with that
If you flockin' I'm shootin' back
And if it's BOA then my niggas from Iraq
No time for an opposition
My niggas on a mission on a road to that fuckin' chicken
My niggas be geekin' and drippin'
Figi shots what my niggas be sendin'
Adidas for the go niggas know I never told my niggas ain't takin no losses
See a opp he get blown out proportion
Free all my blixkys the extortionists
And y'all dumb lil niggas gon' forfeit
Cuz this year y'all be takin' these losses
Your treesh in the spot and she givin' us top
Said y'all niggas be holdin' these chops (Thottiee)
How you claim that you flock? But you never flock?
You just be holding the chop
Free Bito and Bam TG
We spinnin' y'all block in McQueen's
I ain't really with the Facebook

Ho bevuto troppo, meglio se
Mi riportano da te
Ti ho colpita, sono Cupido
Una tipa chic come te
Vuole un trap boy come me
E io l'ho capito subito

[Strofa 1: Sfera Ebbasta]
Ami se rispondo male, se non mi faccio trovare
A cena in quel ristorante che adori
Però poi mi faccio aspettare
Foto con altre, ma è tutto normale
Fai la gelosa, non rispondi al cellulare, huh
E vieni qua, mentre fumo un blunt
Ti verso la Sprite sul baby doll
Siamo rock 'n' roll
Al mio collo flash, flash
Foto, wow, ti compro una borsa di Dior
Ti penso, my love, yah
Anche se la sera, quando si fa tardi
Sono in giro con gli altri e siamo tutti bastardi
Siamo tutti annebbiati dal fumo e dal Bacardi
Forse questa volta meglio non incontrarsi

I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Call my phone, yeah
Baby, call my phone, oh right
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone

[Verse 1]
Lost without my other half
How can I live without ya?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe? (Breathe)
And everything is off, where are you?
Guess it's all my fault, lady sings the blues
No one could deny it, we were flying like United
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
(Bop bop bop bop bop)

[Verse 2]
Got photos of us on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone (Hey)
Boy, I just can't erase 'em
The first text I ever got from ya still saved in my inbox
And I read it back time after time
Boy, I'm lost, can't you look?
Won't you please find me?
I'm down to my last tear, come rescue me
See, it's broken my heart to the point where I don't leave the house, no reason out, weekends out just ain't the same without you
But I thought we were inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up (No)
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever (Oh babe)
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)
One of us just gotta pick the phone now

[Bridge]
It's been sixteen days since I held you tight
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night
Boy, I just wish you'd show up and make everything alright
So what you waitin' for?
'Cause both us have thought that we're inseparable

[Chorus]
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong (Inseparable)
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up

Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable (Except for us)

""—perfectly fine, that's fine!""

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

[Bridge: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jaden]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions

Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day

462,Slow Ride,"[Produced by Rick Rubin and Beastie Boys]

They got a committee to get me off the block
Cause I say my rhymes loud and I say 'em nonstop
Because being bad news is what we're all about
We went to White Castle and we got thrown out

I got my boy Mike D. - I got the King Adrock
I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler, grabbed a cool Bud

Slow riding, gun hidin', on the go
I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom, coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack

She chased me out of class, she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom, rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand, at the microphone stand
Ay, yo, homeboy - what you drinkin', man?

I got money - I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms - I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the def behinds
I got ill - I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold - I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey

Because I'm hard hittin' - always bitten - cool as hell
I got trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house - gettin' high and watchin' tube
Eating Colonel's chicken - drinkin' Heineken brew
I'm a gangster, I'm a prankster - I'm the king of the ave
I'm hated, confrontated for the juice that I have
All the fine ladies are making a fuss
But I can't pay attention - cause I'm on that dust",Beastie Boys,1976,"[71, 31, 20, 20, 22, 24, 27, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 40, 50]",14

465,The White Knight,"Down 75 or 85
Or I-20 t'other way
Turn your squelch to the right
And in the night
You'll hear some good buddy say
""Breaker breaker
Got a picture taker
All Smokeys at forty three.""

It's that Japanese toy
The trucker's joy
That everybody calls CB
Yeah, Citizen's Band, keeps you up to date
On fender benders and Tijuana taxis
And all them bears out there. Flip flop

Now ahead of your children and ahead of your wife
On the list of the ten best things in life
Your CB's gotta rate right around number four
'Course beavers and hot biscuits and Merle Haggard
Come one, two, three, you know

Well I was loaded down, coming outta Lake City;
I was checkin' out seat covers, young and pretty
When all of a sudden there come a call
Over my CB, ringin' wall to wall
Said clove her double nickels till you hit the ridge
'Cause there's a Smokey picture taker t'other side of the bridge

""Oh mercy, 'ppreciate that, good buddy;
What's your handle there, come on?
You got any county mounties out there prowlin', come on?""
And he said --

""Ten four...back door
Put the peddle to the metal and...let it roar
Hammer down...to Macon town...
Gonna see my momma...sure
Well, the bears are gone
Let's...bring it on...
The Georgia line's...out of sight
Pulled outta Richmond town last Saturday night
And my handle is...the White Knight
How 'bout it?""

""All right, White Knight, hammer down
You got the mean machine here.""
I was a streakin'
My needle was a peakin'
A right around seventy nine
That old diesel juice
Was a gettin' loose
And everything was fine
But wall to wall
I got a call
Front door, big bear trapper
Said, ""Break one nine
Good buddy of mine
You got a Smokey in a plain white wrapper.""

Well I jammed my stick
I lost twenty quick;
You could hear them gears a tearin'
I got passed by a beaver
And a Camaro
I was cruisin' alone
And going so slow
I could count every button on that frilly blouse she was wearin'

'Course there weren't but one

""Hey there, super trooper!
Yeah -- that's the crafty Smokey over there with a CB of his own
Hey White Knight, let's slide one on the super trooper, come on?""

""Ten four, back door
Put the peddle to the metal, whatcha...waitin' for?
That old flop
Can't stay in sight
Gonna leave you here and say no more
How 'bout it?""

""Whoa, now, buddy, that's fightin' talk
I'd get up there and blow your doors off!""

Well I hammered down like I had wings
Little gravels in my wheels going ping, ping, ping
'Bout the time I hit ninety-two
Saw something flashing' in my rear view
Thought to myself that can't be true
But there it was, old blue, blue, blue

Uh oh. Bubble gum machine done hit the jackpot

Well I could see that bear, laughing big
Hangin' in tight on the back of my rig
Right there and then it came to be wall to wall
Mm-hmm

So in that cold dark Georgia night
In the shadows of Smokey bear's blue light
I 'cided to make me just one more CB call

""Breaker one nine for the super trooper
Hey there, Smokey old buddy, tell me if I'm right
Are you my front door? Are you the White Knight? Come on?""
And he said --

""Ten four, back door
You're in a heap of trouble boy...that's for sure
Gonna read you your rights, and treat you fair
Pull over there
With your...rockin' chair
Want you boys to know each other real well
'Cause you gonna be sharin' the same jail cell
You make twelve cotton pickers I've caught tonight
From the front door of that White Knight
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
How 'bout it?
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
Forty miles over the speed limit!
You boys gonna be here a spell
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!
Hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha-hhha!!""

That's it, cotton pickers, I've done been grounded;
My tail's in jail, my rig impounded
So when you're comin' through the Georgia night
Don't ever get no front door called the White Knight

All fly girls' nipples and toes numb from it

Get your growth stunted from this, you don't want it

Who the ultimate? Yo my man speak upon it
Ayo, I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
Rock mics so nice, I make you stock price plummet
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane, barking big game and get hunted
Eye witness account, say it happened so sudden
Just slid off to the side, didn't really say nuttin
Then BLAOW, blew away the 1900th

Even with stakes inclined, I get mine regardless
Yo, a lot of Smurfette MCs carry purses
And rock uniforms that's made for nurses

Only touching surface, the fuck's the purpose?

From the muscle kid I'm one of the illest of all time
I swing from chandeliers and wall climb
And specialize in warfares of all kind

But half the time, they running down one of mine

Melt down all of your artificial lies

Shared the peak position of #14 on the Billboard chart

I threw the last punch too hard
After years of goin' steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancin' out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been fou-nd
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

Chorus:
And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed, can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet, honey, in the gun
In the gun of Robert Ford
Like a child when his toys have been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded

Обсуждают в интернете так, как я и говорил
Они любят эту моду, эту моду я убил

Каждая таблетка приближает мой конец
Запиши про Гошу трек, но это уже не тренд
Я убийца моды, но ношу самый модный бренд

You wake up and time has slipped away
And suddenly it's hard to find

The laughter and the tears
The shadows of misty yesteryears
The good times and the bad you've seen
And all the others in between
Remember
Do you remember the times of your life (do you remember)

Reach back for the joy and the sorrow
Put them away in your mind
For memories are time that you borrow
To spend when you get to tomorrow

Here comes the setting sun
The seasons are passing one by one
So gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today
Remember
Will you remember the times of your life

Gather moments while you may
Collect the dreams you dream today

up to the tollbooth. He grabs a bill from his pocket and hands it
to the toll-collector. The car in front of Sonny's seems to be
having a problem moving and Sonny sounds his horn.]

SONNY: Son-of-a-bitch! Come on! Come on! *The toll-collector ""drops"" Sonny's change, and bends to pick it up, sliding the booth's door shut. Sonny turns his head and notices a line of armed men pointing their weapons at him. A fusillade of shots pelt the car, and Sonny, as he stumbles out screaming. Once fallen and dead, a hitman comes up and shoots him from very close range, stops, then kicks him in the head. The assassins flee before the Corleone car shows up.*

VITO CORLEONE: But you needed a drink first.

TOM *shaking his head, then says quietly*: Yup...

VITO CORLEONE: Well, now you've had your drink.

TOM *his voice breaking*: They shot Sonny on the Causeway. He's dead.

VITO CORLEONE *exhales, bows his head; physically shaken and weakened*: I want no inquiries made. I want no acts of vengeance. I want you to arrange a meeting, with the heads of the Five Families. This war stops now. *The Don, weakly standing, goes to embrace Tom. Then he begins to exit.*

VITO CORLEONE: Call Bonasera. We need him now.

485,Uptown & Country,"[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day which could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 2]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

486,Train Called Freedom,"Undress the hate
Your tired hands
Begin to shake
Your so worn out
War torn indifferent
You lie among the cobwebs in your hiding place
You take another pill and float away, yeah

And you, you were born to the rule the world
And you could have changed the future
But you didn't realize what it took to pay the price
You were born to rule the world
But you couldn't tell the future
Can you look into the eyes
Of the innocent who've died
You were born to rule the world- yes you
You were born to rule the world

We call your name
The same name that's always been
From the dawn of time
We need your help
To save us from ourselves
We turn to the guilty and religious right
We try to understand the reasons why? why?

That you-
You you were born to rule the world
And you came to change the future
We could not realize
Why you gladly paid the price
You were born to rule the world
And you died to make us listen
A Human sacrifice
Can we look into your eyes

You were born to rule the world
You were born to rule the world
You were born to rule the world

(musical bridge)
And you, you were born to the world
And you came to change the future
And you didn't criticize
You just laid it on the line
You were born to rule the world
The magic and the lesson
A Human sacrifice
Can we look into your eyes
Can we look into your eyes
Will we look into your eyes
Will we look into your eyes?

(outro voice)

Sure enough cooking is our own fate
And not everyone thinks about the human race
Even when were all swimming in the same big lake
You know everyone listens but they never change
Too many people want to just kill the pain
But all of us need to hear that voice again
Yeshua

Oh my god, there's something changing
That we didn't know

'firing line'
Guilty as charged
Take another life
No one here but me to blame
Take another life
Guilty as charged

They saw us coming
From miles away
Jubilant train
Wearing a pink boa and feathers like an exotic bird
Double headed
Breathing smoke
Looking for a line to quote
Waiting to jump the rope
To change the vote
To witness hope
In the newest thing
Called freedom
But they said 'no way'
And they wore the same coats
Khaki brown and faded
Typed at the same machines
And tried to box up all the dreams
In neat little packages
Like widgets for the factory
All the while watching big brother watching
Big brother watching
Big brother watching.....
'but we are crashing gates
And we are passing over the gate keepers\""
We are the new
And we are marching like a jubilant train
Through your towns
Past your landscapes of lame ducks
Past the lines of indifference
Past the stormtroopers of compromise
The deputies of damage control
The officers of fear
As they hand out their tickets to the deaf and the dumb and the younger ones
To the very old, the influential, the disturbed, the zealots, the sheltered, the innocent
We pass through the gates
Like the dawning of a new age
Like the turning of a new page
Like the birth of a new son
Like freedom
On a roll
Wearing nothing but a smile on our faces
And our hands up in the air

Which then grew into a hope
Which then turned into a quiet thought
Which then turned into a quiet word
And then that word grew louder and louder
'Til it was a battle cry

[Chorus]
I'll come back when you call me
No need to say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Just because everything's changing
Doesn't mean it's never been this way before
All you can do is try to know who your friends are
As you head off to the war
Pick a star on the dark horizon and follow the light

[Chorus]
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye
You'll come back when it's over
No need to say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Now we're back to the beginning
It's just a feeling and no one knows yet
But just because they can't feel it too
Doesn't mean that you have to forget
Let your memories grow stronger and stronger
'Til they're before your eyes

491,The Homecoming,"[Verse 1]
We are a living absolute
Stuck in an anguished innocence
This moment loved
I greet the sun
And wake from a war i could have won
Well in your arms I'll keep this memory to me
This kitchen floor won't reveal all the things I felt for you

[Chorus]
Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Just don't kill the messenger

[Verse 2]
The dust a-dance against my breath
The world awaken slowly dressed
A life unanswered in the light
With questions scattered in the night
And now my heart feels heavy
The weight will drag me down
You were the only reason
They'd find me here tonight

[Chorus]
Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Just don't kill the messenger


Please level with me
Understand, I'd do anything for you
Seize any moment while you can
This void's coming after you
Cause loneliness is why you hurt
Loneliness is why you hurt

Can't shake what's been on my mind

And now that we are here together
We know it must be fate
So come on, darling
Our romance just can't wait

I can't believe it's true
Girl, there's just no living
Without you

Don't take your love away from me
Don't you leave my heart in misery
Cause if you go then I'll be blue
Breaking up is hard to do

Remember when you held me tight
And you kissed me all through the night
Think of all that we've been through
And breaking up is hard to do

[Chorus]
They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know, I know that it's true
Don't say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up, I wish that we were making up again

I beg of you, don't say goodbye
Can't we give our love just one more try

And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I'm masquerading

One good look at my face

502,Break Away,"[Verse 1: Nines]
Sorry mom for all them times I got suspended in school
Gettin' footballer money, my teacher said I was a fool
Haters commenting on my 'Gram, that shit don't faze me
4 pipes on the Porsche, yo my whip so crazy
Told Pebz ""make sure you stay strapped""
I just left the label Christmas party to go and break down a pack
1a the hood, land all them shottas out of town
Went 'Dam for the plug, now we the opposite of down
Tryna leave a nigga's head by the pavement
Drivin' round in this dinger, gettin' impatient
Thinkin' that I shoulda spent more time with my nephew
It's fucked, seen them fake niggas shine seen the best lose
Pissed cuh my little nigga lost a few guns
Me and Pebz out in bail rollin' with some new ones
I get money every time my phone rings
Wasn't always fly, we had to grow wings
I'm still in the field where it's fucking real
I ain't got time to chill
I need a hundred mil
And way before the deal I paid my mother's bills
Tryna cop a house in the hills
That's how uncle Phil
Free my nigga Hydro, he just rang
When I sweep my floor
I'm finding bitches' earrings in my dust pan
Told my Misses that she can't fucking be my wife
Cuh I'm way too ambitious, you do nothin' with your life
Came a long way from 7 grams on the scale
Feels like yesterday I was banged up in jail
Now it's planes all the time, I be traveling the world
Fuck 'Dam, I'm goin' Spain they got ammi there for sale
But now I'm in the office, used to doin' business in the rain
Now it's house parties every week, Sydney and Sharane
Should I fall back off the trap
Put my whole into rap
Niggas keep callin' for packs
And I can't walk away from stacks
Heard he put down his gun and his mask
Tryna live off his rep, who gives a fuck what you done in the past
Got a deal, still tryna make it off the loud
Don't be standin' with them paigons, cuh I spray in the crowd
It's Nines...

[Skit 1: Nines]
These young bucks are fucked B
Like they look up to the drug dealers and shit
All the gang bangers, or footballers
All the footballers can't make it bruh
And they end up flyin' birds
All the Trapstars can't make you think every little nigga gonna be Nina wid da Nina

[Verse 2: Nines]
Ay yo fuck the haters
Talkin' 'bout we're troublemakers
Everybody on me for a hundred favors
Me and Bund bunin' flavours
Ask the neighbours
I was out there, mornin' from the night
Used to say one day I'll be a baller, I was right
All these groupie bitches around the country wanna holla
Yea I fucked the fans, but don't judge me like your honour
Famous in the shooter
I just came from the jeweler
Immigration wanna dip my chain back to Cuba
Did alright last year, probably shoulda saved more
Lookin' through The Sun I see my ting on page 4
I'm gettin' bait, I gotta hide my face
Still got crackheads whistling outside the base
I just stay in my lane, I ain't worried 'bout them broke haters
Probably get about 20 Phillips watch with no papers
Send my yungens shop for a box of latex
He's been gettin' money since So Solid was rockin' Avirexes
It's Nines...

[Skit 2: Nines]
Some of the flyest Trapstars I ever seen in my life
Or most of them, are ridin' bird right now bludLucky I was flyin' birds
But I was sayin' ""Oh lemme try this music ting as well""
Man was payin like...
Obviously I was payin' for all this shit myself
I could honestly say, I don't know how much I faulked into music
Mad Ps probably, I don't know
Little niggas gotta fuckin' invest their P blud
Or try invest into something other than trapping
I mean everyone can't be a rapper blud
Niggas can do many other things
But just invest in suttin' else B

503,Renegade,"[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
""No, he's not around."" Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it—not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
‘Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Nah, nah!—That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Ha-ha!)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
‘Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a—

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat
Feelin' braver, durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as

But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful

Hoy que me falta tu risa
Desde una estrella me cuidas

Quisiera darte un abrazo
Recuperar la confianza
Aunque no nos dio tiempo
Se que tu alma descansa

Vuela lejos vuela libre
Vuela mi palama blanca
Que aunque ya no estes aqui
Yo vivire
Bajo tus alas

Tenia mucho que decirte
Pero tu no me dejaste
Voy a cambiar el dolor
Por el amor
Que me enseñaste

Pude averme equivocado
Pero nunca fue pa' tanto
Esta, fuera de este mundo
Traicionar a quien mas amo

Voy a rezar en tu nombre
Voy a salir a buscarte
Siento que tu alma me escucha
A si que hagamos las paces

Vuela lejos vuela libre
Vuela mi palama blanca
Que aunque ya no estes aqui
Yo vivire
Bajo tus alas

Tenia mucho que decirte
Pero tu no me dejaste
Voy a cambiar el dolor
Por el amor
Que me enseñaste

Voy a cambiar el dolor
Por el amor
Que me enseñaste

Ya agarraste

Have you lost your way
Have you lost everything
You thought you held
Yesterday

You should leave me behind
And devote all your time
To kissing the spoon
That you once fed him from

Do you lose your mind
Somewhere in the night
While searching the asides
And the b-sides

You should leave me behind

[Intro]
Rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
The real is back, the ville is back
Flow bananas, here, peel this back
And what you'll find is, your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolina's finest, you knew that already
In terms of the greatest, I proved that already
And if you would like, I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade, for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts
And then get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Hope he's okay
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well, and that's the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger, singing

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 2]
What's the price for a black man life?
I check the toe tag, not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on, not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window 'cause tonight the city lit up with lights
Cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me 'cause I  love you like my brothers
And your mothers' like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide, it's just physics
Please let's put our egos aside, you my niggas
And should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
Nights fulla Hennessey
When Hov around we switch up to that D'usse
Gotta show respect, one day we tryna stay where you stay
'Cause we from where you from
Not talkin' bout the slums
I'm talkin' 'bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin' by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin' ass rap niggas son
Yeah I said 'son'
This is New York's finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New York's climate
Like show me New York's ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it, you'll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist, control the game whenever he snap
That's every track, nigga

[Chorus]
Don't give 'em too much you (Don't give 'em too much you)
Don't let 'em take control (Don't let 'em take control)
It's one thing you do (It's one thing you do)
Don't let 'em taint your soul (Don't let 'em taint your soul)
If you believe in God (If you believe in God)
One thing's for sure (One thing's for sure)
If you ain't aim too high (If you ain't aim too high)
Then you aim too low (Then you aim too low)

[Verse 3]
I ain't serve no pies, I ain't slang no dope
I don't bring no lies, niggas sang my quotes
I don't play no games, boy I ain't no joke
Like the great Rakim, when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga, you ain't the God
Nah you ain't the God
Nigga, Cole the God (Cole the God, Cole the God)
January 28th

[Outro]
Make a million dollars off a rap tune
Can I make a million dollars off a rap tune?
(Sound of baby laughing)
I'm tryna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I wanna make a million dollars off a rap tune
I'm gonna make a million dollars off a rap tune",J. Cole,1976,"[87, 87, 92, 92, 96, 99]",6
508,'til It's Time To Say Goodbye,"[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

[Verse 1: Apathy]
See me in the microscope, see me in the fish tank
Chicks want to know my real name plus the dick length
Me? I'm a scientist
God to a lab rat
Now I'm just a has-been rapper in the hazmat
Ducking straight shots, sewing up wounds
Filling up tombs
Let the bass boom
Blood everywhere, so chaotic
I'm a bullet with your name on it
Seeking body after body, and the Mayor, Giuliani
Ain't in office anymore but he's still Illuminati
Death to the king, overthrow everything
They'll be searching our apartments in an ATF sting
Get Busy, the scum of the earth
Hold a black magic séance to summon my verse
I'm a walking skeleton, the zombie that will rush the crowd
Devil baby, I was born inside a mushroom cloud

[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

[Verse 2: Ryu]
Suicide Music
Nothing to fucking fool with
Full clip and an Uzi, shooting out of Suzukis
No excuse, we blast now
Splatter your goose down
Clapping like it's the end, I ruin your fucking movie
Asking for passes
Homie, I'm not a cuby here to bang
Blow your brains all over your bitch's boobies
Take me alive? Never, better to die free
I'm writing ""fuck the police"" inside a goodbye letter
Peace, fade to black, call the priest
Tell him to call Heaven and save me a few seats
Sorry it's so last minute, I'm bringing a few peeps
Body the lieutenant and took a shot at the chief
Sheesh, I guess I got a little problem with authority
Tend to get a little bit gruesome and gory
Volume on ten if I got to get it in
Always keep a pistol grip pump sitting on my lap like a yorkie

[Chorus: Apathy & Ryu]
You could take our lives
Fill us up with lies
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
And I don't even cry, middle finger to the sky
'Cause I know where I'm going when I die
Yeah, cause even if I got to live a life of crime
You got it, I'ma get it
Never need a nine-to-five
I'll push it to the limit 'til it's time to say goodbye, that's fine
'Cause I know just where I'm going when I die

509,I Am Somebody,"[Intro]
Come along children
Now we're going to have a little music
Like old times

[Verse 1: Bliss]
Straight out the gate
This is our story we're scripting
Our film, our glorious vision
Our sound, our score that is written
In this sport, this division
My my, how the tournament's risen
Shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
Everybody wants to be the Lord of the Ring wins
We laid dormant and listened
Hit ignition, tore up the system
Elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
Live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
The formula's mixing to fire the
Engine up and bring the force to the pistons
Never say never whenever together we give and go
With the flow flipping like Jordan and Pippen
Slam the points home
Incite a roar to ignite the board
Wipe the floor with the notes that we write
And hold down with a mic to strike a chord
And then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
When we come with the hunger of the wolves
They were warned and the red flag flew
And his crewed cracked through, it's the running of the bulls

Today, we are together
Whenever we come together
The writers write
The cameras roll
Because together we got power
That's just rappin'

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

[Verse 2: Eso]
Sun, rain, snow or hail
We never got lost in the storm
And you best to respect that you
Never really know what you've got till it's gone
And a monster was born
With a want to explore
Life's roughest weather
But we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
(Yeah, yeah)
And as life unravels
My mind's what fights my battles
I rhyme like lightning travels
Think quick, how you like them apples
Cuz I'm ready as I'll ever be, my head is in the
Melody, I'm flying now each
Feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven
Seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
So no fucking around dumb
Cunt, one jump and I'm up in the clouds
Trying to make that moment last
On a beat like Heath in a Joker mask
Which means, don't change that dial
Could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
Shit, we got things to build
If your luck's low just know your wings are real

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this

Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, yo
I'm so ill in my timeless timepiece
I keep a dime piece in arm's reach
Keep it 1000
From the housing projects I found my niche, you better
Find yours, I used to run with a few
Crime lords, Ramadan taught me use the
Mind more, though I'm not religious
Nas y'all, just the realist
My imminent, conspicuous
Synonym, sincere, rhyme and flow
Developed some images up in your
Mind bro, I survived continuing
Criminal enterprises that
Surrounded me, innocent, no
Exaggeration, I don't pimp my
Past, I don't brag, no faking
My apartment had some break-ins
I'm thinking my past is worse than today is
That's when Biz Mark came with the vapours
It was anarchy, live in a heartbeat
Of the city that never sleeps
Niggas will gas you up to handle their beef
Peep game, you're dead if you don't think
Fast enough, we keeping it way
Street

[Chorus: Bliss n Eso]
I said
Ay yo, I'mma
Lay my tracks down, I'm that
Freight train tearing through the
Sky in the clouds, I said
Ay yo, watch this
Hail mary fly, keep on
Runnin' keep on gunnin' with this
Fire in my eyes, and I'm
Sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (yeah, together)
Welcome to the time of my life (raise your fists high)
I'm sky high
I'm sky high, yeah (together)
Welcome to the time of my life

And my god, I feel alright, hey
And my god, I feel alright
And my god, I feel alright, hey

All the channels show the same old war zone
As I walk alone in the city
Makin' me an offer, now don't they look pretty

New cinema
Live action, all the noise of attraction beats up
On the streets, the sellers do mark up
Better than tellin' em off, don't stock up

Shark, they don't bite
All that matters is you're not here tonight
And now that I wonder
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under
Under sea, under me, under you, under we, undivided
Undecided

If I only knew
What I could do
To make you, make you love me
To make you make you love me

If I only knew
What I could do
To make you make you love me
To make you make you love me

Up north where the snow grows colder
I travel onward 'cross the border
Looked up a girl that I once knew frozen
II found that I was chosen
To be the follower of the deity

Make myself scarce while they
Come to plea bargain
For my body and soul
All the flames go around, surround me

I won't go
I need the ozone
I wanna cuddle up behind your backbone
I never stay long where I'm not wanted
I fell haunted

Yo brother
Where ya gonna go
Back to the warzone
To break down the walls

If I only knew
What I could do
To make you, make you love me
To make you make you love me

If I only knew
What I should do
To make you make you love me
To make you make you love me

If I only knew
What I could do
To make you, make you happy
To make you make you happy

If only I knew what i should do, yeah
To make you make you love me

I bared my soul to the golden traces
Went to the forest of the holy places
And now I wonder
Am I gonna dig a hole ten feet under
Under sea, under me, under you, under we, undivided
Undecided

What I could do

512,In France They Kiss On Main Street,"Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him
They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches & schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars
Kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing ""Bye, Bye, Love""
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rolling

Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing?
I know you're ready, show that ass
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it
Girl, I wanna kiss it
While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me (Ha, look)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
A-A-All that ass, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, this liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-dick her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as fuck in these Margielas
I skate past, a nigga better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, bitch nervous
Better ride this wave, bitch, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
And she only got time for a nigga if I take her out to eat
A nigga really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the pussy
I don't work for the pussy, nigga really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Ha, bitch, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late, ha

While you kissing your girlfriends
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Bow your head to a king, nigga
Dreams house, my dreams bigger
Got a deck of cards if my heart switch up
Ace of Spades, her eyes lit up
Diamonds glitter in my car, thriller
She pray for me, that's God willin'
I'm hard to break, my bars prison
Her new name, Ass-Zilla
She love a nigga and that pussy tight
Come through, fuck you all night
Some foreplay, that's all right
But she'd rather do number 69
High notes, it's prime time
On a couch, hit it from behind
Hit you with that large stroke
Now she fiendin' for that good dope, yeah
Ha, that's my bae, she cook and clean, I got it made
Handcuff like she a slave
Touch ya, let your tongue taste
So high, no ceilin' space
Numb to it, can't feel her face
Yeah, she numb to it, can't feel her face

Girl, you know we got the time
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing? (I know)

Girl, I wanna kiss it (I wanna kiss it right there)
While you kissing your girlfriends (Oh-whoa)
I wanna see a whole lot of licking, that's a memory (I bet I—)
Yeah, bet I make that pussy remember me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Blowin' up the line on my cellular
She wanna lock a nigga down on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own the dick
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw the bitch, ha
Momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every nigga wanna talk to her but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back is my theme music
Her ass on my mind, I dream booty
Any nigga tryna fuck my bitch
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My rings ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Ha, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
Car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
Smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Helipad on the boat
Chillin' in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothin' compare to what's in my pants
Girl, stop playin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Oh-oh, babe
Girl, you know we got the time (We go the time, so later on, what are we doing?)
Got that pussy on my mind, later on, what are we doing? (Oh-oh)
I know you're ready, show that ass (Getting horny, babe)
Girl, you looking so bad, getting horny watching you do it

514,Since I Fell For You,"When you just give love, and never get love
You'd better let love depart

I know it's so, and still I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love, and now you've gone
Since I fell for you ...

My life has been such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you ...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get these blues most every night
Since I fell for you ...

Well it's too bad, and it's too sad
That I'm in love with you...

When you love me, and then you snub me
But what can I do, I'm still in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]

[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshiped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

[Bridge]
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Don't watch movies, don't go to plays
I watch cuties, porn, and play
I got Uzis on the way
I don't be choosey, I don't be safe
I don't get woozy, I get the waist

I been sleepin' with my AK, with my finger around her waist
I been dreamin' I caught a body —
That's some sweet dreams, who want a taste?
Give the American dream to a bitch that ain't even from the USA
That's the land of the Free, it's the home of AJ
Got a whole brick of some yay, I put one line on the plate
She's gon' take it to the face, like ""Thin line between love and hate""
I got Dealers 'N' Associates, call that my DNA
All these diamonds, all this gold and shit, call that PB&J
I got Bloods in LA, I got Bloods down in the A
I got Bloods everywhere you lay but ain't no blood in my filet
Hit the court, shoot the DA, treat beef like USDA
OMW to your trap, (Blap!) — Now I'll be On My Way
I got plugs I ain't got to pay, I got shit I ain't got to say
I got cribs way out of state, I ain't got no more pocket space
Sippin' slo-mo at my pace, lean like I wear a brace
Queens want to be embraced, Kings want to be an Ace
I remember Ace of Spades, I remember the Goose is Grey

Believe we deserve every leaf in the forest
Kis and quarters layin' around my headquarters
Borderline hoarder, you a mortal, I report her
World on my shoulders but it's lighter than a clover
I'm your bitch, baby, hold me tighter than a stroller
System so solar, got white like Crayola
Nut like granola all in your bitch rollers
You never been in jail, I never been in a Corolla
Then I roll a blunt 'bout as thick as a Samoan
This is that six shit, the sickness is showin'
The sickness is spreadin', the disease is growin'
The bitches is hoein', the witnesses knowin'
The dollars are torn, they're fishin' for coins

She asked me for my nut tree
And my golden pear

Never did I see
I'll give you all the fruit
From my little nut tree.”

536,Abyssinia Jones,"Hasan Of Bassorah.[FN#5]


There was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a merchant, who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore. But in due time Allah, the All-hearing the All-knowing, decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High; so he died, and his two sons laid him out and buried him, after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop.[FN#6] Presently the elder son, Hasan hight, a youth of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, betook himself to the company of lewd folk, women and low boys, frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done, for that he exulted in the abundance of his good. After some time he had wasted all his ready money, so he sold all his father's lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing, neither little nor muchel, nor was one of his comrades left who knew him. He abode thus anhungred, he and his widowed mother, three days, and on the fourth day, as he walked along, unknowing whither to wend, there met him a man of his father's friends, who questioned him of his case. He told him what had befallen him and the other said, ""O my son, I have a brother who is a goldsmith; an thou wilt, thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein."" Hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother, to whom he commended him, saying, ""In very sooth this is my son; do thou teach him for my sake."" So Hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft; and Allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself. One day, as he sat in his booth in the bazar, there came up to him an Ajamí, a foreigner, a Persian, with a great white beard and a white turband[FN#7] on his head, having the semblance of a merchant who, after saluting him, looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly. It pleased him and he shook his head, saying, ""By Allah, thou art a cunning goldsmith! What may be thy name?"" ""Hasan,"" replied the other, shortly.[FN#8] The Persian continued to look at his wares, whilst Hasan read in an old book[FN#9] he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace, till the hour of midafternoon prayer, when the shop became clear of people and the Persian accosted the young man, saying, ""O my son, thou art a comely youth! What book is that? Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art, than which there is no goodlier in the world.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian accosted the young man saying, ""O my son, thou art a comely youth! Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world. Many have sought of me instruction therein, but I consented not to instruct any of them in it; yet hath my soul consented that I teach it to thee, for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier, so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil,[FN#10] charcoal and fire."" Hasan asked, ""O my lord and when wilt thou teach me this?""; and the Persian answered, ""To-morrow, Inshallah, I will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper."" Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian till nightfall, when he took leave of him and going in to his mother, saluted her with the salam and ate with her; but he was dazed, without memory or reason, for that the stranger's words had gotten hold upon his heart. So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the Persian, which when she heard, her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom, saying, ""O my son, beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk, and especially of the Persians, and obey them not in aught; for they are sharpers and tricksters, who profess the art of alchemy[FN#11] and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain."" Replied Hasan, ""O my mother, we are paupers and have nothing he may covet, that he should put a cheat on us. Indeed, this Persian is a right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him; Allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son."" She was silent in her chagrin, and he passed the night without sleep, his heart being full of what the Persian had said to him; nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein. But when morning morrowed, he rose and taking the keys, opened the shop, whereupon behold, the Persian accosted him. Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands; but he forbade him from this and suffered it not, saying, ""O Hasan, set on the crucible and apply the bellows.""[FN#12] So he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal. Then said the Persian, ""O my son, hast thou any copper?"" and he replied, ""I have a broken platter."" So he bade him work the shears[FN#13] and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows, till the copper became liquid, when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it, sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder.[FN#14] Then he bade Hasan blow upon it with the bellows, and he did so, till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold.[FN#15] When the youth saw this, he was stupefied and at his wits' end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality: whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persian's hand to kiss it. But he forbade him, saying, ""Art thou married?"" and when the youth replied ""No!"" he said, ""Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not."" So Hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker, who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold. So they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams,[FN#16] at which price he sold it and taking the money, went home and told his mother all that had passed, saying, ""O my mother, I have learnt this art and mystery."" But she laughed at him, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried, ""I have learnt this art and mystery,"" she laughed at him, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; and she was silent for vexation. Then of his ignorance, he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop, laid it before the Persian, who was still sitting there and asked him, ""O my son, what wilt thou do with this mortar?"" Hasan answered, ""Let us put it in the fire, and make of it lumps of gold."" The Persian laughed and rejoined, ""O my son, art thou Jinn-mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day? Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost? Now, O my son, an I teach thee this craft, thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth; for that will suffice thee from year to year."" Cried Hasan, ""True, O my lord,"" and sitting down in his open shop, set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire. Quoth the Persian, ""What wilt thou, O my son?""; and quoth Hasan, ""Teach me this craft."" ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" exclaimed the Persian, laughing; ""Verily, O my son, thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft. Did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars? If we busy ourselves with it here, the folk will say of us, These practise alchemy; and the magistrates will hear of us, and we shall lose our lives.[FN#17] Wherefore, O my son, an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright, come thou with me to my house."" So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajamí; but by the way he remembered his mother's words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still, with bowed head. The Persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him, ""Art thou mad? What! I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm thee!"" presently adding, ""But, if thou fear to go with me to my house, I will go with thee to thine and teach thee there."" Hasan replied, ""'Tis well, O uncle,"" and the Persian rejoined, ""Go thou before me."" So Hasan led the way to his own house, and entering, told his mother of the Persian's coming, for he had left him standing at the door. She ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it, her son bade her go to one of the neighbours' lodgings. So she left her home to them and wended her way, whereupon Hasan brought in the Persian, who entered after asking leave. Then he took in hand a dish and going to the market, returned with food, which he set before the Persian, saying, ""Eat, O my lord, that between us there may be bread and salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt!"" The Persian replied with a smile, ""True, O my son! Who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt?""[FN#18] Then he came forward and ate with Hasan, till they were satisfied; after which the Ajami said, ""O my son Hasan, bring us somewhat of sweetmeats."" So Hasan went to the market, rejoicing in his words, and returned with ten saucers[FN#19] of sweetmeats, of which they both ate and the Persian said, ""May Allah abundantly requite thee, O my son! It is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him!""[FN#20] Then said he, ""O Hasan bring the gear."" But hardly did Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring-tide, and hastening to the shop, fetched the apparatus and set it before the Persian, who pulled out a piece of paper and said, ""O Hasan, by the bond of bread and salt, wert thou not dearer to me than my son, I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art, for I have none of the Elixir[FN#21] left save what is in this paper; but by and by I will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee. Know, O my son Hasan, that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper, and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold;"" presently adding, ""O my son, O Hasan, there are in this paper three ounces,[FN#22] Egyptian measure, and when it is spent, I will make thee other and more."" Hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder, finer than the first, said to the Persian, ""O my lord, what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made?"" But he laughed, longing to get hold of the youth, and replied, ""Of what dost thou question? Indeed thou art a froward boy! Do thy work and hold thy peace."" So Hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house, shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting-pot; then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold. When he saw this, he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold; but, whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting-pot, the Persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang, which if an elephant smelt, he would sleep from night to night, and cutting off a little thereof, put it in a piece of the sweetmeat. Then said he, ""O Hasan, thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth, and I have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace. Now I see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee; wherefore, if it be Allah's will, I will marry thee to her."" Replied Hasan, ""I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the Almighty!"" and the Persian rejoined, ""O my son, have fair patience and fair shall betide thee."" Therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand, put it in his mouth, knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future. But hardly had he swallowed it, when he fell down, head foregoing heels, and was lost to the world; whereupon the Persian, seeing him in such calamitous case, rejoiced exceedingly and cried, ""Thou hast fallen into my snares, O gallows-carrion, O dog of the Arabs! This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee, O Hasan!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell fainting to the ground, the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried, ""This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee!"" Then he girt himself and pinioned Hasan's arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest, which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him. Moreover, he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasan's valuables, together with the piece of the first gold-lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock. Then he ran to the market and fetching a porter, took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city, where he set them down on the sea-shore, hard by a vessel at anchor there. Now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him; so, when the crew saw him, they came to him and bore the two chests on board. Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain, saying, ""Up and let us be off, for I have done my desire and won my wish."" So the skipper sang out to the sailors, saying, ""Weigh anchor and set sail!"" And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind. So far concerning the Persian; but as regards Hasan's mother, she awaited him till supper-time but heard neither sound nor news of him; so she went to the house and finding it thrown open, entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables; wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him; and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying, ""Alas, my son, ah! Alas, the fruit of my vitals, ah!"" And she recited these couplets,

""My patience fails me and grows anxiety; * And with your absence
       &nbsp     growth of grief I see.
By Allah, Patience went what time ye went! * Loss of all Hope how
       &nbsp     suffer patiently?
When lost my loved one how can' joy I sleep? * Who shall enjoy
       &nbsp     such life of low degree?
Thou 'rt gone and, desolating house and home, * Hast fouled the
       &nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free:
Thou wast my fame, my grace 'mid folk, my stay; * Mine aid wast
       &nbsp     thou in all adversity!
Perish the day, when from mine eyes they bore * My friend, till
       &nbsp     sight I thy return to me!""

And she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn, when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son, and she told them what had befallen him with the Persian, assured that she should never, never see him again. Then she went round about the house, weeping, and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall; so she sent for a scholar, who read them to her; and they were these,

""Leyla's phantom came by night, when drowsiness had overcome me,
       &nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the
       &nbsp     desert,
But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air
       &nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distant.""[FN#23]

When Hasan's mother heard these lines, she shrieked and said, ""Yes, O my son! Indeed, the house is desolate and the visitation-place is distant!"" Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son, went away; but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasan's name and the date of his loss, and thenceforward she quitted it not, but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day. Such was her case; but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami, this Persian was a Magian, who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power. He was a lewd and filthy villain, a hankerer after alchemy, an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards, such an one as he of whom quoth the poet,

""A dog, dog-fathered, by dog-grandsire bred; * No good in dog
       &nbsp     from dog race issued:
E'en for a gnat no resting-place gives he * Who is composed of
       &nbsp     seed by all men shed.""[FN#24]

The name of this accursed was Bahrám the Guebre, and he was wont, every year, to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes. So, when he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith, they sailed on from dawn till dark, when the ship made fast to the shore for the night, and at sunrise, when they set sail again, Bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan. They did so, and he opened it and taking out the young man, made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils. Hasan sneezed and vomited the Bhang; then, opening his eyes, he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail, and saw the Persian sitting by him; wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him. So he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer, to wit, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verity, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! O my God, be Thou gracious to me in Thine appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction, O Lord of the three Worlds!"" Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him softly, saying, ""O my father, what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me?""[FN#25] But Bahram stared at him and replied, ""O dog, knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt? I have slain of youths like thee a thousand, save one, and thou shalt make up the thousand."" And he cried out at him and Hasan was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-second Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in wrath, so he was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him. Then the accursed bade loose his pinion-bonds and they gave him a little water to drink, whilst the Magian laughed and said, ""By the virtue of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat, methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets! But the Fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee, that I might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice, to her[FN#26] so she may accept of me."" Quoth Hasan, ""Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt""; whereupon the Magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and, biting the deck with his fore-teeth, swooned away, whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks. Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan said, ""What wilt thou do with it?"" Replied the Magian, ""This is the Fire, lady of light and sparkles bright! This it is I worship, and if thou wilt worship her even as I, verily I will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter."" Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at him, ""Woe to thee! Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway, Creator of Night and Day; and this is naught but a calamity among creeds!"" At this the Magian was wroth and said to him, ""Wilt thou not then conform with me, O dog of the Arabs, and enter my faith?"" But Hasan consented not to this: so the accursed Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire, bade his pages throw him flat on his face. They did so, and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs[FN#27] till his flanks were laid open, whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him, and besought protection, but none protected him. Then he raised his eyes to the All-powerful King and sought of Him succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet. And indeed patience failed him; his tears ran down his cheeks, like rain, and he repeated these couplets twain,

""In patience, O my God, Thy doom forecast * I'll bear, an thereby
       &nbsp     come Thy grace at last:
They've dealt us wrong, transgressed and ordered ill; * Haply Thy
       &nbsp    Grace shall pardon what is past.""

Then the Magian bade his negro-slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink. So they sat food before him; but he consented not to eat or drink; and Bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage, whilst Hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory; whereby the Guebre's heart was hardened against him. They ceased not to sail the sea three months, during which time Hasan was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship, by reason of the fierce gale; whereupon quoth the captain and crew,[FN#28] ""By Allah, this is all on account of yonder youth, who hath been these three months in torture with this Magian. Indeed, this is not allowed of God the Most High."" Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all who were with him; which when he saw, he made sure of death and feared for himself. So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on, clad him in others; and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land, saying, ""O my son, return me not evil for that I have done with thee."" Quoth Hasan, ""How can I ever rely upon thee again?""; and quoth Bahram, ""O my son, but for sin, there were no pardon. Indeed, I did all these doings with thee, but to try thy patience, and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of Allah."" So the crew and captain rejoiced in Hasan's release, and he called down blessings on them and praised the Almighty and thanked Him. With this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage. Then said Hasan to Bahram, ""O Master,[FN#29] whither wendest thou?"" Replied the Magian, ""O, my son, I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds, where is the Elixir which we use in alchemy."" And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him. So Hasan's heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persian's words, he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian, who clad him in his own raiment. They ceased not sailing on other three months, when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles, white and yellow and sky-blue and black and every other hue, and the Magian sprang up and said, ""O Hasan, come, let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will."" So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram, after the Persian had commended his goods to the captain's care. They walked on inland, till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight, when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle-drum[FN#30] of copper and a silken strap, worked in gold with characts, beat the drum with the strap, until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste. Hasan marvelled at the Magian's doings and was afraid of him: he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed. But Bahram looked at him and said, ""What aileth thee, O my son? By the truth of the Fire and the Light, thou hast naught to fear from me; and, were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means, I had not brought thee ashore. So rejoice in all good; for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian said to Hasan, ""In very sooth yonder dust-cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof."" Presently the dust lifted off three she-dromedaries, one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan another. Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days, till they came to a wide champaign and, descending into its midst, they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold; so they alighted and entering thereunder, ate and drank and took their rest. Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the Magian, ""What is that, O nuncle?"" Bahram replied, ""'Tis a palace,"" and quoth Hasan, ""Wilt thou not go thither, that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it?"" But the Persian was wroth and said, ""Name not to me yonder palace; for therein dwelleth a foe, with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee."" Then he beat the kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries, and they mounted and fared on other seven days. On the eighth day, the Magian said, ""O Hasan, what seest thou?"" Hasan replied, ""I see clouds and mists twixt east and west."" Quoth Bahram, ""That is neither clouds nor mists, but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split,[FN#31] and there are no clouds above it, for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation. Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek. 'Tis for that I brought thee hither, for my wish may not be won save at thy hands. Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the Magian, ""By the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest, I conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me!"" Bahram replied, ""The art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split. Such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it; and when we have it, I will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn."" Hasan answered, in his fear, ""'Tis well, O my master;"" and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead, repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets,

""Consider but thy Lord, His work shall bring * Comfort to thee,
       &nbsp   with quick relief and near:
Despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane: * In bane how many
       &nbsp   blessed boons appear!""

They ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted; and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked Bahram, ""What be yonder palace?""; whereto he answered, ""'Tis the abode of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans."" Then the Magian alighted and making Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him, ""Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee, for I will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace; and I conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom; and I and thou will share equally therein."" And Hasan replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Then Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat, ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour; after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks. Then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries. He chose out one and said, ""Hearken, O my son, O Hasan, to what I am about to enjoin on thee;"" and Hasan replied, ""'Tis well."" Bahram continued, ""Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground; whereupon the Rakham birds[FN#32] will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain-top. Take this knife with thee; and, when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down, slit open therewith the skin and come forth. The vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away; whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me, and I will tell thee what to do."" So he sewed him up in the skin, placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water, and withdrew to a distance. Presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up, flew away with him to the mountain-top and there set him down. As soon as Hasan felt himself on the ground, he slit the skin and coming forth, called out to the Magian, who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy, saying to him, ""Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest."" Hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood, told Bahram, who said to him, ""This be what we need and seek. Make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me, for this is wherewithal we do alchemy."" So he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to Hasan, ""O gallows bird, I have won my wish of thee; and now, if thou wilt, thou mayst abide on this mountain, or cast thyself down to the earth and perish. So saying, he left him[FN#33] and went away, and Hasan exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This hound hath played the traitor with me."" And he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets,

""When God upon a man possessed of reasoning, Hearing and sight
       &nbsp   His will in aught to pass would bring,
He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit, From
       &nbsp    him, as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling;
Till, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back His wit, That
       &nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing.
So say thou not of aught that haps, 'How happened it?' For Fate
       &nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything.[FN#34]""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Magian sent Hasan to the mountain-top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This damned hound hath played the traitor."" Then he rose to his feet and looked right and left, after which he walked on along the mountain top, in mind making certain of death. He fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain, along which he saw a dark-blue sea, dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount. So he sat down and repeated what he might of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his troubles, or by death or by deliverance from such strait. Then he recited for himself the funeral-prayer[FN#35] and cast himself down into the main; but, the waves bore him up by Allah's grace, so that he reached the water unhurt, and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him, so that the billows bore him safe to land, by the decree of the Most High. Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty Allah and thanked Him; after which he walked on in quest of something to eat, for stress of hunger, and came presently to the place where he had halted with the Magian, Bahram. Then he fared on awhile, till behold, he caught sight of a great palace, rising high in air, and knew it for that of which he had questioned the Persian and he had replied, ""Therein dwelleth a foe, of mine."" Hasan said to himself, ""By Allah, needs must I enter yonder palace; perchance relief awaiteth me there."" So coming to it and finding the gate open, he entered the vestibule, where he saw seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chess-cloth before them and they were at play. One of them raised her head to him and cried out for joy saying, ""By Allah, here is a son of Adam, and methinks 'tis he whom Bahram the Magian brought hither this year!"" So Hasan hearing her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and said, ""Yes, O my ladies, by Allah, I am indeed that unhappy."" Then said the younger damsel to her elder sister, ""Bear witness against me,[FN#36] O my sister, that this is my brother by covenant of Allah and that I will die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn for his mourning."" So saying, she rose and embraced him and kissed him and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her, led him into the palace, where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a suit of King's raiment wherewith she arrayed him. Moreover, she made ready all manner viands[FN#37] and set them before him, and sat and ate with him, she and her sister. Then said they to him, ""Tell us thy tale with yonder dog, the wicked, the wizard, from the time of thy falling into his hands to that of thy freeing thee from him; and after we will tell thee all that hath passed between us and him, so thou mayst be on thy guard against him an thou see him again."" Hearing these words and finding himself thus kindly received, Hasan took heart of grace and reason returned to him and he related to them all that had befallen him with the Magian from first to last. Then they asked, ""Didst thou ask him of this palace?""; and he answered, ""Yes, but he said, 'Name it not to me; for it belongeth to Ghuls and Satans.'"" At this, the two damsels waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said, ""Did that miscreant style us Ghuls and Satans?"" And Hasan answered, ""Yes."" Cried the younger sister, ""By Allah, I will assuredly do him die with the foulest death and make him to lack the wind of the world!"" Quoth Hasan, ""And how wilt thou get at him, to kill him, for he is a crafty magician?""; and quoth she, ""He is in a garden by name Al-Mushayyad,[FN#38] and there is no help but that I slay him before long."" Then said her sister, ""Sooth spake Hasan in everything he hath recounted to us of this cur; but now tell him our tale, that all of it may abide in his memory."" So the younger said to him, ""Know, O my brother, that we are the daughters of a King of the mightiest Kings of the Jann, having Marids for troops and guards and servants, and Almighty Allah blessed him with seven daughters by one wife; but of his folly such jealousy and stiff-neckedness and pride beyond compare gat hold upon him that he would not give us in marriage to any one and, summoning his Wazirs and Emirs, he said to them, 'Can ye tell me of any place untrodden by the tread of men and Jinn and abounding in trees and fruits and rills?' And quoth they, 'What wilt thou therewith, O King of the Age?' And quoth he, 'I desire there to lodge my seven daughters.' Answered they, 'O King, the place for them is the Castle of the Mountain of Clouds, built by an Ifrit of the rebellious Jinn, who revolted from the covenant of our lord Solomon, on whom be the peace! Since his destruction, none hath dwelt there, nor man nor Jinni, for 'tis cut off[FN#39] and none may win to it. And the Castle is girt about with trees and fruits and rills, and the water running around it is sweeter than honey and colder than snow: none who is afflicted with leprosy or elephantiasis[FN#40] or what not else drinketh thereof but he is healed forthright. Hearing this our father sent us hither, with an escort of his troops and guards and provided us with all that we need here. When he is minded to ride to us he beateth a kettle-drum, whereupon all his hosts present themselves before him and he chooseth whom he shall ride and dismisseth the rest; but, when he desireth that we shall visit him, he commandeth his followers, the enchanters, to fetch us and carry us to the presence; so he may solace himself with our society and we accomplish our desire of him; after which they again carry us back hither. Our five other sisters are gone a-hunting in our desert, wherein are wild beasts past compt or calculation and, it being our turn to do this we two abode at home, to make ready for them food. Indeed, we had besought Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) to vouchsafe us a son of Adam to cheer us with his company and praised be He who hath brought thee to us! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for no harm shall befal thee."" Hasan rejoiced and said, ""Alhamdolillah, laud to the Lord who guideth us into the path of deliverance and inclineth hearts to us!"" Then his sister[FN#41] rose and taking him by the hand, led him into a private chamber, where she brought out to him linen and furniture that no mortal can avail unto. Presently, the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with Hasan's case; whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber, saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety. Then he abode with them in all the solace of life and its joyance, riding out with them to the chase and taking his pleasure with them whilst they entreated him courteously and cheered him with converse, till his sadness ceased from him and he recovered health and strength and his body waxed stout and fat, by dint of fair treatment and pleasant time among the seven moons in that fair palace with its gardens and flowers; for indeed he led the delightsomest of lives with the damsels who delighted in him and he yet more in them. And they used to give him drink of the honey-dew of their lips[FN#42] these beauties with the high bosoms, adorned with grace and loveliness, the perfection of brilliancy and in shape very symmetry. Moreover the youngest Princess told her sisters how Bahram the Magian had made them of the Ghuls and Demons and Satans,[FN#43] and they sware that they would surely slay him. Next year the accursed Guebre again made his appearance, having with him a handsome young Moslem, as he were the moon, bound hand and foot and tormented with grievous tortures, and alighted with him below the palace-walls. Now Hasan was sitting under the trees by the side of the stream; and when he espied Bahram, his heart fluttered,[FN#44] his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith saw the Magian, his heart fluttered, his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand. Then he said to the Princesses, ""O my sisters, help me to the slaughter of this accursed, for here he is come back and in your grasp, and he leadeth with him captive a young Moslem of the sons of the notables, whom he is torturing with all manner grievous torments. Lief would I kill him and console my heart of him; and, by delivering the young Moslem from his mischief and restoring him to his country and kith and kin and friends, fain would I lay up merit for the world to come, by taking my wreak of him.[FN#45] This will be an almsdeed from you and ye will reap the reward thereof from Almighty Allah."" ""We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O our brother, O Hasan,"" replied they and binding chin-veils, armed themselves and slung on their swords: after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons. Then they all sallied out and found the Magian who had slaughtered and skinned a camel, ill-using the young Moslem, and saying to him, ""Sit thee in this hide."" So Hasan came behind him, without his knowledge, and cried out at him till he was dazed and amazed. Then he came up to him, saying, ""Hold thy hand, O accursed! O enemy of Allah and foe of the Moslems! O dog! O traitor! O thou that flame dost obey! O thou that walkest in the wicked ones' ways, worshipping the fire and the light and swearing by the shade and the heat!"" Herewith the Magian turned and seeing Hasan, thought to wheedle him and said to him, ""O my son, how diddest thou escape and who brought thee down to earth?"" Hasan replied, ""He delivered me, who hath appointed the taking of thy life to be at my hand, and I will torture thee even as thou torturedst me the whole way long. O miscreant, O atheist,[FN#46] thou hast fallen into the twist and the way thou hast missed; and neither mother shall avail thee nor brother, nor friend nor solemn covenant shall assist thee; for thou saidst, O accursed, Whoso betrayeth bread and salt, may Allah do vengeance upon him! And thou hast broken the bond of bread and salt; wherefore the Almighty hath thrown thee into my grasp, and far is thy chance of escape from me."" Rejoined Bahram, ""By Allah, O my son, O Hasan, thou art dearer to me than my sprite and the light of mine eyes!"" But Hasan stepped up to him and hastily smote him between the shoulders, that the sword issued gleaming from his throat-tendons and Allah hurried his soul to the fire, and abiding-place dire. Then Hasan took the Magian's bag and opened it, then having taken out the kettle-drum he struck it with the strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries like lightning. So he unbound the youth from his bonds and setting him on one of the camels, loaded him another with victual and water,[FN#47] saying, ""Wend whither thou wilt."" So he departed, after Almighty Allah had thus delivered him from his strait at the hands of Hasan. When the damsels saw their brother slay the Magian they joyed in him with exceeding joy and gat round him, marvelling at his valour and prowess,[FN#48] and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his safety, saying, ""O Hasan thou hast done a deed, whereby thou hast healed the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the King of Omnipotence!"" Then they returned to the palace, and he abode with them, eating and drinking and laughing and making merry; and indeed his sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his mother;[FN#49] but while he led with them this goodly life one day, behold, there arose from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened the welkin and made towards them. When the Princess saw this, they said to him, ""Rise, O Hasan, run to thy chamber and conceal thyself; or an thou wilt, go down into the garden and hide thyself among the trees and vines; but fear not, for no harm shall befal thee."" So he arose and entering his chamber, locked the door upon himself, and lay lurking in the palace. Presently the dust opened out and showed beneath it a great conquering host, as it were a surging sea, coming from the King, the father of the damsels. Now when the troops reached the castle, the Princesses received them with all honour and hospitably entertained them three days; after which they questioned them of their case and tidings and they replied saying, ""We come from the King in quest of you."" They asked, ""And what would the King with us?""; and the officers answered, ""One of the Kings maketh a marriage festival, and your father would have you be present thereat and take your pleasure therewith."" The damsels enquired, ""And how long shall we be absent from our place?""; and they rejoined, ""The time to come and go, and to sojourn may be two months."" So the Princesses arose and going in to the palace sought Hasan, acquainted him with the case and said to him, ""Verily this place is thy place and our house is thy house; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and feel nor grief nor fear, for none can come at thee here; but keep a good heart and a glad mind, till we return to thee. The keys of our chambers we leave with thee; but, O our brother, we beseech thee, by the bond of brotherhood, in very deed not to open such a door, for thou hast no need thereto."" Then they farewelled him and fared forth with the troops, leaving Hasan alone in the palace. It was not long before his breast grew straitened and his patience shortened: solitude and sadness were heavy on him and he sorrowed for his severance from them with passing chagrin. The palace for all its vastness, waxed small to him and finding himself sad and solitary, he bethought him of the damsels and their pleasant converse and recited these couplets,

""The wide plain is narrowed before these eyes * And the landscape
       &nbsp     troubles this heart of mine.
Since my friends went forth, by the loss of them * Joy fled and
       &nbsp     these eyelids rail floods of brine:
Sleep shunned these eyeballs for parting woe * And my mind is
       &nbsp    worn with sore pain and pine:
Would I wot an Time shall rejoin our lots * And the joys of love
       &nbsp    with night-talk combine.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,

She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the departure of the damsels, Hasan sat in the palace sad and solitary and his breast was straitened by severance. He used to ride forth a-hunting by himself in the wold and bring back the game and slaughter it and eat thereof alone: but melancholy and disquiet redoubled on him, by reason of his loneliness. So he arose and went round about the palace and explored its every part; he opened the Princesses' apartments and found therein riches and treasures fit to ravish the beholder's reason; but he delighted not in aught thereof, by reason of their absence. His heart was fired by thinking of the door they had charged him not to approach or open on any account and he said in himself, ""My sister had never enjoined me not to open this door, except there were behind it somewhat whereof she would have none to know; but, by Allah, I will arise and open it and see what is within, though within it were sudden death!"" Then he took the key and, opening the door,[FN#50] saw therein no treasure but he espied a vaulted and winding staircase of Yamani onyx at the upper end of the chamber. So he mounted the stair, which brought him out upon the terrace- roof of the palace, whence he looked down upon the gardens and vergiers, full of trees and fruits and beasts and birds warbling praises of Allah, the One, the All-powerful; and said in himself ""This is that they forbade to me."" He gazed upon these pleasaunces and saw beyond a surging sea, dashing with clashing billows, and he ceased not to explore the palace right and left, till he ended at a pavilion builded with alternate courses, two bricks of gold and one of silver and jacinth and emerald and supported by four columns. And in the centre he saw a sitting- room paved and lined with a mosaic of all manner precious stones such as rubies and emeralds and balasses and other jewels of sorts; and in its midst stood a basin[FN#51] brimful of water, over which was a trellis-work of sandalwood and aloes-wood reticulated with rods of red gold and wands of emerald and set with various kinds of jewels and fine pearls, each sized as a pigeon's egg. The trellis was covered with a climbing vine, bearing grapes like rubies, and beside the basin stood a throne of lign-aloes latticed with red gold, inlaid with great pearls and comprising vari-coloured gems of every sort and precious minerals each kind fronting each and symmetrically disposed. About it the birds warbled with sweet tongues and various voices celebrating the praises of Allah the Most High: brief, it was a palace such as nor Cæsar nor Chosroës ever owned; but Hasan saw therein none of the creatures of Allah, whereat he marvelled and said in himself, ""I wonder to which of the Kings this place pertaineth, or is it Many-Columned Iram whereof they tell, for who among mortals can avail to the like of this?"" And indeed he was amazed at the spectacle and sat down in the pavilion and cast glances around him marvelling at the beauty of its ordinance and at the lustre of the pearls and jewels and the curious works which therein were, no less than at the gardens and orchards aforesaid and at the birds that hymned the praises of Allah, the One, the Almighty; and he abode pondering the traces of him whom the Most High had enabled to rear that structure, for indeed He is muchel of might.[FN#52] And presently, behold, he espied ten birds[FN#53] flying towards the pavilion from the heart of the desert and knew that they were making the palace and bound for the basin, to drink of its waters: so he hid himself, for fear they should see him and take flight. They lighted on a great tree and a goodly and circled round about it; and he saw amongst them a bird of marvel-beauty, the goodliest of them all, and the nine stood around it and did it service; and Hasan marvelled to see it peck them with its bill and lord it over them while they fled from it. He stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and perched on the couch; after which each bird rent open its neck-skin with its claws and issued out of it; and lo! it was but a garment of feathers, and there came forth therefrom ten virgins, maids whose beauty shamed the brilliancy of the moon. They all doffed their clothes and plunging into the basin, washed and fell to playing and sporting one with other; whilst the chief bird of them lifted up the rest and ducked them down and they fled from her and dared not put forth their hands to her. When Hasan beheld her thus he took leave of his right reason and his sense was enslaved, so he knew that the Princesses had not forbidden him to open the door save because of this; for he fell passionately in love with her, for what he saw of her beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, as she played and sported and splashed the others with the water. He stood looking upon them whilst they saw him not, with eye gazing and heart burning and soul[FN#54] to evil prompting; and he sighed to be with them and wept for longing, because of the beauty and loveliness of the chief damsel. His mind was amazed at her charms and his heart taken in the net of her love; lowe was loosed in his heart for her sake and there waxed on him a flame, whose sparks might not be quenched, and desire, whose signs might not be hidden. Presently, they came up out of that basin, whilst Hasan marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the tokens of inner gifts in the elegance of their movements. Then he cast a glance at the chief damsel who stood mother- naked and there was manifest to him what was between her thighs a goodly rounded dome on pillars borne, like a bowl of silver or crystal, which recalled to him the saying of the poet,[FN#55]

""When I took up her shift and discovered the terrace-roof of her
       &nbsp     kaze, I found it as strait as my humour or eke my worldly
       &nbsp     ways:
So I thrust it, incontinent, in, halfway, and she heaved a sigh.
       &nbsp    'For what dost thou sigh?' quoth I. 'For the rest of it
       &nbsp    sure,' she says.""

Then coming out of the water they all put on their dresses and ornaments, and the chief maiden donned a green dress,[FN#56] wherein she surpassed for loveliness all the fair ones of the world and the lustre of her face outshone the resplendent full moons: she excelled the branches with the grace of her bending gait and confounded the wit with apprehension of disdain; and indeed she was as saith the poet,[FN#57]

""A maiden 'twas, the dresser's art had decked with cunning
       &nbsp    sleight;
The sun thou 'd'st say had robbed her cheek and shone with
       &nbsp    borrowed light.
She came to us apparelled fair in under vest of green,
Like as the ripe pomegranate hides beneath its leafy screen;
And when we asked her what might be the name of what she wore,
She answered in a quaint reply that double meaning bore:
The desert's heart we penetrate in such apparel dressed,
And Pierce-heart therefore is the name by which we call the
       &nbsp     vest.""

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan saw the damsels issue forth the basin, the chief maiden robbed his reason with her beauty and loveliness compelling him to recite the couplets forequoted. And after dressing they sat talking and laughing, whilst he stood gazing on them, drowned in the sea of his love, burning in the flames of passion and wandering in the Wady of his melancholy thought. And he said to himself, ""By Allah, my sister forbade me not to open the door, but for cause of these maidens and for fear lest I should fall in love with one of them! How, O Hasan shalt thou woo and win them? How bring down a bird flying in the vasty firmament? By Allah thou hast cast thyself into a bottomless sea and snared thyself in a net whence there is no escape! I shall die desolate and none shall wot of my death."" And he continued to gaze on the charms of the chief damsel, who was the loveliest creature Allah had made in her day, and indeed she outdid in beauty all human beings. She had a mouth magical as Solomon's seal and hair blacker than the night of estrangement to the love-despairing man; her brow was bright as the crescent moon of the Feast of Ramazán[FN#58] and her eyes were like eyes wherewith gazelles scan; she had a polished nose straight as a cane and cheeks like blood-red anemones of Nu'uman, lips like coralline and teeth like strung pearls in carcanets of gold virgin to man, and a neck like an ingot of silver, above a shape like a wand of Bán: her middle was full of folds, a dimpled plain such as enforceth the distracted lover to magnify Allah and extol His might and main, and her navel[FN#59] an ounce of musk, sweetest of savour could contain: she had thighs great and plump, like marble columns twain or bolsters stuffed with down from ostrich ta'en, and between them a somewhat, as it were a hummock great of span or a hare with ears back lain while terrace-roof and pilasters completed the plan; and indeed she surpassed the bough of the myrobalan with her beauty and symmetry, and the Indian rattan, for she was even as saith of them the poet whom love did unman,[FN#60]

""Her lip-dews rival honey-sweets, that sweet virginity; *
       &nbsp     Keener than Hindi scymitar the glance she casts at thee:
She shames the bending bough of Bán with graceful movement slow *
       &nbsp     And as she smiles her teeth appear with leven's brilliancy:
When I compared with rose a-bloom the tintage of her cheeks, *
       &nbsp    She laughed in scorn and cried, 'Whoso compares with rosery
My hue and breasts, granados terms, is there no shame in him? *
       &nbsp    How should pomegranates bear on bough such fruit in form or
       &nbsp    blee?
Now by my beauty and mine eyes and heart and eke by Heaven *
       &nbsp    Of favours mine and by the Hell of my unclemency,
They say 'She is a garden-rose in very pride of bloom'; *
       &nbsp   And yet no rose can ape my cheek nor branch my symmetry!
If any garden own a thing which unto me is like, *
       &nbsp   What then is that he comes to crave of me and only me?""'

They ceased not to laugh and play, whilst Hasan stood still a-watching them, forgetting meat and drink, till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when the beauty, the chief damsel, said to her mates, ""O Kings' daughters, it waxeth late and our land is afar and we are weary of this stead. Come, therefore, let us depart to our own place."" So they all arose and donned their feather vests, and becoming birds as they were before, flew away all together, with the chief lady in their midst. Then, Hasan, despairing of their return, would have arisen and gone down into the palace but could not move or even stand; wherefore the tears ran down his cheeks and passion was sore on him and he recited these couplets,

""May God deny me boon of troth if I * After your absence sweets
       &nbsp    of slumber know:
Yea; since that sev'rance never close mine eyes, * Nor rest
       &nbsp     repose me since departed you!
'Twould seem as though you saw me in your sleep; * Would Heaven
       &nbsp     the dreams of sleep were real-true!
Indeed I dote on sleep though needed not, * For sleep may bring
       &nbsp    me that dear form to view.""

Then Hasan walked on, little by little, heeding not the way he went, till he reached the foot of the stairs, whence he dragged himself to his own chamber; then he entered and shutting the door, lay sick eating not nor drinking and drowned in the sea of his solitude. He spent the night thus, weeping and bemoaning himself, till the morning, and when it morrowed he repeated these couplets,

""The birds took flight at eve and winged their way; * And sinless
       &nbsp    he who died of Love's death-blow.
I'll keep my love-tale secret while I can * But, an desire
       &nbsp    prevail, its needs must show:
Night brought me nightly vision, bright as dawn; * While nights
       &nbsp    of my desire lack morning-glow.
I mourn for them[FN#61] while they heart-freest sleep * And winds
       &nbsp     of love on me their plaything blow:
Free I bestow my tears, my wealth, my heart * My wit, my sprite:
       &nbsp     most gain who most bestow!
The worst of woes and banes is enmity * Beautiful maidens deal us
       &nbsp     to our woe.
Favour they say's forbidden to the fair * And shedding lovers'
       &nbsp     blood their laws allow;
That naught can love-sicks do but lavish soul, * And stake in
       &nbsp    love-play life on single throw:[FN#62]
I cry in longing ardour for my love: * Lover can only weep and
       &nbsp    wail Love-lowe.""

When the sun rose he opened the door, went forth of the chamber and mounted to the stead where he was before: then he sat down facing the pavilion and awaited the return of the birds till nightfall; but they returned not; wherefore he wept till he fell to the ground in a fainting-fit. When he came to after his swoon, he dragged himself down the stairs to his chamber; and indeed, the darkness was come and straitened upon him was the whole world and he ceased not to weep and wail himself through the livelong night, till the day broke and the sun rained over hill and dale its rays serene. He ate not nor drank nor slept, nor was there any rest for him; but by day he was distracted and by night distressed, with sleeplessness delirious and drunken with melancholy thought and excess of love-longing. And he repeated the verses of the love-distraught poet,

""O thou who shamest sun in morning sheen * The branch
       &nbsp     confounding, yet with nescience blest;
Would Heaven I wot an Time shall bring return * And quench the
       &nbsp     fires which flame unmanifest,—
Bring us together in a close embrace, * Thy cheek upon my cheek,
       &nbsp     thy breast abreast!
Who saith, In Love dwells sweetness? when in Love * Are bitterer
       &nbsp    days than Aloës[FN#63] bitterest.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-eighty Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith felt love redouble upon him, he recited those lines; and, as he abode thus in the stress of his love-distraction, alone and finding none to cheer him with company, behold, there arose a dust-cloud from the desert, wherefore he ran down and hid himself knowing that the Princesses who owned the castle had returned. Before long, the troops halted and dismounted round the palace and the seven damsels alighted and entering, put off their arms and armour of war. As for the youngest, she stayed not to doff her weapons and gear, but went straight to Hasan's chamber, where finding him not, she sought for him, till she lighted on him in one of the sleeping closets hidden, feeble and thin, with shrunken body and wasted bones and indeed his colour was changed and his eyes sunken in his face for lack of food and drink and for much weeping, by reason of his love and longing for the young lady. When she saw him in this plight, she was confounded and lost her wits; but presently she questioned him of his case and what had befallen him, saying, ""Tell me what aileth thee, O my brother, that I may contrive to do away thine affliction, and I will be thy ransom!""[FN#64] Whereupon he wept with sore weeping and by way of reply he began reciting,

""Lover, when parted from the thing he loves, * Has naught save
       &nbsp  weary woe and bane to bear.
Inside is sickness, outside living lowe, * His first is fancy and
       &nbsp    his last despair.""

When his sister heard this, she marvelled at his eloquence and loquent speech and his readiness at answering her in verse and said to him, ""O my brother, when didst thou fall into this thy case and what hath betided thee, that I find thee speaking in song and shedding tears that throng? Allah upon thee, O my brother, and by the honest love which is between us, tell me what aileth thee and discover to me thy secret, nor conceal from me aught of that which hath befallen thee in our absence; for my breast is straitened and my life is troubled because of thee."" He sighed and railed tears like rain, after which he said, ""I fear, O my sister, if I tell thee, that thou wilt not aid me to win my wish but wilt leave me to die wretchedly in mine anguish."" She replied, ""No, by Allah, O my brother, I will not abandon thee, though it cost me my life!"" So he told her all that had befallen him, and that the cause of his distress and affliction was the passion he had conceived for the young lady whom he had seen when he opened the forbidden door; and how he had not tasted meat nor drink for ten days past. Then he wept with sore weeping and recited these couplets,

""Restore my heart as 'twas within my breast, * Let mine eyes
       &nbsp     sleep again, then fly fro' me.
Deem ye the nights have had the might to change * Love's vow?
       &nbsp     Who changeth may he never be!""

His sister wept for his weeping and was moved to ruth for his case and pitied his strangerhood; so she said to him, ""O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I will venture being and risk existence to content thee and devise thee a device wherewith, though it cost me my dear life and all I hold dear, thou mayst get possession of her and accomplish thy desire, if such be the will of Allah Almighty. But I charge thee, O my brother, keep the matter secret from my sisterhood and discover not thy case to any one of them, lest my life be lost with thy life. An they question thee of opening the forbidden door, reply to them, 'I opened it not; no, never; but I was troubled at heart for your absence and by my loneliness here and yearning for you.'""[FN#65] And he answered, ""Yes: this is the right rede."" So he kissed her head and his heart was comforted and his bosom broadened. He had been nigh upon death for excess of affright, for he had gone in fear of her by reason of his having opened the door; but now his life and soul returned to him. Then he sought of her somewhat of food and after serving it she left him, and went in to her sisters, weeping and mourning for him. They questioned her of her case and she told them how she was heavy at heart for her brother, because he was sick and for ten days no food had found way into his stomach. So they asked the cause of his sickness and she answered, ""The reason was our severance from him and our leaving him desolate; for these days we have been absent from him were longer to him than a thousand years and scant blame to him, seeing he is a stranger, and solitary and we left him alone, with none to company with him or hearten his heart; more by token that he is but a youth and may be he called to mind his family and his mother, who is a woman in years, and bethought him that she weepeth for him all whiles of the day and watches of the night, ever mourning his loss; and we used to solace him with our society and divert him from thinking of her."" When her sisters heard these words they wept in the stress of their distress for him and said, ""Wa'lláhi—'fore Allah, he is not to blame!"" Then they went out to the army and dismissed it, after which they went into Hasan and saluted him with the salam. When they saw his charms changed with yellow colour and shrunken body, they wept for very pity and sat by his side and comforted him and cheered him with converse, relating to him all they had seen by the way of wonders and rarities and what had befallen the bridegroom with the bride. They abode with him thus a whole month, tendering him and caressing him with words sweeter than syrup; but every day sickness was added to his sickness, which when they saw, they bewept him with sore weeping, and the youngest wept even more than the rest. At the end of this time, the Princesses having made up their minds to ride forth a-hunting and a-birding invited their sister to accompany them, but she said, ""By Allah, O my sisters, I cannot go forth with you whilst my brother is in this plight, nor indeed till he be restored to health and there cease from him that which is with him of affliction. Rather will I sit with him and comfort him."" They thanked her for her kindness and said to her, ""Allah will requite thee all thou dost with this stranger."" Then they left her with him in the palace and rode forth taking with them twenty days' victual;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princesses mounted and rode forth a-hunting and a-birding, after leaving in the palace their youngest sister sitting by Hasan's side; and as soon as the damsel knew that they had covered a long distance from home, she went in to him and said, ""O my brother, come, show me the place where thou sawest the maidens."" He rejoiced in her words, making sure of winning his wish, and replied, ""Bismillah! On my head!"" Then he essayed to rise and show her the place, but could not walk; so she took him up in her arms, holding him to her bosom between her breasts; and, opening the staircase-door, carried him to the top of the palace, and he showed her the pavilion where he had seen the girls and the basin of water, wherein they had bathed. Then she said to him, ""Set forth to me, O my brother, their case and how they came."" So he described to her whatso he had seen of them and especially the girl of whom he was enamoured; but hearing these words she knew her and her cheeks paled and her case changed. Quoth he, ""O my sister, what aileth thee to wax wan and be troubled?""; and quoth she, ""O my brother, know thou that this young lady is the daughter of a Sovran of the Jann, of one of the most puissant of their Kings, and her father had dominion over men and Jinn and wizards and Cohens and tribal chiefs and guards and countries and cities and islands galore and hath immense wealth in store. Our father is a Viceroy and one of his vassals and none can avail against him, for the multitude of his many and the extent of his empire and the muchness of his monies. He hath assigned to his offspring, the daughters thou sawest, a tract of country, a whole year's journey in length and breadth, a region girt about with a great river and a deep; and thereto none may attain, nor man nor Jann. He hath an army of women, smiters with swords and lungers with lances, five-and-twenty thousand in number, each of whom, whenas she mounteth steed and donneth battle-gear, eveneth a thousand knights of the bravest. Moreover, he hath seven daughters, who in valour and prowess equal and even excel their sisters,[FN#66] and he hath made the eldest of them, the damsel whom thou sawest,[FN#67] queen over the country aforesaid and who is the wisest of her sisters and in valour and horsemanship and craft and skill and magic excels all the folk of her dominions. The girls who companied with her are the ladies of her court and guards and grandees of her empire, and the plumed skins wherewith they fly are the handiwork of enchanters of the Jann. Now an thou wouldst get possession of this queen and wed this jewel seld-seen and enjoy her beauty and loveliness and grace, do thou pay heed to my words and keep them in thy memory. They resort to this place on the first day of every month; and thou must take seat here and watch for them; and when thou seest them coming hide thee near the pavilion sitting where thou mayst see them, without being seen of them, and beware, again beware lest thou show thyself, or we shall all lose our lives. When they doff their dress note which is the feather-suit of her whom thou lovest and take it, and it only, for this it is that carrieth her to her country, and when thou hast mastered it, thou hast mastered her. And beware lest she wile thee, saying, 'O thou who hast robbed my raiment, restore it to me, because here am I in thine hands and at thy mercy!' For, an thou give it her, she will kill thee and break down over us palace and pavilion and slay our sire: know, then, thy case and how thou shalt act. When her companions see that her feather-suit is stolen, they will take flight and leave her to thee, and beware lest thou show thyself to them, but wait till they have flown away and she despaireth of them: whereupon do thou go in to her and hale her by the hair of her head[FN#68] and drag her to thee; which being done, she will be at thy mercy. And I rede thee discover not to her that thou hast taken the feather-suit, but keep it with care; for, so long as thou hast it in hold, she is thy prisoner and in thy power, seeing that she cannot fly to her country save with it. And lastly carry her down to thy chamber where she will be thine."" When Hasan heard her words his heart became at ease, his trouble ceased and affliction left him; so he rose to his feet and kissing his sister's head, went down from the terrace with her into the palace, where they slept that night. He medicined himself till morning morrowed; and when the sun rose, he sprang up and opened the staircase-door and ascending to the flat roof sat there till supper-tide when his sister brought him up somewhat of meat and drink and a change of clothes and he slept. And thus they continued doing, day by day until the end of the month. When he saw the new moon, he rejoiced and began to watch for the birds, and while he was thus, behold, up they came, like lightning. As soon as he espied them, he hid himself where he could watch them, unwatched by them, and they lighted down one and all of them, and putting off their clothes, descended into the basin. All this took place near the stead where Hasan lay concealed, and as soon as he caught sight of the girl he loved, he arose and crept under cover, little by little, towards the dresses, and Allah veiled him so that none marked his approach for they were laughing and playing with one another, till he laid hand on the dress. Now when they had made an end of their diversion, they came forth of the basin and each of them slipped on her feather-suit. But the damsel he loved sought for her plumage that she might put it on, but found it not; whereupon she shrieked and beat her cheeks and rent her raiment. Her sisterhood[FN#69] came to her and asked what ailed her, and she told them that her feather-suit was missing; wherefore they wept and shrieked and buffeted their faces: and they were confounded, wotting not the cause of this, and knew not what to do. Presently the night overtook them and they feared to abide with her lest that which had befallen her should befal them also; so they farewelled her and flying away left her alone upon the terrace-roof of the palace, by the pavilion basin.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had carried off the girl's plumery, she sought it but found it not and her sisterhood flew away leaving her alone. When they were out of sight, Hasan gave ear to her and heard her say, ""O who hast taken my dress and stripped me, I beseech thee to restore it to me and cover my shame, so may Allah never make thee taste of my tribulation!"" But when Hasan heard her speak thus, with speech sweeter than syrup, his love for her redoubled, passion got the mastery of his reason and he had not patience to endure from her. So springing up from his hiding-place, he rushed upon her and laying hold of her by the hair dragged her to him and carried her down to the basement of the palace and set her in his own chamber, where he threw over her a silken cloak[FN#70] and left her weeping and biting her hands. Then he shut the door upon her and going to his sister, informed her how he had made prize of his lover and carried her to his sleeping-closet, ""And there,"" quoth he, ""she is now sitting, weeping and biting her hands."" When his sister heard this, she rose forthright and betook herself to the chamber, where she found the captive weeping and mourning. So she kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam and the young lady said to her, ""O King's daughter, do folk like you do such foul deed with the daughters of Kings? Thou knowest that my father is a mighty Sovran and that all the liege lords of the Jinn stand in awe of him and fear his majesty: for that there are with him magicians and sages and Cohens and Satans and Marids, such as none may cope withal, and under his hand are folk whose number none knoweth save Allah. How then doth it become you, O daughters of Kings, to harbour mortal men with you and disclose to them our case and yours? Else how should this man, a stranger, come at us?"" Hasan's sister made reply, ""O King's daughter, in very sooth this human is perfect in nobleness and purposeth thee no villainy; but he loveth thee, and women were not made save for men. Did he not love thee, he had not fallen sick for thy sake and well-nigh given up the ghost for desire of thee."" And she told her the whole tale how Hasan had seen her bathing in the basin with her attendants, and fallen in love with her, and none had pleased him but she, for the rest were all her handmaids, and none had availed to put forth a hand to her. When the Princess heard this, she despaired of deliverance and presently Hasan's sister went forth and brought her a costly dress, wherein she robed her. Then she set before her somewhat of meat and drink and ate with her and heartened her heart and soothed her sorrows. And she ceased not to speak her fair with soft and pleasant words, saying, ""Have pity on him who saw thee once and became as one slain by thy love;"" and continued to console her and caress her, quoting fair says and pleasant instances. But she wept till daybreak, when her trouble subsided and she left shedding tears, knowing that she had fallen into the net and that there was no deliverance for her. Then said she to Hasan's sister, ""O King's daughter, with this my strangerhood and severance from my country and sisterhood which Allah wrote upon my brow, patience becometh me to support what my Lord hath foreordained."" Therewith the youngest Princess assigned her a chamber in the palace, than which there was none goodlier and ceased not to sit with her and console her and solace her heart, till she was satisfied with her lot and her bosom was broadened and she laughed and there ceased from her what trouble and oppression possessed her, by reason of her separation from her people and country and sisterhood and parents. Thereupon Hasan's sister repaired to him, and said, ""Arise, go in to her in her chamber and kiss her hands and feet.""[FN#71] So he went in to her and did this and bussed her between the eyes, saying, ""O Princess of fair ones and life of sprites and beholder's delight, be easy of heart, for I took thee only that I might be thy bondsman till the Day of Doom, and this my sister will be thy servant; for I, O my lady, desire naught but to take thee to wife, after the law of Allah and the practice of His Apostle, and whenas thou wilt, I will journey with thee to my country and carry thee to Baghdad-city and abide with thee there: moreover, I will buy thee handmaidens and negro chattels; and I have a mother, of the best of women, who will do thee service. There is no goodlier land than our land; everything therein is better than elsewhere and its folk are a pleasant people and bright of face."" Now as he bespake her thus and strave to comfort her, what while she answered him not a syllable, lo! there came a knocking at the palace-gate. So Hasan went out to see who was at the door and found there the six Princesses, who had returned from hunting and birding, whereat he rejoiced and went to meet them and welcomed them. They wished him safety and health and he wished them the like; after which they dismounted and going each to her chamber doffed their soiled clothes and donned fine linen. Then they came forth and demanded the game, for they had taken a store of gazelles and wild cows, hares and lions, hyaenas, and others; so their suite brought out some thereof for butchering, keeping the rest by them in the palace, and Hasan girt himself and fell to slaughtering for them in due form,[FN#72] whilst they sported and made merry, joying with great joy to see him standing amongst them hale and hearty once more. When they had made an end of slaughtering, they sat down and addressed themselves to get ready somewhat for breaking their fast, and Hasan, coming up to the eldest Princess, kissed her head and on like wise did he with the rest, one after other. Whereupon said they to him, ""Indeed, thou humblest thyself to us passing measure, O our brother, and we marvel at the excess of the affection thou showest us. But Allah forfend that thou shouldst do this thing, which it behoveth us rather to do with thee, seeing thou art a man and therefor worthier than we, who are of the Jinn.""[FN#73] Thereupon his eyes brimmed with tears and he wept sore; so they said to him, ""What causeth thee to weep? Indeed, thou troublest our pleasant lives with thy weeping this day. 'Twould seem thou longest after thy mother and native land. An things be so, we will equip thee and carry thee to thy home and thy friends."" He replied, ""By Allah, I desire not to part from you!"" Then they asked, ""Which of us hath vexed thee, that thou art thus troubled?"" But he was ashamed to say, ""Naught troubleth me save love of a damsel,"" lest they should deny and disavow him: so he was silent and would tell them nothing of his case. Then his sister came forward and said to them, ""He hath caught a bird from the air and would have you help him to tame her."" Whereupon they all turned to him and cried, ""We are at thy service every one of us and whatsoever thou seekest that will we do: but tell us thy tale and conceal from us naught of thy case."" So he said to his sister, ""Do thou tell them, for I am ashamed before them nor can I face them with these words.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan said to his sister, ""Do thou tell them my tale, for before them I stand abashed nor can I face them with these words."" So she said to them, ""O my sisters, when we went away and left alone this unhappy one, the palace was straitened upon him and he feared lest some one should come in to him, for ye know that the sons of Adam are light of wits. So, he opened the door of the staircase leading to the roof, of his loneliness and trouble, and sat there, looking upon the Wady and watching the gate, in his fear lest any should come thither. One day, as he sat thus, suddenly he saw ten birds approach him, making for the palace, and they lighted down on the brink of the basin which is in the pavilion-terrace. He watched these birds and saw, amongst them, one goodlier than the rest, which pecked the others and flouted them, whilst none of them dared put out a claw to it. Presently, they set their nails to their neck-collars and, rending their feather-suits, came forth therefrom and became damsels, each and every, like the moon on fullest night. Then they doffed their dress and plunging into the water, fell to playing with one another, whilst the chief damsel ducked the others, who dared not lay a finger on her and she was fairest of favour and most famous of form and most feateous of finery. They ceased not to be in this case till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when they came forth of the basin and, donning their feather-shifts, flew away home. Thereupon he waxed distracted, with a heart afire for love of the chief damsel and repenting him that he had not stolen her plumery. Wherefore he fell sick and abode on the palace-roof expecting her return and abstaining from meat and drink and sleep, and he ceased not to be so till the new moon showed, when behold, they again made their appearance according to custom and doffing their dresses went down into the basin. So he stole the chief damsel's feather-suit, knowing that she could not fly save therewith, hiding himself carefully lest they sight him and slay him. Then he waited till the rest had flown away, when he arose and seizing the damsel, carried her down from the terrace into the castle."" Her sisters asked, ""Where is she?""; and she answered, ""She is with him in such a chamber."" Quoth they, ""Describe her to us, O our sister:"" so quoth she, ""She is fairer than the moon on the night of fullness and her face is sheenier than the sun; the dew of her lips is sweeter than honey and her shape is straighter and slenderer than the cane; one with eyes black as night and brow flower-white; a bosom jewel-bright, breasts like pomegranates twain and cheeks like apples twain, a waist with dimples overlain, a navel like a casket of ivory full of musk in grain, and legs like columns of alabastrine vein. She ravisheth all hearts with Nature-kohl'd eyne, and a waist slender-fine and hips of heaviest design and speech that heals all pain and pine: she is goodly of shape and sweet of smile, as she were the moon in fullest sheen and shine."" When the Princesses heard these praises, they turned to Hasan and said to him, ""Show her to us."" So he arose with them, all love-distraught, and carrying them to the chamber wherein was the captive damsel, opened the door and entered, preceding the seven Princesses. Now when they saw her and noted her loveliness, they kissed the ground between her hands, marvelling at the fairness of her favour and the significance which showed her inner gifts, and said to her, ""By Allah, O daughter of the Sovran Supreme, this is indeed a mighty matter: and haddest thou heard tell of this mortal among women thou haddest marvelled at him all thy days. Indeed, he loveth thee with passionate love; yet, O King's daughter, he seeketh not lewdness, but desireth thee only in the way of lawful wedlock. Had we known that maids can do without men, we had impeached him from his intent, albeit he sent thee no messenger, but came to thee in person; and he telleth us he hath burnt the feather dress; else had we taken it from him."" Then one of them agreed with the Princess and becoming her deputy in the matter of the wedding contract, performed the marriage ceremony between them, whilst Hasan clapped palms with her, laying his hand in hers, and she wedded him to the damsel by consent; after which they celebrated her bridal feast, as beseemeth Kings' daughters, and brought Hasan in to her. So he rose and rent the veil and oped the gate and pierced the forge[FN#74] and brake the seal, whereupon affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love and longing for her. Then, since he had gotten that which he sought, he gave himself joy and improvised these couplets,

""Thy shape's temptation, eyes as Houri's fain * And sheddeth
       &nbsp     Beauty's sheen[FN#75] that radiance rare:
My glance portrayed thy glorious portraiture: * Rubies one-half
       &nbsp     and gems the third part were:
Musk made a fifth: a sixth was ambergris * The sixth a pearl but
       &nbsp     pearl without compare.
Eve never bare a daughter evening thee * Nor breathes thy like in
       &nbsp    Khuld's[FN#76] celestial air.
An thou would torture me 'tis wont of Love * And if thou pardon
       &nbsp     'tis thy choice I swear:
Then, O world bright'ner and O end of wish! * Loss of thy charms
       &nbsp     who could in patience bear?""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-second Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan went in unto the King's daughter and did away her maidenhead, he enjoyed her with exceeding joy and affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love-longing for her; so he recited the lines aforesaid. Now the Princesses were standing at the door and when they heard his verses, they said to her, ""O King's daughter, hearest thou the words of this mortal? How canst thou blame us, seeing that he maketh poetry for love of thee and indeed he hath so done a thousand times.""[FN#77] When she heard this she rejoiced and was glad and felt happy and Hasan abode with her forty[FN#78] days in all solace and delight, joyance and happiest plight, whilst the damsels renewed festivities for him every day and overwhelmed him with bounty and presents and rarities; and the King's daughter became reconciled to her sojourn amongst them and forgot her kith and kin. At the end of the forty days, Hasan saw in a dream, one night, his mother mourning for him and indeed her bones were wasted and her body had waxed shrunken and her complexion had yellowed and her favour had changed the while he was in excellent case. When she saw him in this state, she said to him, ""O my son, O Hasan, how is it that thou livest thy worldly life at thine ease and forgettest me? Look at my plight since thy loss! I do not forget thee, nor will my tongue cease to name thy name till I die; and I have made thee a tomb in my house, that I may never forget thee. Would Heaven I knew[FN#79] if I shall live, O my son, to see thee by my side and if we shall ever again foregather as we were."" Thereupon Hasan awoke from sleep, weeping and wailing, the tears railed down his cheeks like rain and he became mournful and melancholy; his tears dried not nor did sleep visit him, but he had no rest, and no patience was left to him. When he arose, the Princesses came in to him and gave him good-morrow and made merry with him as was their wont; but he paid no heed to them; so they asked his wife concerning his case and she said, ""I ken not."" Quoth they, ""Question him of his condition."" So she went up to him and said, ""What aileth thee, O my lord?"" Whereupon he moaned and groaned and told her what he had seen in his dream and repeated these two couplets,

""Indeed afflicted sore are we and all distraught, * Seeking for
       &nbsp    union; yet we find no way:
And Love's calamities upon us grow * And Love though light with
       &nbsp    heaviest weight doth weigh.""

His wife repeated to the Princesses what he said and they, hearing the verses, had pity on him and said to him, ""In Allah's name, do as thou wilt, for we may not hinder thee from visiting thy mother; nay, we will help thee to thy wish by what means we may. But it behoveth that thou desert us not, but visit us, though it be only once a year."" And he answered, ""To hear is to obey: be your behest on my head and eyes!"" Then they arose forthright and making him ready victual for the voyage, equipped the bride for him with raiment and ornaments and everything of price, such as defy description, and they bestowed on him gifts and presents which pens of ready writers lack power to set forth. Then they beat the magical kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries from all sides. They chose of them such as could carry all the gear they had prepared; amongst the rest five-and-twenty chests of gold and fifty of silver; and, mounting Hasan and his bride on others, rode with them three days, wherein they accomplished a march of three months. Then they bade them farewell and addressed themselves to return; whereupon his sister, the youngest damsel, threw herself on Hasan's neck and wept till she fainted. When she came to herself, she repeated these two couplets,

""Ne'er dawn the severance-day on any wise * That robs of sleep
       &nbsp     these heavy-lidded eyes.
From us and thee it hath fair union torn * It wastes our force
       &nbsp    and makes our forms its prize.""

Her verses finished she farewelled him, straitly charging him, whenas he should have come to his native land and have foregathered with his mother and set his heart at ease, to fail not of visiting her once in every six months and saying, ""If aught grieve thee or thou fear aught of vexation, beat the Magian's kettle-drum, whereupon the dromedaries shall come to thee; and do thou mount and return to us and persist not in staying away."" He swore thus to do and conjured them to go home. So they returned to the palace, mourning for their separation from him, especially the youngest, with whom no rest would stay nor would Patience her call obey, but she wept night and day. Thus it was with them; but as regards Hasan and his wife, they fared on by day and night over plain and desert site and valley and stony heights through noon-tide glare and dawn's soft light; and Allah decreed them safety, so that they reached Bassorah-city without hindrance and made their camels kneel at the door of his house. Hasan then dismissed the dromedaries and, going up to the door to open it, heard his mother weeping and in a faint strain, from a heart worn with parting-pain and on fire with consuming bane, reciting these couplets,

""How shall he taste of sleep who lacks repose * Who wakes a-night
       &nbsp   when all in slumber wone?
He owned wealth and family and fame * Yet fared from house and
       &nbsp  home an exile lone:
Live coal beneath his[FN#80] ribs he bears for bane, * And mighty
       &nbsp  longing, mightier ne'er was known:
Passion hath seized him, Passion mastered him; * Yet is he
       &nbsp   constant while he maketh moan:
His case for Love proclaimeth aye that he, * (As prove his tears)
       &nbsp   is wretched, woebegone.""

When Hasan heard his mother weeping and wailing he wept also and knocked at the door a loud knock. Quoth she, ""Who is at the door?""; and quoth he, ""Open!"" Whereupon she opened the door and knowing him at first sight fell down in a fainting fit; but he ceased not to tend her till she came to herself, when he embraced her and she embraced him and kissed him, whilst his wife looked on mother and son. Then he carried his goods and gear into the house, whilst his mother, for that her heart was comforted and Allah had reunited her with her son versified with these couplets,

""Fortune had ruth upon my plight * Pitied my long long bane and
       &nbsp    blight;
Gave me what I would liefest sight; * And set me free from all
       &nbsp    afright.
So pardon I the sin that sin * nèd she in days evanisht quite;
E'en to the sin she sinned when she * Bleached my hair-parting
       &nbsp     silvern white.""

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-third Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his mother then sat talking and she asked him, ""How faredst thou, O my son, with the Persian?"" whereto he answered, ""O my mother, he was no Persian, but a Magian, who worshipped the fire, not the All-powerful Sire."" Then he told her how he dealt with him, in that he had journeyed with him to the Mountain of Clouds and sewed him up in the camel's skin, and how the vultures had taken him up and set him down on the summit and what he had seen there of dead folk, whom the Magian had deluded and left to die on the crest after they had done his desire. And he told her how he had cast himself from the mountain-top into the sea and Allah the Most High had preserved him and brought him to the palace of the seven Princesses and how the youngest of them had taken him to brother and he had sojourned with them till the Almighty brought the Magian to the place where he was and he slew him. Moreover, he told her of his passion for the King's daughter and how he had made prize of her and of his seeing her[FN#81] in sleep and all else that had befallen him up to the time when Allah vouchsafed them reunion. She wondered at his story and praised the Lord who had restored him to her in health and safety. Then she arose and examined the baggage and loads and questioned him of them. So he told her what was in them, whereat she joyed with exceeding joy. Then she went up to the King's daughter, to talk with her and bear her company; but, when her eyes fell on her, her wits were confounded at her brilliancy and she rejoiced and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace: and she sat down beside her, cheering her and comforting her heart while she never ceased to repeat ""Alhamdolillah, O my son, for thy return to me safe and sound!"" Next morning early she went down into the market and bought mighty fine furniture and ten suits of the richest raiment in the city, and clad the young wife and adorned her with everything seemiy. Then said she to Hasan, ""O my son, we cannot tarry in this town with all this wealth; for thou knowest that we are poor folk and the people will suspect us of practising alchemy. So come, let us depart to Baghdad, the House[FN#82] of Peace, where we may dwell in the Caliph's Sanctuary, and thou shalt sit in a shop to buy and sell, in the fear of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) and He shall open to thee the door of blessings with this wealth."" Hasan approved her counsel and going forth straightway, sold the house and summoned the dromedaries, which he loaded with all his goods and gear, together with his mother and wife. Then he went down to the Tigris, where he hired him a craft to carry them to Baghdad and embarked therein all his possessions and his mother and wife. They sailed up the river with a fair wind for ten days till they drew in sight of Baghdad, at which they all rejoiced, and the ship landed them in the city, where without stay or delay Hasan hired a storehouse in one of the caravanserais and transported his goods thither. He lodged that night in the Khan, and on the morrow he changed his clothes and going down into the city, enquired for a broker. The folk directed him to one, and when the broker saw him, he asked him what he lacked. Quoth he, ""I want a house, a handsome one and a spacious."" So the broker showed him the houses at his disposal and he chose one that belonged to one of the Wazirs and buying it of him for an hundred thousand golden dinars, gave him the price. Then he returned to his caravanserai and removed all his goods and monies to the house; after which he went down to the market and bought all the mansion needed of vessels and carpets and other household stuff, besides servants and eunuchs, including a little black boy for the house. He abode with his wife in all solace and delight of life three years, during which time he was vouchsafed by her two sons, one of whom he named Násir and the other Mansúr: but, at the end of this time he bethought him of his sisters, the Princesses, and called to mind all their goodness to him and how they had helped him to his desire. So he longed after them and going out to the marketstreets of the city, bought trinkets and costly stuffs and fruit-confections, such as they had never seen or known. His mother asked him the reason of his buying these rarities and he answered, ""I purpose to visit my sisters, who showed me every kind of kindness and all the wealth that I at present enjoy is due to their goodness and munificence: wherefore I will journey to them and return soon, Inshallah!"" Quoth she, ""O my son, be not long absent from me;"" and quoth he, ""Know, O my mother, how thou shalt do with my wife. Here is her feather-dress in a chest, buried under ground in such a place; do thou watch over it, lest haply she hap on it and take it, for she would fly away, she and her children, and I should never hear of them again and should die of grieving for them; wherefore take heed, O my mother, while I warn thee that thou name this not to her. Thou must know that she is the daughter of a King of the Jinn, than whom there is not a greater among the Sovrans of the Jann nor a richer in troops and treasure, and she is mistress of her people and dearest to her father of all he hath. Moreover, she is passing high-spirited, so do thou serve her thyself and suffer her not to go forth the door neither look out of window nor over the wall, for I fear the air for her when it bloweth,[FN#83] and if aught befel her of the calamities of this world, I should slay myself for her sake."" She replied, ""O my son, I take refuge with Allah[FN#84] from gainsaying thee! Am I mad that thou shouldst lay this charge on me and I disobey thee therein? Depart, O my son, with heart at ease, and please Allah, soon thou shalt return in safety and see her and she shall tell thee how I have dealt with her: but tarry not, O my son, beyond the time of travel.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had determined to visit the Princesses, he gave his mother the orders we have mentioned.[FN#85] Now, as Fate would have it, his wife heard what he said to his mother and neither of them knew it. Then Hasan went without the city and beat the kettle-drum, whereupon up came the dromedaries and he loaded twenty of them with rarities of Al-Irak; after which he returned to his mother and repeated his charge to her and took leave of her and his wife and children, one of whom was a yearling babe and the other two years old. Then he mounted and fared on, without stopping night or day, over hills and valleys and plains and wastes for a term of ten days till, on the eleventh, he reached the palace and went in to his sisters, with the gifts he had brought them. The Princesses rejoiced at his sight and gave him joy of his safety, whilst his sister decorated the palace within and without. Then they took the presents and, lodging him in a chamber as before, asked him of his mother and his wife, and he told them that she had borne him two sons. And the youngest Princess, seeing him well and in good case, joyed with exceeding joy and repeated this couplet,

""I ever ask for news of you from whatso breezes pass * And never any but yourselves can pass across my mind.""

Then he abode with them in all honour and hospitality, for three months, spending his time in feasting and merrymaking, joy and delight, hunting and sporting. So fared it with him; but as regards his wife, she abode with his mother two days after her husband's departure, and on the third day, she said to her, ""Glory be to God! Have I lived with him three years and shall I never go to the bath?"" Then she wept and Hasan's mother had pity on her condition and said to her, ""O my daughter, here we are strangers and thy husband is abroad. Were he at home, he would serve thee himself, but, as for me, I know no one. However, O my daughter, I will heat thee water and wash thy head in the Hammam-bath which is in the house."" Answered the King's daughter, ""O my lady, hadst thou spoken thus to one of the slave-girls, she had demanded to be sold in the Sultan's open market and had not abode with thee.[FN#86] Men are excusable, because they are jealous and their reason telleth them that, if a woman go forth the house, haply she will do frowardness. But women, O my lady, are not all equal and alike and thou knowest that, if woman have a mind to aught, whether it be the Hammam or what not else, none hath power over her to guard her or keep her chaste or debar her from her desire; for she will do whatso she willeth and naught restraineth her but her reason and her religion.""[FN#87] Then she wept and cursed fate and bemoaned herself and her strangerhood, till Hasan's mother was moved to ruth for her case and knew that all she said was but truth and that there was nothing for it but to let her have her way. So she committed the affair to Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and making ready all that they needed for the bath, took her and went with her to the Hammam. She carried her two little sons with her, and when they entered, they put off their clothes and all the women fell to gazing on the Princess and glorifying God (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) for that He had created so fair a form. The women of the city, even those who were passing by, flocked to gaze upon her, and the report of her was noised abroad in Baghdad till the bath was crowded that there was no passing through it. Now it chanced there was present on that day and on that rare occasion with the rest of the women in the Hammam, one of the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, by name Tohfah[FN#88] the Lutanist, and she, finding the Hammam over crowded and no passing for the throng of women and girls, asked what was to do; and they told her of the young lady. So she walked up to her and, considering her closely, was amazed at her grace and loveliness and glorified God (magnified be His majesty!) for the fair forms He hath created. The sight hindered her from her bath, so that she went not farther in nor washed, but sat staring at the Princess, till she had made an end of bathing and coming forth of the caldarium donned her raiment, whereupon beauty was added to her beauty. She sat down on the divan,[FN#89] whilst the women gazed upon her; then she looked at them and veiling herself, went out. Tohfah went out with her and followed her, till she saw where she dwelt, when she left her and returned to the Caliph's palace; and ceased not wending till she went in to the Lady Zubaydah and kissed ground between her hands; whereupon quoth her mistress, ""O Tohfah, why hast thou tarried in the Hammam?"" She replied, ""O my lady, I have seen a marvel, never saw I its like amongst men or women, and this it was that distracted me and dazed my wit and amazed me, so that I forgot even to wash my head."" Asked Zubaydah, ""And what was that?"" ; and Tohfah answered, ""O my lady, I saw a damsel in the bath, having with her two little boys like moons, eye never espied her like, nor before her nor after her, neither is there the fellow of her form in the whole world nor her peer amongst Ajams or Turks or Arabs. By the munificence, O my lady, an thou toldest the Commander of the Faithful of her, he would slay her husband and take her from him, for her like is not to be found among women. I asked of her mate and they told me that he is a merchant Hasan of Bassorah hight. Moreover, I followed her from the bath to her own house and found it to be that of the Wazir, with the two gates, one opening on the river and the other on the land.[FN#90] Indeed, O my lady, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her husband and take love-liesse with her.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Tohfah, after seeing the King's daughter, described her beauty to the Lady Zubaydah ending with, ""Indeed, O my mistress, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her mate and take her to wife,"" Zubaydah cried, ""Woe to thee, O Tohfah, say me, doth this damsel display such passing beauty and loveliness that the Commander of the Faithful should, on her account, barter his soul's good for his worldly lust and break the Holy Law! By Allah, needs must I look on her, and if she be not as thou sayest, I will bid strike off thy head! O strumpet, there are in the Caliph's Serraglio three hundred and three score slave girls, after the number of the days of the year, yet is there none amongst them so excellent as thou describest!"" Tohfah replied, ""No, by Allah, O my lady!: nor is there her like in all Baghdad; no, nor amongst the Arabs or the Daylamites nor hath Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) created the like of her!"" Thereupon Zuhaydah called for Masrur, the eunuch, who came and kissed the ground before her, and she said to him, ""O Masrur, go to the Wazir's house, that with the two gates, one giving on the water and the other on the land, and bring me the damsel who dwelleth there, also her two children and the old woman who is with her, and haste thou and tarry not."" Said Masrur, ""I hear and I obey,"" and repairing to Hasan's house, knocked at the door. Quoth the old woman, ""Who is at the door?"" and quoth he, ""Masrur, the eunuch of the Commander of the Faithful."" So she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam; whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need; and he replied, ""The Lady Zubaydah, daughter of Al-Kasim[FN#91] and queen-spouse of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al-Rashid sixth[FN#92] of the sons of Al-Abbas, paternal uncle of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) summoneth thee to her, thee and thy son's wife and her children; for the women have told her anent her and her beauty."" Rejoined the old woman, ""O my lord Masrur, we are foreigner folk and the girl's husband (my son) who is abroad and far from home hath strictly charged me not to go forth nor let her go forth in his absence, neither show her to any of the creatures of Allah Almighty; and I fear me, if aught befal her and he come back, he will slay himself; wherefore of thy favour I beseech thee, O Masrur, require us not of that whereof we are unable."" Masrur retorted, ""O my lady, if I knew aught to be feared for you in this, I would not require you to go; the Lady Zubaydah desireth but to see her and then she may return. So disobey not or thou wilt repent; and like as I take you, I will bring you both back in safety, Inshallah!"" Hasan's mother could not gainsay him; so she went in and making the damsel ready, brought her and her children forth and they all followed Masrur to the palace of the Caliphate where he carried them in and seated them on the floor before the Lady Zubaydah. They kissed ground before her and called down blessings upon her; and Zubaydah said to the young lady (who was veiled), ""Wilt thou not uncover thy face, that I may look on it?"" So she kissed the ground between her hands and discovered a face which put to shame the full moon in the height of heaven. Zubaydah fixed her eyes on her and let their glances wander over her, whilst the palace was illumined by the light of her countenance; whereupon the Queen and the whole company were amazed at her beauty and all who looked on her became Jinn-mad and unable to bespeak one another. As for Zubaydah, she rose and making the damsel stand up, strained her to her bosom and seated her by herself on the couch. Moreover, she bade decorate the palace in her honour and calling for a suit of the richest raiment and a necklace of the rarest ornaments put them upon her. Then said she to her, ""O liege lady of fair ones, verily thou astoundest me and fillest mine eyes.[FN#93] What arts knowest thou?"" She replied, ""O my lady, I have a dress of feathers, and could I but put it on before thee, thou wouldst see one of the fairest of fashions and marvel thereat, and all who saw it would talk of its goodliness, generation after generation."" Zubaydah asked, ""And where is this dress of thine?""; and the damsel answered, ""'Tis with my husband's mother. Do thou seek it for me of her."" So Zubaydah said to the old woman, ""O my lady the pilgrimess, O my mother, go forth and fetch us her feather-dress, that we may solace ourselves by looking on what she will do, and after take it back again."" Replied the old woman, ""O my lady, this damsel is a liar. Hast thou ever seen any of womankind with a dress of feathers? Indeed, this belongeth only to birds."" But the damsel said to the Lady Zubaydah, ""As thou livest, O my lady, she hath a feather-dress of mine and it is in a chest, which is buried in such a store-closet in the house."" So Zubaydah took off her neck a rivière of jewels, worth all the treasures of Chosroe and Cæsar, and gave it to the old woman, saying, ""O my mother, I conjure thee by my life, take this necklace and go and fetch us this dress, that we may divert ourselves with the sight thereof, and after take it again!"" But she sware to her that she had never seen any such dress and wist not what the damsel meant by her speech. Then the Lady Zubaydah cried out at her and taking the key from her, called Masrur and said to him as soon as her came, ""Take this key and go to the house; then open it and enter a store-closet there whose door is such and such and amiddlemost of it thou wilt find a chest buried. Take it out and break it open and bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Lady Zubaydah, having taken the key from Hasan's mother, handed it to Masrur, saying, ""Take this key and open such a closet; then bring forth of it the chest; break it open; bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied he and taking the key went forth, whereupon the old woman arose and followed him, weeping-eyed and repenting her of having given ear to the damsel and gone with her to the bath, for her desire to go thither was but a device. So she went with him to the house and opened the door of the closet, and he entered and brought out the chest. Then he took therefrom the feather,dress and wrapping it in a napkin, carried it to the Lady Zubaydah, who took it and turned it about, marvelling at the beauty of its make; after which she gave it to the damsel, saying, ""Is this thy dress of feathers?"" She replied, ""Yes, O my lady,"" and at once putting forth her hand, took it joyfully. Then she examined it and rejoiced to find it whole as it was, not a feather gone. So she rose and came down from beside the Lady Zubaydah and taking her sons in her bosom, wrapped herself in the feather-dress and became a bird, by the ordinance of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!), whereat Zubaydah marvelled as did all who were present. Then she walked with a swaying and graceful gait and danced and sported and flapped her wings, whilst all eyes were fixed on her and all marvelled at what she did. Then said she with fluent tongue, ""Is this goodly, O my ladies?""; and they replied, ""Yes, O Princess of the fair! All thou dost is goodly."" Said she, ""And this, O my mistresses, that I am about to do is better yet."" Then she spread her wings and flying up with her children to the dome of the palace, perched on the saloon-roof whilst they all looked at her, wide-eyed and said, ""By Allah, this is indeed a rare and peregrine fashion! Never saw we its like."" Then, as she was about to take flight for her own land, she bethought her of Hasan and said, ""Hark ye, my mistresses!"" and she improvised these couplets,[FN#94]

""O who bast quitted these abodes and faredst lief and light * To
       &nbsp    other objects of thy love with fain and fastest flight!
Deem'st thou that 'bided I with you in solace and in joy * Or
       &nbsp    that my days amid you all were clear of bane and blight?
When I was captive ta'en of Love and snarèd in his snare, * He
       &nbsp    made of Love my prison and he fared fro' me forthright:
So when my fear was hidden, he made sure that ne'er should I *
       &nbsp     Pray to the One, th' Omnipotent to render me my right:
He charged his mother keep the secret with all the care she
       &nbsp     could, * In closet shut and treated me with enemy's
       &nbsp     despight:
But I o'erheard their words and held them fast in memory * And
       &nbsp   hoped for fortune fair and weal and blessings infinite:
My faring to the Hammam-bath then proved to me the means * Of
       &nbsp   making minds of folk to be confounded at my sight:
Wondered the Bride of Al-Rashid to see my brilliancy * When she
       &nbsp   beheld me right and left with all of beauty dight:
Then quoth I, 'O our Caliph's wife, I once was wont to own * A
       &nbsp   dress of feathers rich and rare that did the eyes delight:
An it were now on me thou shouldst indeed see wondrous things *
       &nbsp  That would efface all sorrows and disperse all sores of
       &nbsp   sprite:'
Then deigned our Caliph's Bride to cry, 'Where is that dress of
       &nbsp    thine?' * And I replied, 'In house of him kept darkling as
       &nbsp   the night.'
So down upon it pounced Masrúr and brought it unto her, * And
       &nbsp   when 'twas there each feather cast a ray of beaming light:
Therewith I took it from his hand and opened it straightway * And
       &nbsp    saw its plumèd bosom and its buttons pleased my sight:
And so I clad myself therein and took with me my babes; * And
       &nbsp     spread my wings and flew away with all my main and might;
Saying, 'O husband's mother mine tell him when cometh he * An
       &nbsp     ever wouldest meet her thou from house and home must flee.""'

When she had made an end of her verses, the Lady Zubaydah said to her, ""Wilt thou not come down to us, that we may take our fill of thy beauty, O fairest of the fair? Glory be to Him who hath given thee eloquence and brilliance!"" But she said, ""Far be from me that the Past return should see!"" Then said she to the mother of the hapless, wretched Hasan, ""By Allah, O my lady, O mother of my husband, it irketh me to part from thee; but, whenas thy son cometh to thee and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the islands of Wák[FN#95] to me."" Then she took flight with her children and sought her own country, whilst the old woman wept and beat her face and moaned and groaned till she swooned away. When she came to herself, she said to the Lady Zubaydah, ""O my lady, what is this thou hast done?"" And Zubaydah said to her, ""O my lady the pilgrimess, I knew not that this would happen and hadst thou told me of the case and acquainted me with her condition, I had not gainsaid thee. Nor did I know until now that she was of the Flying Jinn; else had I not suffered her to don the dress nor permitted her to take her children: but now, O my lady, words profit nothing; so do thou acquit me of offence against thee."" And the old woman could do no otherwise than shortly answer, ""Thou art acquitted.!"" Then she went forth the palace of the Caliphate and returned to her own house, where she buffeted her face till she swooned away, When she came to herself, she pined for her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren and for the sight of her son and versified with these couplets,

""Your faring on the parting-day drew many a tear fro' me, * Who
       &nbsp     must your flying from the home long mourn in misery:
And cried I for the parting pang in anguish likest fire * And
       &nbsp     tear-floods chafed mine eyelids sore that ne'er of tears
       &nbsp     were free;
'Yes, this is Severance, Ah, shall we e'er oy return of you? *
       &nbsp     For your departure hath deprived my power of privacy!'
Ah, would they had returned to me in covenant of faith * An they
       &nbsp     return perhaps restore of past these eyne may see.""

Then arising she dug in the house three graves and betook herself to them with weeping all whiles of the day and watches of the night; and when her son's absence was longsome upon her and grief and yearning and unquiet waxed upon her, she recited these couplets,

""Deep in mine eye-balls ever dwells the phantom-form of thee * My
       &nbsp     heart when throbbing or at rest holds fast thy memory:
And love of thee doth never cease to course within my breast, *
       &nbsp     As course the juices in the fruits which deck the branchy
       &nbsp     tree:
And every day I see thee not my bosom straightened is * And even
       &nbsp     censurers excuse the woes in me they see:
O thou whose love hath gotten hold the foremost in the heart * Of
       &nbsp     me whose fondness is excelled by mine insanity:
Fear the Compassionate in my case and some compassion show! *
       &nbsp     Love of thee makes me taste of death in bitterest pungency.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's mother bewept through the watches of the night and the whiles of the day her separation from her son and his wife and children. On this wise it fared with her; but as regards Hasan, when he came to the Princesses, they conjured him to tarry with them three months, after which long sojourn they gave him five loads of gold and the like of silver and one load of victual and accompanied him on his homeward way till he conjured them to return, whereupon they farewelled him with an embrace; but the youngest came up to him, to bid him adieu and clasping his neck wept till she fainted. Then she recited these two couplets,

""When shall the severance-fire be quenched by union, love, with
       &nbsp     you? * When shall I win my wish of you and days that were
       &nbsp     renew?
The parting-day affrighted me and wrought me dire dismay * And
       &nbsp     doubleth woe, O master mine, by the sad word 'Adieu.'""

Anon came forward the second Princess and embraced him and recited these two couplets,

""Farewelling thee indeed is like to bidding life farewell * And
       &nbsp     like the loss of Zephyr[FN#96] 'tis to lose thee far our
       &nbsp    sight:
Thine absence is a flaming fire which burneth up my heart * And
       &nbsp   in thy presence I enjoy the Gardens of Delight.""[FN#97]

Presently came forward the third and embraced him and recited these two couplets,

""We left not taking leave of thee (when bound to other goal) *
       &nbsp   From aught of ill intention or from weariness and dole:
Thou art my soul, my very soul, the only soul of me: * And how
       &nbsp    shall I farewell myself and say, 'Adieu my Soul?'""[FN#98]

After her came forward the fourth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,

""Nought garred me weep save where and when of severance spake he,
       &nbsp    * Persisting in his cruel will with sore persistency:
Look at this pearl-like ornament I've hung upon mine ear: * 'Tis
       &nbsp     of the tears of me compact, this choicest jewelry!""

In her turn came forward the fifth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,

""Ah, fare thee not; for I've no force thy faring to endure, * Nor
       &nbsp     e'en to say the word farewell before my friend is sped:
Nor any patience to support the days of severance, * Nor any
       &nbsp   tears on ruined house and wasted home to shed.""

Next came the sixth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,

""I cried, as the camels went off with them, * And Love pained my
       &nbsp    vitals with sorest pain:
Had I a King who would lend me rule * I'd seize every ship that
       &nbsp    dares sail the Main.""

Lastly came forward the seventh and embraced him and recited these couplets,

""When thou seest parting, be patient still, * Nor let foreign
       &nbsp     parts deal thy soul affright:
But abide, expecting a swift return, * For all hearts hold
       &nbsp     parting in sore despight.""

And eke these two couplets,

""Indeed I'm heartbroken to see thee start, * Nor can I farewell
       &nbsp     thee ere thou depart;
Allah wotteth I left not to say adieu * Save for fear that saying
       &nbsp     would melt your heart.""

Hasan also wept for parting from them, till he swooned, and repeated these couplets,

""Indeed, ran my tears on the severance-day * Like pearls I
       &nbsp     threaded in necklace-way
The cameleer drove his camels with song * But I lost heart,
       &nbsp    patience and strength and stay:
I bade them farewell and retired in grief * From tryst-place and
       &nbsp     camp where my dearlings lay:
I turned me unknowing the way nor joyed * My soul, but in hopes
       &nbsp     to return some day.
Oh listen, my friend, to the words of love * God forbid thy heart
       &nbsp     forget all I say!
O my soul when thou partest wi' them, part too * With all joys of
       &nbsp     life nor for living pray!""

Then he farewelled them and fared on diligently night and day, till he came to Baghdad, the House of Peace and Sanctuary of the Abbaside Caliphs, unknowing what had passed during his wayfare. At once entering his house he went in to his mother to salute her, but found her worn of body and wasted of bones, for excess of mourning and watching, weeping and wailing, till she was grown thin as a toothpick and could not answer him a word. So he dismissed the dromedaries then asked her of his wife and children and she wept till she fainted, and he seeing her in this state searched the house for them, but found no trace of them. Then he went to the store-closet and finding it open and the chest broken and the feather-dress missing, knew forthright that his wife had possessed herself thereof and flown away with her children. Then he returned to his mother and, finding her recovered from her fit, questioned her of his spouse and babes, whereupon she wept and said, ""O my son, may Allah amply requite thee their loss! These are their three tombs.""[FN#99] When Hasan heard these words of his mother, he shrieked a loud shriek and fell down in a fainting-fit in which he lay from the first of the day till noon-tide; whereupon anguish was added to his mother's anguish and she despaired of his life. However, after a-while, he came to himself and wept and buffeted his face and rent his raiment and went about the house clean distraught, reciting these two couplets,[FN#100]

""Folk have made moan of passion before me, of past years, * And
live and dead for absence have suffered pains and fears;
But that within my bosom I harbour, with mine eyes * I've never
seen the like of nor heard with mine ears.""
Then finishing his verses he bared his brand and coming up to his mother, said to her, ""Except thou tell me the truth of the case, I will strike off thy head and kill myself."" She replied, ""O my son, do not such deed: put up thy sword and sit down, till I tell thee what hath passed."" So he sheathed his scymitar and sat by her side, whilst she recounted to him all that had happened in his absence from first to last, adding, ""O my son, but that I saw her weep in her longing for the bath and feared that she would go and complain to thee on thy return, and thou wouldst be wroth with me. I had never carried her thither; and were it not that the Lady Zubaydah was wroth with me and took the key from me by force, I had never brought out the feather-dress, though I died for it. But thou knowest, O my son, that no hand may measure length with that of the Caliphate. When they brought her the dress, she took it and turned it over, fancying that somewhat might be lost thereof, but she found it uninjured; wherefore she rejoiced and making her children fast to her waist, donned the feather-vest, after the Lady Zubaydah had pulled off to her all that was upon herself and clad her therein, in honour of her and because of her beauty. No sooner had she donned the dress than she shook and becoming a bird, promenaded about the palace, whilst all who were present gazed at her and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness. Then she flew up to the palace roof and perching thereon, looked at me and said: 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of separation upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him leave his native land and journey to the Islands of Wak and seek me.' This, then, is her story and what befel in thine absence.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Hasan's mother had made an end of her story, he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which continued till the end of day, when he revived and fell to buffeting his face and writhing on the floor like a scotched snake. His mother sat weeping by his head until midnight, when he came to himself and wept sore and recited these couplets',[FN#101]

""Pause ye and see his sorry state since when ye fain withdrew; *
       &nbsp    Haply, when wrought your cruelty, you'll have the grace to
       &nbsp    rue:
For an ye look on him, you'll doubt of him by sickness-stress *
       &nbsp    As though, by Allah, he were one before ye never knew.
He dies for nothing save for love of you, and he would be *
       &nbsp    Numbered amid the dead did not he moan and groan for you.
And deem not pangs of severance sit all lightly on his soul; *
       &nbsp    'Tis heavy load on lover-wight; 'twere lighter an ye slew.""

Then having ended his verse he rose and went round about the house, weeping and wailing, groaning and bemoaning himself, five days, during which he tasted nor meat nor drink. His mother came to him and conjured him, till he broke his fast, and besought him to leave weeping; but he hearkened not to her and continued to shed tears and lament, whilst she strove to comfort him and he heeded her not. Then he recited these couplets,[FN#102]

""Beareth for love a burden sore this soul of me, * Could break a
       &nbsp     mortal's back however strong that be;
I am distraught to see my case and languor grows * Making my day
       &nbsp   and night indifferent in degree:
I own to having dreaded Death before this day: * This day I hold
       &nbsp   my death mine only remedy.""

And Hasan ceased not to do thus till daybreak, when his eyes closed and he saw in a dream his wife grief-full and repentant for that which she had done. So he started up from sleep crying out and reciting these two couplets,

""Their image bides with me, ne'er quits me, ne'er shall fly; *
       &nbsp    But holds within my heart most honourable stead;
But for reunion-hope, I'd see me die forthright, * And but for
       &nbsp     phantom-form of thee my sleep had fled.""

And as morning morrowed he redoubled his lamentations. He abode weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted, wakeful by night and eating little, for a whole month, at the end of which he bethought him to repair to his sisters and take counsel with them in the matter of his wife, so haply they might help him to regain her. Accordingly he summoned the dromedaries and loading fifty of them with rarities of Al-Irak, committed the house to his mother's care and deposited all his goods in safe keeping, except some few he left at home. Then he mounted one of the beasts and set out on his journey single handed, intent upon obtaining aidance from the Princesses, and he stayed not till he reached the Palace of the Mountain of Clouds, when he went in to the damsels and gave them the presents in which they rejoiced. Then they wished him joy of his safety and said to him, ""O our brother, what can ail thee to come again so soon, seeing thou wast with us but two months since?"" Whereupon he wept and improvised these couplets,

""My soul for loss of lover sped I sight; * Nor life enjoying
       &nbsp    neither life's delight:
My case is one whose cure is all unknown; * Can any cure the sick
       &nbsp    but doctor wight?
O who hast reft my sleep-joys, leaving me * To ask the breeze
       &nbsp    that blew from that fair site,—
Blew from my lover's land (the land that owns * Those charms so
       &nbsp    sore a grief in soul excite),
'O breeze, that visitest her land, perhaps * Breathing her scent,
       &nbsp   thou mayst revive my sprite!'""

And when he ended his verse he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting-fit. The Princesses sat round him, weeping over him, till he recovered and repeated these two couplets,

""Haply and happily may Fortune bend her rein * Bringing my love,
       &nbsp    for Time's a freke of jealous strain;[FN#103]
Fortune may prosper me, supply mine every want, * And bring a
       &nbsp    blessing where before were ban and bane.""

Then he wept till he fainted again, and presently coming to himself recited the two following couplets,

""My wish, mine illness, mine unease! by Allah, own * Art thou
       &nbsp   content? then I in love contented wone!
Dost thou forsake me thus sans crime or sin * Meet me in ruth, I
       &nbsp    pray, and be our parting gone.""

Then he wept till he swooned away once more and when he revived he repeated these couplets,

""Sleep fled me, by my side wake ever shows * And hoard of
       &nbsp     tear-drops from these eyne aye flows;
For love they weep with beads cornelian-like * And growth of
       &nbsp     distance greater dolence grows:
Lit up my longing, O my love, in me * Flames burning 'neath my
       &nbsp     ribs with fiery throes!
Remembering thee a tear I never shed * But in it thunder roars
       &nbsp     and leven glows.""

Then he wept till he fainted away a fourth time, and presently recovering, recited these couplets,

""Ah! for lowe of love and longing suffer ye as suffer we? * Say,
       &nbsp    as pine we and as yearn we for you are pining ye?
Allah do the death of Love, what a bitter draught is his! * Would
       &nbsp    I wot of Love what plans and what projects nurseth he!
Your faces radiant-fair though afar from me they shine, * Are
       &nbsp   mirrored in our eyes whatsoever the distance be;
My heart must ever dwell on the memories of your tribe; * And the
       &nbsp   turtle-dove reneweth all as oft as moaneth she:
Ho thou dove, who passest night-tide in calling on thy fere, *
       &nbsp    Thou doublest my repine, bringing grief for company;
And leavest thou mine eyelids with weeping unfulfilled * For the
       &nbsp     dearlings who departed, whom we never more may see:
I melt for the thought of you at every time and hour, * And I
       &nbsp     long for you when Night showeth cheek of blackest blee.""

Now when his sister heard these words and saw his condition and how he lay fainting on the floor, she screamed and beat her face and the other Princesses hearing her scream came out and learning his misfortune and the transport of love and longing and the passion and distraction that possessed him they questioned him of his case. He wept and told them what had befallen in his absence and how his wife had taken flight with her children, wherefore they grieved for him and asked him what she said at leave-taking. Answered he, ""O my sisters, she said to my mother, 'Tell thy son, whenas he cometh to thee and the nights of sever- ance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see, and whenas the winds of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him fare in the Islands of Wak to me."" When they heard his words they signed one to other with their eyes and shook their heads, and each looked at her sister, whilst Hasan looked at them all. Then they bowed their heads groundwards and bethought themselves awhile; after which they raised their heads and said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; presently adding, ""Put forth thy hand to heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to thy wife.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Princesses said to Hasan, ""Put forth thy hand to Heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to wife and children,"" thereat the tears ran down his cheeks like rain and wet his clothes, and he recited these couplets,

""Pink cheeks and eyes enpupil'd black have dealt me sore
       &nbsp  despight; * And whenas wake overpowered sleep my patience
       &nbsp   fled in fright:
The fair and sleek-limbed maidens hard of heart withal laid waste
       &nbsp  * My very bones till not a breath is left for man to sight:
Houris, who fare with gait of grace as roes o'er sandy-mound: *
       &nbsp    Did Allah's saints behold their charms they'd doat thereon
       &nbsp    forthright;
Faring as fares the garden breeze that bloweth in the dawn. * For
       &nbsp   love of them a sore unrest and troubles rack my sprite:
I hung my hopes upon a maid, a loveling fair of them, * For whom
       &nbsp    my heart still burns with lowe in Lazá-hell they light;—
A       &nbsp dearling soft of sides and haught and graceful in her gait, *
Her grace is white as morning, but her hair is black as
       &nbsp    night:
She stirreth me! But ah, how many heroes have her cheeks *
       &nbsp    Upstirred for love, and eke her eyes that mingle black and
       &nbsp    white.""

Then he wept, whilst the Princesses wept for his weeping, and they were moved to compassion and jealousy for him. So they fell to comforting him and exhorting him to patience and offering up prayers for his reunion with his wife; whilst his sister said to him, ""O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and be patient; so shalt thou win thy will; for whoso hath patience and waiteth, that he seeketh attaineth. Patience holdeth the keys of relief and indeed the poet saith,

'Let destiny with slackened rein its course appointed fare! And
       &nbsp    lie thou down to sleep by night, with heart devoid of care;
For 'twixt the closing of an eye and th' opening thereof, God
       &nbsp     hath it in His power to change a case from foul to
       &nbsp   fair.""[FN#104]

So hearten thy heart and brace up thy resolve, for the son of ten years dieth not in the ninth.[FN#105] Weeping and grief and mourning gender sickness and disease; wherefore do thou abide with us till thou be rested, and I will devise some device for thy winning to thy wife and children, Inshallah—so it please Allah the Most High!"" And he wept sore and recited these verses,

""An I be healed of disease in frame, * I'm unhealed of illness in
       &nbsp     heart and sprite:
There is no healing disease of love, * Save lover and loved one
       &nbsp     to re-unite.""

Then he sat down beside her and she proceeded to talk with him and comfort him and question him of the cause and the manner of his wife's departure. So he told her and she said, ""By Allah, O my brother, I was minded to bid thee burn the feather-dress, but Satan made me forget it."" She ceased not to converse with him and caress him and company with him other ten days, whilst sleep visited him not and he delighted not in food; and when the case was longsome upon him and unrest waxed in him, he versified with these couplets,

""A beloved familiar o'erreigns my heart * And Allah's ruling
       &nbsp     reigns evermore:
She hath all the Arab's united charms * This gazelle who feeds on
       &nbsp    my bosom's core.
Though my skill and patience for love of her fail, * I weep
       &nbsp    whilst I wot that 'tis vain to deplore.
The dearling hath twice seven years, as though * She were moon of
       &nbsp     five nights and of five plus four.""[FN#106]

When the youngest Princess saw him thus distracted for love and longing for passion and the fever-heat of desire, she went in to her sisterhood weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, and shedding copious tears threw herself upon them, kissed their feet and besought them to devise some device for bringing Hasan to the Islands of Wak and effecting his reunion with his wife and wees. She ceased not to conjure them to further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep before them, till she made them weep and they said to her, ""Hearten thy heart: we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his family, Inshallah!"" And he abode with them a whole year, during which his eyes never could retain their tears. Now the sisterhood had an uncle, brother-german to their sire and his name was Abd al-Kaddús, or Slave of the Most Holy; and he loved the eldest with exceeding love and was wont to visit her once a year and do all she desired. They had told him of Hasan's adventure with the Magian and how he had been able to slay him; whereat he rejoiced and gave the eldest Princess a pouch[FN#107] which contained certain perfumes, saying, ""O daughter of my brother, an thou be in concern for aught, or if aught irk thee, or thou stand in any need, cast of these perfumes upon fire naming my name and I will be with thee forthright and will do thy desire."" This speech was spoken on the first of Moharram[FN#108]; and the eldest Princess said to one of the sisterhood, ""Lo, the year is wholly past and my uncle is not come. Rise, bring me the fire-sticks and the box of perfumes."" So the damsel arose rejoicing and, fetching what she sought, laid it before her sister, who opened the box and taking thence a little of the perfume, cast it into the fire naming her unde's name; nor was it burnt out ere appeared a dust-cloud at the farther end of the Wady; and presently lifting, it discovered a Shaykh riding on an elephant, which moved at a swift and easy pace, and trumpeted under the rider. As soon as he came within sight of the Princesses, he began making signs to them with his hands and feet; nor was it long ere he reached the castle and, alighting from the elephant, came in to them, whereupon they embraced him and kissed his hands and saluted him with the salam. Then he sat down, whilst the girls talked with him and questioned him of his absence. Quoth he, ""I was sitting but now with my wife, your aunt, when I smelt the perfumes and hastened to you on this elephant. What wouldst thou, O daughter of my brother?"" Quoth she, ""O uncle, indeed we longed for thee, as the year is past and 'tis not thy wont to be absent from us more than a twelvemonth."" Answered he, ""I was busy, but I purposed to come to you to-morrow."" Wherefore they thanked him and blessed him and sat talking with him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundredth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the girls sat down to chat with their uncle the eldest said to him ""O my uncle, we told thee the tale of Hasan of Bassorah, whom Bahram the Magian brought and how he slew the wizard and how, after enduring all manner of hardships and horrors, he made prize of the Supreme King's daughter and took her to wife and journeyed with her to his native land?"" Replied he, ""Yes, and what befel him after that?"" Quoth the Princess, ""She played him false after he was blest with two sons by her; for she took them in his absence and fled with them to her own country, saying to his mother: 'Whenas thy son returneth to thee and asketh for me and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'"" When Abd al-Kaddus heard this, he shook his head and bit his forefinger; then, bowing his brow groundwards he began to make marks on the earth with his finger-tips;[FN#109] after which he again shook his head and looked right and left and shook his head a third time, whilst Hasan watched him from a place where he was hidden from him. Then said the Princesses to their uncle, ""Return us some answer, for our hearts are rent in sunder."" But he shook his head at them, saying, ""O my daughters, verily hath this man wearied himself in vain and cast himself into grievous predicament and sore peril; for he may not gain access to the Islands of Wak."" With this the Princesses called Hasan, who came forth and, advancing to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, kissed his hand and saluted him. The old man rejoiced in him and seated him by his side; whereupon quoth the damsels, ""O uncle, acquaint our brother Hasan with that thou hast told us."" So he said to Hasan, ""O my son, put away from thee this peine forte et dure; for thou canst never gain access to the Islands of Wak, though the Flying Jinn and the Wandering Stars were with thee; for that betwixt thee and these islands are seven Wadys and seven seas and seven mighty mountains. How then canst thou come at this stead and who shall bring thee thither? Wherefore, Allah upon thee, O my son, do thou reckon thy spouse and sons as dead and turn back forthright and weary not thy sprite! Indeed, I give thee good counsel, an thou wilt but accept it."" Hearing these words from the Shaykh, Hasan wept till he fainted, and the Princesses sat round him, weeping for his weeping, whilst the youngest sister rent her raiment and buffeted her face, till she swooned away. When Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus saw them in this transport of grief and trouble and mourning, he was moved to ruth for them and cried, ""Be ye silent!"" Then said he to Hasan, ""O my son, hearten thy heart and rejoice in the winning of thy wish, an it be the will of Allah the Most High;"" presently adding, ""Rise, O my son, take courage and follow me."" So Hasan arose forthright and after he had taken leave of the Princesses followed him, rejoicing in the fulfilment of his wish. Then the Shaykh called the elephant and mounting, took Hasan up behind him and fared on three days with their nights, like the blinding leven, till he came to a vast blue mountain, whose stones were all of azure hue and amiddlemost of which was a cavern, with a door of Chinese iron. Here he took Hasan's hand and let him down and alighting dismissed the elephant. Then he went up to the door and knocked, whereupon it opened and there came out to him a black slave, hairless, as he were an Ifrit, with brand in right hand and targe of steel in left. When he saw Abd al-Kaddus, he threw sword and buckler from his grip and coming up to the Shaykh kissed his hand. Thereupon the old man took Hasan by the hand and entered with him, whilst the slave shut the door behind them; when Hasan found himself in a vast cavern and a spacious, through which ran an arched corridor and they ceased not faring on therein a mile or so, till it abutted upon a great open space and thence they made for an angle of the mountain wherein were two huge doors cast of solid brass. The old man opened one of them and said to Hasan, ""Sit at the door, whilst I go within and come back to thee in haste, and beware lest thou open it and enter."" Then he fared inside and, shutting the door after him, was absent during a full sidereal hour, after which he returned, leading a black stallion, thin of flank and short of nose, which was ready bridled and saddled, with velvet housings; and when it ran it flew, and when it flew, the very dust in vain would pursue; and brought it to Hasan, saying, ""Mount!"" So he mounted and Abd al-Kaddus opened the second door, beyond which appeared a vast desert. Then the twain passed through the door into that desert and the old man said to him, ""O my son, take this scroll and wend thou whither this steed will carry thee. When thou seest him stop at the door of a cavern like this, alight and throw the reins over the saddle-bow and let him go. He will enter the cavern, which do thou not enter with him, but tarry at the door five days, without being weary of waiting. On the sixth day there will come forth to thee a black Shaykh, clad all in sable, with a long white beard, flowing down to his navel. As soon as thou seest him, kiss his hands and seize his skirt and lay it on thy head and weep before him, till he take pity on thee and he will ask thee what thou wouldst have. When he saith to thee, 'What is thy want?' give him this scroll which he will take without speaking and go in and leave thee. Wait at the door other five days, without wearying, and on the sixth day expect him; and if he come out to thee himself, know that thy wish will be won, but, if one of his pages come forth to thee, know that he who cometh forth to thee, purposeth to kill thee; and—the Peace![FN#110] For know, O my son, that whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and First Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after handing the scroll to Hasan, Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus told him what would befal him and said, ""Whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death; but also who ventureth naught advantageth naught. However an thou fear for thy life, cast it not into danger of destruction; but, an thou fear not, up and do thy will, for I have expounded to thee the whole case. Yet shouldest thou be minded to return to thy friends, the elephant is still here and he will carry thee to my nieces, who will restore thee to thy country and return thee to thy home, and Allah will vouchsafe thee a better than this girl, of whom thou art enamoured."" Hasan answered the Shaykh, saying, ""And how shall life be sweet to me, except I win my wish? By Allah, I will never turn back, till I regain my beloved or my death overtake me!"" And he wept and recited these couplets,

""For loss of lover mine and stress of love I dree, * I stood
bewailing self in deep despondency.
Longing for him, the Spring-camp's dust I kissed and kissed, *
But this bred more of grief and galling reverie.
God guard the gone, who in our hearts must e'er abide * With
nearing woes and joys which still the farther flee.
They say me, 'Patience!' But they bore it all away: * On
parting-day, and left me naught save tormentry.
And naught affrighted me except the word he said, * 'Forget me
not when gone nor drive from memory.'
To whom shall turn I? hope in whom when you are lost? * Who were
my only hopes and joys and woes of me?
But ah, the pang of home-return when parting thus! * How joyed at
seeing me return mine enemy.
Then well-away! this 'twas I guarded me against! * And ah, thou
lowe of Love double thine ardency![FN#111]
An fled for aye my friends I'll not survive the flight; * Yet an
they deign return, Oh joy! Oh ecstacy!
Never, by Allah tears and weeping I'll contain * For loss of you,
but tears on tears and tears will rain.""
When Abd al-Kaddus heard his verse he knew that he would not turn back from his desire nor would words have effect on him, and was certified that naught would serve him but he must imperil himself, though it lose him his life. So he said to him, ""Know, O my son, that the Islands of Wak are seven islands, wherein is a mighty host, all virgin girls, and the Inner Isles are peopled by Satans and Marids and warlocks and various tribesmen of the Jinn; and whoso entereth their land never returneth thence; at least none hath done so to this day. So, Allah upon thee, return presently to thy people, for know that she whom thou seekest is the King's daughter of all these islands: and how canst thou attain to her? Hearken to me, O my son, and haply Allah will vouchsafe thee in her stead a better than she."" ""O my lord,"" answered Hasan, though for the love of her I were cut in pieces yet should I but redouble in love and transport! There is no help but that I enter the Wak Islands and come to the sight of my wife and children; and Inshallah, I will not return save with her and with them."" Said the Shaykh, ""Then nothing will serve thee but thou must make the journey?"" Hasan replied ""Nothing! and I only ask of thee thy prayers for help and aidance; so haply Allah will reunite me with my wife and children right soon."" Then he wept for stress of longing and recited these couplets,

""You are my wish, of creatures brightest-light * I deem you lief
       &nbsp   as hearing, fain as sight:
You hold my heart which hath become your home * And since you
       &nbsp   left me, lords, right sore's my plight:
Then think not I have yielded up your love, * Your love which set
       &nbsp    this wretch in fierce affright:
You went and went my joy whenas you went; * And waned and wax'ed
       &nbsp   wan the brightest light:
You left me lone to watch the stars in woe: * Railing tears
       &nbsp    likest rain-drops infinite.
Thou'rt longsome to the wight, who pining lies * On wake,
       &nbsp    moon-gazing through the night,
O Night! Wind! an thou pass the tribe where they abide * Give
       &nbsp    them my greeting, life is fain of flight.
And tell them somewhat of the pangs I bear: * The loved one
       &nbsp   kenneth not my case aright.""

Then he wept with sore weeping till he fainted away; and when he came to himself, Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus said to him, ""O my son, thou hast a mother; make her not taste the torment of thy loss."" Hasan replied, ""By Allah, O my lord, I will never return except with my wife, or my death shall overtake me."" And he wept and wailed and recited these couplets,

""By Love's right! naught of farness thy slave can estrange * Nor
       &nbsp     am I one to fail in my fealty:
I suffer such pains did I tell my case * To folk, they'd cry,
       &nbsp     'Madness! clean witless is he!'
Then ecstasy, love-longing, transport and lowe! * Whose case is
       &nbsp     such case how shall ever he be?""

With this the old man knew that he would not turn from his purpose, though it cost him his life; so he handed him the scroll and prayed for him and charged him how he should do, saying ""I have in this letter given a strict charge concerning thee to Abú al-Ruwaysh,[FN#112] son of Bilkís, daughter of Mu'in, for he is my Shaykh and my teacher, and all, men and Jinn, humble themselves to him and stand in awe of him. And now go with the blessing of God."" Hasan forthright set out giving the horse the rein, and it flew off with him swiftlier than lightning, and stayed not in its course ten days, when he saw before him a vast loom black as night, walling the world from East to West. As he neared it, the stallion neighed under him, whereupon there flocked to it horses in number as the drops of rain, none could tell their tale or against them prevail, and fell to rubbing themselves against it. Hasan was affrighted at them and fared forwards surrounded by the horses, without drawing rein till he came to the cavern which Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus had described to him. The steed stood still at the door and Hasan alighted and bridged the bridle over the saddle-bow[FN#113]; whereupon the steed entered the cavern, whilst the rider abode without, as the old man had charged him, pondering the issue of his case in perplexity and distraction and unknowing what would befal him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Second Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan, dismounting from the steed, stood at the cavern-mouth pondering the issue of his case and unknowing what might befal him. He abode standing on the same spot five days with their nights, sleepless, mournful, tearful-eyed; distracted, perplexed, pondering his severance from home and family, comrades and friends, with weeping eye-lids and heavy heart. Then he bethought him of his mother and of what might yet happen to him and of his separation from his wife and children and of all that he had suffered, and he recited these couplets,

""With you is my heart-cure a heart that goes; * And from
       &nbsp     hill-foot of eyelids the tear-rill flows:
And parting and sorrow and exile and dole * And farness from
       &nbsp     country and throe that o'erthrows:
Naught am I save a lover distracted by love, * Far parted from
       &nbsp     loved one and wilted by woes.
And 'tis Love that hath brought me such sorrow, say where * Is
       &nbsp     the noble of soul who such sorrow unknows?""

Hardly had Hasan made an end of his verses, when out came the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, a blackamoor and clad in black raiment, and at first sight he knew him by the description that Abd al-Kaddus had given him. He threw himself at his feet and rubbed his cheeks on them and seizing his skirt, laid it on his head and wept before him. Quoth the old man, ""What wantest thou, O my son?"" Whereupon he put out his hand to him with the letter, and Abu al-Ruwaysh took it and reentered the cavern, without making him any answer. So Hasan sat down at the cave-mouth in his place other five days as he had been bidden, whilst concern grew upon him and terror redoubled on him and restlessness gat hold of him, and he fell to weeping and bemoaning himself for the anguish of estrangement and much watching. And he recited these couplets,

""Glory to Him who guides the skies! * The lover sore in sorrow
       &nbsp     lies.
Who hath not tasted of Love's food * Knows not what mean its
       &nbsp     miseries.
Did I attempt to stem my tears * Rivers of blood would fount and
       &nbsp    rise.
How many an intimate is hard * Of heart, and pains in sorest
       &nbsp    wise!
An she with me her word would keep, * Of tears and sighs I'd fain
       &nbsp     devise,
But I'm forgone, rejected quite * Ruin on me hath cast her eyes.
At my fell pangs fell wildlings weep * And not a bird for me but
       &nbsp     cries.""

Hasan ceased not to weep till dawn of the sixth day, when Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh came forth to him, clad in white raiment, and with his hand signed[FN#114] to him to enter. So he went in, rejoicing and assured of the winning of his wish, and the old man took him by the hand and leading him into the cavern, fared on with him half a day's journey, till they reached an arched doorway with a door of steel. The Shaykh opened the door and they two entered a vestibule vaulted with onyx stones and arabesqued with gold, and they stayed not walking till they came to a great hall and a wide, paved and walled with marble. In its midst was a flower-garden containing all manner trees and flowers and fruits, with birds warbling on the boughs and singing the praises of Allah the Almighty Sovran; and there were four daises, each facing other, and in each dais a jetting fountain, at whose corners stood lions of red gold, spouting gerbes from their mouths into the basin. On each dais stood a chair, whereon sat an elder, with exceeding store of books before him[FN#115] and censers of gold, containing fire and perfumes, and before each elder were students, who read the books to him. Now when the twain entered, the elders rose to them and did them honour; whereupon Abu al-Ruwaysh signed to them to dismiss their scholars and they did so. Then the four arose and seating themselves before that Shaykh, asked him of the case of Hasan to whom he said, ""Tell the company thy tale and all that hath betided thee from the beginning of thine adventure to the end."" So Hasan wept with sore weeping and related to them his story with Bahram; whereupon all the Shaykhs cried out and said, ""Is this indeed he whom the Magian caused to climb the Mountain of Clouds by means of the vultures, sewn up in the camel-hide?"" And Hasan said, ""Yes."" So they turned to the Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh and said to him, ""O our Shaykh, of a truth Bahram contrived his mounting to the mountaintop; but how came he down and what marvels saw he there?"" And Abu al-Ruwaysh said, ""O Hasan, tell them how thou camest down and acquaint them with what thou sawest of marvels."" So he told them all that had befallen him, first and last; how he had gotten the Magian into his power and slain him, how he had delivered the youth from him and sent him back to his own country, and how he had captured the King's daughter of the Jinn and married her; yet had she played him false and taken the two boys she had borne him and flown away; brief, he related to them all the hardships and horrors he had undergone; whereat they marvelled, each and every, and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""O elder of elders, verily by Allah, this youth is to be pitied! But belike thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Third Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan told his tale to the elders, they said to Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""This youth is to be pitied and haply thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees."" He replied, ""O my brothers, in very sooth this is a grave matter and a perilous; and never saw I any loathe his life save this youth. You know that the Islands of Wak are hard of access and that none may come to them but at risk of life; and ye know also the strength of their people and their guards. Moreover I have sworn an oath not to tread their soil nor transgress against them in aught; so how shall this man come at the daughter of the Great King, and who hath power to bring him to her or help him in this matter?"" Replied the other, ""O Shaykh of Shaykhs, verily this man is consumed with desire and he hath endangered himself to bring thee a scroll from thy brother Abd al-Kaddus; wherefore it behoveth thee to help him."" And Hasan arose and kissed Abu al-Ruwaysh's feet and raising the hem of his garment laid it on his head, weeping and crying. ""I beseech thee, by Allah, to reunite me with my wife and children, though it cost me my life and my soul!"" The four elders all wept for his weeping and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""Deal generously with this unhappy and show him kindness for the sake of thy brother Abd al-Kaddus and profit by this occasion to earn reward from Allah for helping him."" Quoth he, ""This wilful youth weeteth not what he undertaketh; but Inshallah! we will help him after the measure of our means, nor leave aught feasible undone."" When Hasan heard the Shaykh's word he rejoiced and kissed the hands of the five elders, one after other, imploring their aidance. Thereupon Abd al-Ruwaysh took inkcase and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter, which he sealed and gave to Hasan, together with a pouch of perfumed leather,[FN#116] containing incense and fire-sticks[FN#117] and other needs, and said to him, ""Take strictest care of this pouch, and whenas thou fallest into any strait, burn a little of the incense therein and name my name, whereupon I will be with thee forthright and save thee from thy stress."" Moreover, he bade one of those present fetch him an Ifrit of the Flying Jinn; and he did so incontinently; whereupon quoth Abu al-Ruwaysh to the fire-drake, ""What is thy name!"" Replied the Ifrit, ""Thy thrall is hight Dahnash bin Faktash."" And the Shaykh said ""Draw near to me!"" So Dahnash drew near to him and he put his mouth to his ear and said somewhat to him, whereat the Ifrit shook his head and answered, ""I accept, O elder of elders!"" Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, ""Arise, O my son, mount the shoulders of this Ifrit, Dahnash the Flyer; but, when he heaveth thee heavenwards and thou hearest the angels glorifying God a-welkin with 'Subhána Iláh,' have a care lest thou do the like; else wilt thou perish and he too."" Hasan replied, ""I will not say a word; no, never;"" and the old man continued, ""O Hasan, after faring with thee all this day, to-morrow at peep of dawn he will set thee down in a land cleanly white, like unto camphor, whereupon do thou walk on ten days by thyself, till thou come to the gate of a city. Then enter and enquire for the King of the city; and when thou comest to his presence, salute him with the salam and kiss his hand: then give him this scroll and consider well whatso he shall counsel thee,"" Hasan replied, ""Hearing and obeying,"" and rose up and mounted the Ifrit's shoulders, whilst the elders rose and offered up prayers for him and commended him to the care of Dahnash the Firedrake. And when he had perched on the Flyer's back the Ifrit soared with him to the very confines of the sky, till he heard the angels glorifying God in Heaven, and flew on with him a day and a night till at dawn of the next day he set him down in a land white as camphor, and went his way, leaving him there. When Hasan found himself in the land aforesaid with none by his side he fared on night and day for ten days, till he came to the gate of the city in question and entering, enquired for the King. They directed him to him and told him that his name was King Hassún,[FN#118] Lord of the Land of Camphor, and that he had troops and soldiers enough to fill the earth in its length and breadth. So he sought audience of him and, being admitted to his presence, found him a mighty King and kissed ground between his hands. Quoth the King, ""What is thy want?"" Whereupon Hasan kissed the letter and gave it to him. The King read it and shook his head awhile, then said to one of his officers, ""Take this youth and lodge him in the house of hospitality."" So he took him and stablished him in the guest-house, where he tarried three days, eating and drinking and seeing none but the eunuch who waited on him and who entertained him with discourse and cheered him with his company, questioning him of his case and how he came to that city; whereupon he told him his whole story, and the perilous condition wherein he was. On the fourth day, that eunuch carried him before the King, who said to him, ""O Hasan, thou comest to me, seeking to enter the Islands of Wak, as the Shaykh of Shaykhs adviseth me. O my son, I would send thee thither this very day, but that by the way are many perils and thirsty wolds full of terrors; yet do thou have patience and naught save fair shall befal thee, for needs must I devise to bring thee to thy desire, Inshallah! Know, O my son, that here is a mighty host,[FN#119] equipped with arms and steeds and warlike gear, who long to enter the Wak Islands and lack power thereto. But, O my son, for the sake of the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, son of Bilkis,[FN#120] the daughter of Mu'in, I may not send thee back to him unfulfilled of thine affair. Presently there will come to us ships from the Islands of Wak and the first that shall arrive I will send thee on board of her and give thee in charge to the sailors, so they may take care of thee and carry thee to the Islands. If any question thee of thy case and condition, answer him saying, 'I am kinsman to King Hassun, Lord of the Land of Camphor;' and when the ship shall make fast to the shore of the Islands of Wak and the master shall bid thee land, do thou land. Now as soon as thou comest ashore, thou wilt see a multitude of wooden settles all about the beach, of which do thou choose thee one and crouch under it and stir not. And when dark night sets in, thou wilt see an army of women appear and flock about the goods landed from the ship, and one of them will sit down on the settle, under which thou hast hidden thyself, whereupon do thou put forth thy hand to her and take hold of her and implore her protection. And know thou, O my son, that an she accord thee protection, thou wilt win thy wish and regain thy wife and children; but, if she refuse to protect thee, make thy mourning for thyself and give up all hope of life, and make sure of death for indeed thou art a dead man. Understand, O my son, that thou adventurest thy life and this is all I can do for thee, and—the peace!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Fourth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Hassun spake these words to Hasan and charged him as we have related, ending with, ""This is all I can do for thee and know that except the Lord of Heaven had aided thee, thou hadst not come hither!"" The youth wept till he swooned away, and when he recovered, he recited these two couplets,

""A term decreed my lot I 'spy; * And, when its days shall end, I
       &nbsp     die.
Though lions fought with me in lair * If Time be mine I'd beat
       &nbsp     them, I!""

Then having ended his verse he kissed the ground before the Sovran and said to him, ""O mighty King, how many days remain till the coming of the ships?"" Replied the other, ""In a month's time they will come and will tarry here, selling their cargueson, other two months, after which they will return to their own country; so hope not to set out save after three whole months."" Then the King bade him return to the house of hospitality and bade supply him with all that he needed of meat and drink and raiment fit for Kings. Hasan abode in the guest-house a month, at the end of which the vessels arrived and the King and the merchants went forth to them, taking Hasan with them. Amongst them he saw a ship with much people therein, like the shingles for number; none knew their tale save He who created them. She was anchored in mid-harbour and had cocks which transported her lading to the shore. So Hasan abode till the crew had landed all the goods and sold and bought and to the time of departure there wanted but three days; whereupon the King sent for him and equipped him with all he required and gave him great gifts: after which he summoned the captain of the great ship and said to him, ""Take this youth with thee in the vessel, so none may know of him save thou, and carry him to the Islands of Wak and leave him there; and bring him not back."" And the Rais said, ""To hear is to obey: with love and gladness!"" Then quoth the King to Hasan, ""Look thou tell none of those who are with thee in the ship thine errand nor discover to them aught of thy case; else thou art a lost man;"" and quoth he, ""Hearing and obedience!"" With this he farewelled the King, after he had wished him long life and victory over his enviers and his enemies; wherefore the King thanked him and wished him safety and the winning of his wish. Then he committed him to the captain, who laid him in a chest which he embarked in a dinghy, and bore him aboard, whilst the folk were busy in breaking bulk and no man doubted but the chest contained somewhat of merchandise. After this, the vessels set sail and fared on without ceasing ten days, and on the eleventh day they made the land. So the Rais set Hasan ashore and, as he walked up the beach, he saw wooden settles[FN#121] without number, none knew their count save Allah, even as the King had told him. He went on, till he came to one that had no fellow and hid under it till nightfall, when there came up a mighty many of women, as they were locusts over-swarming the land and they marched afoot and armed cap-à-pie in hauberks and strait-knit coats of mail hending drawn swords in their hands, who, seeing the merchandise landed from the ships, busied themselves therewith. Presently they sat down to rest themselves, and one of them seated herself on the settle under which Hasan had crouched: whereupon he took hold of the hem of her garment and laid it on his head and throwing himself before her, fell to kissing her hands and feet and weeping and crying, ""Thy protection! thy good-will!"" Quoth she, ""Ho, thou! Arise and stand up, ere any see thee and slay thee."" So he came forth and springing up kissed her hands and wept and said to her, ""O my mistress, I am under thy protection!""; adding, ""Have ruth on one who is parted from his people and wife and children, one who hath haste to rejoin them and one who adventureth life and soul for their sake! Take pity on me and be assured that therefor Paradise will be thy reward; or, an thou wilt not receive me, I beseech thee, by Allah the Great, the Concealer, to conceal my case!"" The merchants stared to see him talking with her; and she, hearing his words and beholding his humility, was moved to ruth for him; her heart inclined to him and she knew that he had not ventured himself and come to that place, save for a grave matter. So she said to him, ""O my son, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, hearten thy heart and take courage and return to thy hiding-place till the coming night, and Allah shall do as He will."" Then she took leave of him and Hasan crept under the wooden settle as before, whilst the troops lighted flambeaux of wax mixed with aloes-wood and Nadd-perfume and crude ambergris[FN#122] and passed the night in sport and delight till the morning. At daybreak, the boats returned to the shore and the merchants busied themselves with buying and selling and the transport of the goods and gear till nightfall, whilst Hasan lay hidden beneath the settle, weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, knowing not what was decreed to him in the secret preordainment of Allah. As he was thus, behold, the merchant-woman with whom he had taken refuge came up to him and giving him a habergeon and a helmet, a spear, a sword and a gilded girdle, bade him don them and seat himself on the settle after which she left him, for fear of the troops. So he arose and donned the mail-coat and helmet and clasped the girdle about his middle; then he slung the sword over his shoulder till it hung under his armpit, and taking the spear in his hand, sat down on that settle, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and call on Him for protection.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Fifth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan received the weapons which the merchant-woman had given to him, saying, ""Sit thee upon the settle and let none wot thy case,"" he armed himself and took his seat, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and to call upon Him for protection. And behold, there appeared cressets and lanthorns and flambeaux and up came the army of women. So he arose and mingling with them, became as one of them. A little before daybreak, they set out, and Hasan with them, and fared on till they came to their camp, where they dispersed each to her tent, and Hasan followed one of them and lo! it was hers for whose protection he had prayed. When she entered, she threw down her arms and doffed her hauberk and veil. So Hasan did the like and looking at his companion, saw her to be a grizzled old woman blue-eyed and big-nosed, a calamity of calamities, the foulest of all created things, with face pock-marked and eyebrows bald, gap-toothed and chap-fallen, with hair hoary, nose running and mouth slavering;[FN#123] even as saith the like of her the poet,

""In her cheek-corners nine calamities * Wone, and when shown,
       &nbsp   each one Jehannam is:
Hideous the face and favour foulest foul * As cheek of hog; yea,
       &nbsp     'tis a cesspool phiz.""

And indeed she was like a pied snake or a scald she-wolf. Now when the old woman looked at Hasan, she marvelled and said, ""How came this one to these lands and in which of the ships was he and how arrived he hither in safety?"" And she fell to questioning him of his case and admiring at his arrival, whereupon he fell at her feet and rubbed his face on them and wept till he fainted; and, when he recovered himself, he recited these couplets,

""When will Time grant we meet, when shall we be * Again united
       &nbsp     after severance stark?
And I shall win my choicest wish and view? * Blame end and Love
       &nbsp    abide without remark?
Were Nile to flow as freely as my tears, * 'Twould leave no
       &nbsp    region but with water-mark:
'Twould overthrow Hijaz and Egypt-land * 'Twould deluge Syria and
       &nbsp    'twould drown Irák.
This, O my love, is caused by thy disdain, * Be kind and promise
       &nbsp    meeting fair and fain!""

Then he took the crone's skirt and laid it on his head and fell to weeping and craving her protection. When she saw his ardency and transport and anguish and distress, her heart softened to him and she promised him her safeguard, saying, ""Have no fear whatsoever."" Then she questioned him of his case and he told her the manner of his coming thither and all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat she marvelled and said, ""This that hath betide thee, methinks, never betided any save thyself and except thou hadst been vouchsafed the especial protection of Allah, thou hadst not been saved: but now, O my son, take comfort and be of good courage; thou hast nothing more to fear, for indeed thou hast won thy wish and attained thy desire, if it please the Most High!"" Thereat Hasan rejoiced with joy exceeding and she sent to summon the captains of the army to her presence, and it was the last day of the month. So they presented themselves and the old woman said to them, ""Go out and proclaim to all the troops that they come forth to-morrow at daybreak and let none tarry behind, for whoso tarryeth shall be slain."" They replied, ""We hear and we obey,"" and going forth, made proclamation to all the host anent a review next morning, even as she bade them, after which they returned and told her of this; whereby Hasan knew that she was the Commander-in-chief of the army and the Viceregent in authority over them; and her name was Shawahí the Fascinator, entituled Umm al-Dawáhi, or Mother of Calamities.[FN#124] She ceased not to bid and forbid and Hasan doffed not off his arms from his body that day. Now when the morning broke, all the troops fared forth from their places, but the old woman came not out with them, and as soon as they were sped and the stead was clear of them, she said to Hasan, ""Draw near unto me, O my son[FN#125]."" So he drew near unto her and stood between her hands. Quoth she, ""Why and wherefore hast thou adventured thyself so boldly as to enter this land, and how came thy soul to consent to its own undoing? Tell me the truth and the whole truth and fear aught of ill come of it, for thou hast my plighted word and I am moved to compassion for thy case and pity thee and have taken thee under my protection. So, if thou tell me the truth, I will help thee to win thy wish, though it involve the undoing of souls and the destruction of bodies; and since thou hast come to seek me, no hurt shall betide thee from me, nor will I suffer any to have at thee with harm of all who be in the Islands of Wak."" So he told her his tale from first to last, acquainting her with the matter of his wife and of the birds; how he had captured her as his prize from amongst the ten and married her and abode with her, till she had borne him two sons, and how she had taken her children and flown away with them, whenas she knew the way to the feather-dress. Brief, he concealed from her no whit of his case, from the beginning to that day. But when Shawahi heard his relation, she shook her head and said to him, ""Glory be to God who hath brought thee hither in safety and made thee hap upon me! For, hadst thou happened on any but myself, thou hadst lost thy life without winning thy wish; but the truth of thine intent and thy fond affection and the excess of thy love-longing for thy wife and yearning for thy children, these it was that have brought thee to the attainment of thine aim. Didst thou not love her and love her to distraction, thou hadst not thus imperilled thyself, and Alhamdolillah—Praised be Allah—for thy safety! Wherefore it behoveth us to do thy desire and conduce to thy quest, so thou mayst presently attain that thou seekest, if it be the will of Almighty Allah. But know, O my son, that thy wife is not here, but in the seventh of the Islands of Wak and between us and it is seven months' journey, night and day. From here we go to an island called the Land of Birds, wherein, for the loud crying of the birds and the flapping of their wings, one cannot hear other speak.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Sixth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to Hasan, ""Indeed thy wife is in the Seventh Island,[FN#126] the greatest amongst the Islands of Wak and betwixt us and it is a seven-months' journey. From here we fare for the Land of Birds, whereon for the force of their flying and the flapping of their wings, we cannot hear one other speak. Over that country we journey night and day, eleven days, after which we come forth of it to another called the Land of Ferals where, for stress of roaring of lions and howling of wolves and laughing of hyaenas and the crying of other beasts of prey we shall hear naught, and therein we travel twenty days' journey. Then we issue therefrom and come to a third country, called the Land of the Jánn, where, for stress of the crying of the Jinn and the flaming of fires and the flight of sparks and smoke from their mouths and the noise of their groaning and their arrogance in blocking up the road before us, our ears will be deafened and our eyes blinded, so that we shall neither hear nor see, nor dare any look behind him, or he perisheth: but there horseman boweth head on saddle-bow and raiseth it not for three days. After this, we abut upon a mighty mountain and a running river contiguous with the Isles of Wak, which are seven in number and the extent whereof is a whole year's journey for a well-girt horseman. And thou must know, O my son, that these troops are all virgin girls, and that the ruler over us is a woman of the Archipelago of Wak. On the bank of the river aforesaid is another mountain, called Mount Wak, and it is thus named by reason of a tree which beareth fruits like heads of the Sons of Adam.[FN#127] When the sun riseth on them, the heads cry out all, saying in their cries:— 'Wak! Wak! Glory be to the Creating King, Al-Khallák!' And when we hear their crying, we know that the sun is risen. In like manner, at sundown, the heads set up the same cry, 'Wak! Wak! Glory to Al-Khallak!' and so we know that the sun hath set. No man may abide with us or reach to us or tread our earth: and betwixt us and the abiding-place of the Queen who ruleth over us is a month's journey from this shore, all the lieges whereof are under her hand, as are also the tribes of the Jinn, Marids and Satans, while of the warlocks none kenneth the number save He who created them. Wherefore, an thou be afraid, I will send with thee one who will convey thee to the coast and there bring one who will embark thee on board a ship that bear thee to thine own land. But an thou be content to tarry with us, I will not forbid thee and thou shalt be with me in mine eye,[FN#128] till thou win thy wish, Inshallah!"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, I will never quit thee till I foregather with my wife or lose my life!""; and quoth she, ""This is a light matter; be of good heart, for soon shalt thou come to thy desire, Allah willing; and there is no help but that I let the Queen know of thee, that she may help thee to attain thine aim."" Hasan blessed her and kissed her head and hands, thanking her for her good deed and exceeding kindness and firm will. Then he set out with her, pondering the issue of his case and the horrors of his strangerhood; wherefore he fell a-weeping and a-wailing and recited these couplets,

""A Zephyr bloweth from the lover's site; * And thou canst view me
       &nbsp   in the saddest plight:
The Night of Union is as brilliant morn; * And black the
       &nbsp   Severance-day as blackest night:
Farewelling friend is sorrow sorest sore * Parting from lover's
       &nbsp   merest undelight.
I will not blame her harshness save to her, * And 'mid mankind
       &nbsp   nor friend nor fere I sight:
How can I be consoled for loss of you? * Base censor's blame
       &nbsp   shall not console my sprite!
O thou in charms unique, unique's my love; * O peerless thou, my
       &nbsp   heart hath peerless might!
Who maketh semblance that be loveth you * And dreadeth blame is
       &nbsp   most blame-worthy wight.""

Then the old woman bade beat the kettle-drums for departure and the army set out. Hasan fared with her, drowned in the sea of solicitude and reciting verses like those above, whilst she strave to comfort him and exhorted him to patience; but he awoke not from his tristesse and heeded not her exhortations. They journeyed thus till they came to the boundaries of the Land of Birds[FN#129] and when they entered it, it seemed to Hasan as if the world were turned topsy-turvy for the exceeding clamour. His head ached and his mind was dazed, his eyes were blinded and his ears deafened, and he feared with exceeding fear and made certain of deaths saying to himself, ""If this be the Land of Birds, how will be the Land of Beasts?"" But, when the crone hight Shawahi saw him in this plight, she laughed at him, saying, ""O my son, if this be thy case in the first island, how will it fare with thee, when thou comest to the others?"" So he prayed to Allah and humbled himself before the Lord, beseeching Him to assist him against that wherewith He had afflicted him and bring him to his wishes; and they ceased not going till they passed out of the Land of Birds and, traversing the Land of Beasts, came to the Land of the Jann which when Hasan saw, he was sore affrighted and repented him of having entered it with them. But he sought aid of Allah the Most High and fared on with them, till they were quit of the Land of the Jann and came to the river and set down their loads at the foot of a vast mountain and a lofty, and pitched their tents by the stream-bank. Then they rested and ate and drank and slept in security, for they were come to their own country. On the morrow the old woman set Hasan a couch of alabaster, inlaid with pearls and jewels and nuggets of red gold, by the river-side, and he sat down thereon, having first bound his face with a chin-kerchief, that discovered naught of him but his eyes. Then she bade proclaim among the troops that they should all assemble before her tent and put off their clothes and go down into the stream and wash; and this she did that she might parade before him all the girls, so haply his wife should be amongst them and he know her. So the whole army mustered before her and putting off their clothes, went down into the stream, and Hasan seated on his couch watched them washing their white skins and frolicking and making merry, whilst they took no heed of his inspecting them, deeming him to be of the daughters of the Kings. When he beheld them stripped of their clothes, his chord stiffened for that looking at them mother-naked he saw what was between their thighs, and that of all kinds, soft and rounded, plump and cushioned; large-lipped, perfect, redundant and ample,[FN#130] and their faces were as moons and their hair as night upon day, for that they were of the daughters of the Kings. When they were clean, they came up out of the water, stark naked, as the moon on the night of fullness and the old woman questioned Hasan of them, company by company, if his wife were among them; but, as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, ""She is not among these, O my lady.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Seventh Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman questioned Hasan of the girls, company after company, if haply his wife were among them; but as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, ""She is not among these, O my lady!"" Last of all, there came up a damsel, attended by ten slave-girls and thirty waiting-women, all of them high-bosomed maidens. They put off their clothes and went down into the river, where the damsel fell to riding the high horse over her women, throwing them down and ducking them. On this wise she continued for a full hour, after which all came up out of the water and sat down; and they brought her napkins[FN#131] of gold-purfled silk, with which she dried herself. Then they brought her clothes and jewels and ornaments of the handiwork of the Jinn, and she donned them and rose and walked with graceful pace among the troops, she and her maidens. When Hasan saw her, his heart was ready to fly from his breast and he said, ""Verily this girl is the likest of all folk to the bird I saw in the basin atop of the palace of my sisters the Princesses, and she lorded it over her lieges even as doth this one."" The old woman asked, ""O Hasan, is this thy wife?""; and he answered, ""No, by thy life, O my lady; this is not my wife, nor ever in my life have I set eyes on her; neither among all the girls I have seen in these islands is there the like of my wife nor her match for symmetry and grace and beauty and loveliness!"" Then said Shawaki, ""Describe her to me and acquaint me with all her attributes, that I may have her in my mind; for I know every girl in the Islands of Wak, being commander of the army of maids and governor over them; wherefore, an thou describe her to me, I shall know her and will contrive for thee to take her."" Quoth he, ""My wife hath the fairest face and a form all grace; smooth is she of cheeks and high of breasts with eyes of liquid light, calves and thighs plump to sight, teeth snowy white, with dulcet speech dight; in speech soft and bland as she were a willow-wand; her gifts are a moral and lips are red as coral; her eyes wear natural Kohl-dye and her lower labia[FN#132] in softness lie. On her right cheek is a mole and on her waist, under her navel, is a sign; her face shines as the rondure of the moon in sheen, her waist is slight, her hips a heavy weight, and the water of her mouth the sick doth heal, as it were Kausar or Salsabil.""[FN#133] Said the old woman, ""Give me an increased account of her, Allah increase thee of passion for her!"" Quoth he, ""My wife hath a face the fairest fair and oval cheeks the rarest rare; neck long and spare and eyes that Kohl wear; her side face shows the Anemones of Nu'uman, her mouth is like a seal of cornelian and flashing teeth that lure and stand one in stead of cup and ewer. She is cast in the mould of pleasantness and between her thighs is the throne of the Caliphate, there is no such sanctuary among the Holy Places; as saith in its praise the poet,

""The name of what drave me distraught * Hath letters renowned
       &nbsp  among men:
A four into five multiplied * And a multiplied six into
       &nbsp  ten.[FN#134]""

Then Hasan wept and chanted the following Mawwál,[FN#135]

""O heart, an lover false thee, shun the parting bane * Nor to
       &nbsp  forgetfulness thy thoughts constrain:
Be patient; thou shalt bury all thy foes; * Allah ne'er falseth
       &nbsp  man of patience fain.""

And this also,

""An wouldst be life,long safe, vaunt not delight; * Never
       &nbsp   despair, nor wone o'erjoyed in sprite!
Forbear, rejoice not, mourn not o'er thy plight * And in ill day
       &nbsp   'Have not we oped?'—recite.""[FN#136]

Thereupon the old woman bowed her head groundwards awhile, then, raising it, said, ""Laud be to the Lord, the Mighty of Award! Indeed I am afflicted with thee, O Hasan! Would Heaven I had never known thee! This woman, whom thou describest to me as thy wife, I know by description and I know her to be none other than the eldest daughter of the Supreme King, she who ruleth over all the Islands of Wak. So open both eyes and consider thy case; and if thou be asleep, awake; for, if this woman be indeed thy wife, it is impossible for thee ever to obtain her, and though thou come to her, yet couldst thou not avail to her possession, since between thee and her the distance is as that between earth and Heaven. Wherefore, O my son, return presently and cast not thyself into destruction nor cast me with thee; for meseemeth thou hast no lot in her; so return whence thou camest lest our lives be lost."" And she feared for herself and for him. When Hasan heard her words, he wept till he fainted and she left not sprinkling water on his face, till he came to himself, when he continued to weep, so that he drenched his dress with tears, for the much cark and care and chagrin which betided him by reason of her words. And indeed he despaired of life and said to the old woman, ""O my lady, and how shall I go back, after having come hither? Verily, I thought not thou wouldst forsake me nor fail of the winning of my wish, especially as thou art the Commander-in-chief of the army of the girls."" Answered Shawahl, ""O my son, I doubted not but thy wife was a maid of the maids, and had I known she was the King's daughter, I had not suffered thee to come hither nor had I shown the troops to thee, for all the love I bear thee. But now, O my son, thou hast seen all the girls naked; so tell me which of them pleaseth thee and I will give her to thee, in lieu of thy wife, and do thou put it that thy wife and children are dead and take her and return to thine own country in safety, ere thou fall into the King's hand and I have no means of delivering thee. So, Allah upon thee, O my son, hearken unto me. Choose thyself one of these damsels, in the stead of yonder woman, and return presently to thy country in safety and cause me not quaff the cup of thine anguish! For, by Allah, thou hast cast thyself into affliction sore and peril galore, wherefrom none may avail to deliver thee evermore!"" But Hasan hung down his head and wept with long weeping and recited these couplets,

""'Blame not!' said I to all who blamèd me; * 'Mine eye-lids
       &nbsp   naught but tears were made to dree:'
The tears that brim these orbs have overflowed * My checks, for
       &nbsp    lovers and love's cruelty.
Leave me to love though waste this form of me! * For I of Love
       &nbsp    adore the insanity:
And, Oh my dearling, passion grows on me * For you—and you, why
       &nbsp  grudge me clemency?
You wronged me after swearing troth and plight, * Falsed my
       &nbsp  companionship and turned to flee:
And cup of humbling for your rigours sore * Ye made me drain what
       &nbsp     day departed ye:
Then melt, O heart, with longing for their sight * And, O mine
       &nbsp    eyes, with crowns of tears be dight.""

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman said to Hasan, ""By Allah, O my son, hearken to my words! Choose thee one of these girls in lieu of thy wife and presently return to thy country in safety,"" he hung down his head and recited the couplets quoted above. Then he wept till he swooned away and Shawahl sprinkled water on his face till he revived, when she addressed him, ""O my lord, I have no shift left; because if I carry thee to the city thy life is lost and mine also: for, when the Queen cometh to know of this, she will blame me for admitting thee into her lands and islands, whereto none of Adam's sons hath access, and will slay me for bringing thee with me and for suffering mortal to look upon the virgins seen by thee in the sea, whom ne'er touched male, neither approached mate."" And Hasan sware that he had never looked on them with evil of eye. She resumed, ""O my son, hearken to me and return to thy country and I will give thee wealth and treasures and things of price, such as shall suffice thee for all the women in the world. Moreover, I will give thee a girl of the best of them, so lend an ear to my words and return presently and imperil not thyself; indeed I counsel thee with good counsel."" But he wept and rubbed both cheeks against her feet, saying, ""O my lady and mistress and coolth of mine eyes, how can I turn back now that I have made my way hither, without the sight of those I desire, and now that I have come near the beloved's site, hoping for meeting forthright, so haply there may be a portion in reunion to my plight?"" And he improvised these couplets,

""O Kings of beauty, grace to prisoner ta'en * Of eyelids fit to
       &nbsp   rule the Chosroës' reign:
Ye pass the wafts of musk in perfumed breath; * Your cheeks the
       &nbsp    charms of blooming rose disdain.
The softest Zephyr breathes where pitch ye camp * And thence
       &nbsp    far-scattered sweetness fills the plain:
Censor of me, leave blame and stint advice! * Thou bringest
       &nbsp    wearying words and wisdom vain:
Why heat my passion with this flame and up- * braid me when
       &nbsp    naught thou knowest of its bane?
Captured me eyes with passion maladifs, * And overthrew me with
       &nbsp   Love's might and main:
I scatter tears the while I scatter verse; * You are my theme for
       &nbsp   rhyme and prosy strain.
Melted my vitals glow of rosy cheeks * And in the Lazá-lowe my
       &nbsp    heart is lain:
Tell me, an I leave to discourse of you, * What speech my breast
       &nbsp    shall broaden?
Tell me deign! Life-long I loved the lovelings fair, but ah, * To
       &nbsp     grant my wish eke Allah must be fain!""

Hearing his verses the old woman was moved to ruth for him and Allah planted the seed of affection for him in her heart; so coming up to him she consoled him, saying, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and put away trouble from thy thought, for, by Allah, I will venture my life with thee, till thou attain thine aim or death undo me!"" With this, Hasan's heart was comforted and his bosom broadened and he sat talking with the old woman till the end of the day, when all the girls dispersed, some entering their town-mansions and others nighting in the tents. Then the old woman carried him into the city and lodged him in a place apart, lest any should come to know of him and tell the Queen of him and she should slay him and slay her who had brought him thither. Moreover, she served him herself and strave to put him in fear of the awful majesty of the Supreme King, his wife's father; whilst he wept before her and said, ""O my fady, I choose death for myself and loathe this worldly life, if I foregather not with my wife and children: I have set my existence on the venture and will either attain my aim or die."" So the old woman fell to pondering the means of bringing him and his wife together and casting about how to do in the case of this unhappy one, who had thrown himself into destruction and would not be diverted from his purpose by fear or aught else; for, indeed he reeked not of his life and the sayer of bywords saith, ""Lover in nowise hearkeneth he to the speech of the man who is fancy-free."" Now the name of the Queen of the island wherein they were was Núr al-Hudà,[FN#137] eldest daughter of the Supreme King, and she had six virgin sisters, abiding with their father, whose capital and court were in the chief city of that region and who had made her ruler over all the lands and islands of Wak. So when the ancient dame saw Hasan on fire with yearning after his wife and children, she rose up and repaired to the palace and going in to Queen Nur al-Huda kissed ground before her; for she had a claim on her favour because she had reared the King's daughters one and all and had authority over each and every of them and was high in honour and consideration with them and with the King. Nur al-Huda rose to her as she entered and embracing her, seated her by her side and asked her of her journey. She answered, ""By Allah, O my lady 'twas a blessed journey and I have brought thee a gift which I will presently present to thee,"" adding, ""O my daughter, O Queen of the age and the time, I have a favour to crave of thee and I fain would discover it to thee, that thou mayst help me to accomplish it, and but for my confidence that thou wilt not gainsay me therein, I would not expose it to thee."" Asked the Queen, ""And what is thy need? Expound it to me, and I will accomplish it to thee, for I and my kingdom and troops are all at thy commandment and disposition."" Therewithal the old woman quivered as quivereth the reed on a day when the storm-wind is abroad and saying in herself, ""O[FN#138] Protector, protect me from the Queen's mischief!""[FN#139] fell down before her and acquainted her with Hasan's case, saying, ""O my lady, a man, who had hidden himself under my wooden settle on the seashore, sought my protection; so I took him under my safeguard and carried him with me among the army of girls armed and accoutred so that none might know him, and brought him into the city; and indeed I have striven to affright him with thy fierceness, giving him to know of thy power and prowess; but, as often as I threatened him, he weepeth and reciteth verses and sayeth, 'Needs must I have my wife and children or die, and I will not return to my country without them.' And indeed he hath adventured himself and come to the Islands of Wak, and never in all my days saw I mortal heartier of heart than he or doughtier of derring-do, save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Ninth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman related to Queen Nur al-Huda the adventure of Hasan, ending with, ""Never I saw any one heartier of heart than he save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery,"" the Queen, after lending an attentive ear and comprehending the case, waxed wroth at her with exceeding wrath and bowed her head awhile groundwards; then, raising it, she looked at Shawahi and said to her, ""O ill-omened beldam, art thou come to such a pass of lewdness that thou carriest males, men, with thee into the Islands of Wak and bringest them into me, unfearing of my mischief? Who hath foregone thee with this fashion, that thou shouldst do thus? By the head of the King, but for thy claim on me for fosterage and service, I would forthwith do both him and thee to die the foulest of deaths, that travellers might take warning by thee, O accursed, lest any other do the like of this outrageous deed thou hast done, which none durst hitherto! But go and bring him hither forthright, that I may see him; or I will strike off thy head, O accursed."" So the old woman went out from her, confounded, unknowing whither she went and saying, ""All this calamity hath Allah driven upon me from this Queen because of Hasan!"" and going in to him, said, ""Rise, speak with the Queen, O wight whose last hour is at hand!"" So he rose and went with her, whilst his tongue ceased not to call upon Almighty Allah and say, ""O my God, be gracious to me in Thy decrees and deliver me from this Thine affliction!""[FN#140] And Shawahi went with him charging him by the way how he should speak with the Queen. When he stood before Nur al-Huda, he found that she had donned the chinveil[FN#141]; so he kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam, improvising these two couplets,

""God make thy glory last in joy of life; * Allah confirm the
       &nbsp   boons he deigned bestow:
Thy grace and grandeur may our Lord increase * And aye Th'
       &nbsp    Almighty aid thee o'er thy foe!""

When he ended his verse Nur al-Huda bade the old woman ask him questions before her, that she might hear his answers: so she said to him, ""The Queen returneth thy salam-greeting and saith to thee, 'What is thy name and that of thy country, and what are the names of thy wife and children, on whose account thou art come hither?""' Quoth he, and indeed he had made firm his heart and destiny aided him, ""O Queen of the age and tide and peerless jewel of the epoch and the time, my name is Hasan the fullfilled of sorrow, and my native city is Bassorah. I know not the name of my wife[FN#142] but my children's names are Násir and Mansúr."" When the Queen heard his reply and his provenance, she bespoke him herself and said, ""And whence took she her children?"" He replied, ""O Queen, she took them from the city of Baghdad and the palace of the Caliphate."" Quoth Nur al-Huda, ""And did she say naught to thee at the time she flew away?;"" and quoth he, ""Yes; she said to my mother, 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of severance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth meeting and reunion to see, and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'"" Whereupon Queen Nur al-Huda shook her head and said to him, ""Had she not desired thee she had not said to thy mother this say, and had she not yearned for reunion with thee, never had she bidden thee to her stead nor acquainted thee with her abiding-place."" Rejoined Hasan, ""O mistress of Kings and asylum of prince and pauper, whatso happened I have told thee and have concealed naught thereof, and I take refuge from evil with Allah and with thee; wherefore oppress me not, but have compassion on me and earn recompense and requital for me in the world to come, and aid me to regain my wife and children. Grant me my urgent need and cool mine eyes with my children and help me to the sight of them."" Then he wept and wailed and lamenting his lot recited these two couplets,

""Yea, I will laud thee while the ring-dove moans, * Though fail
       &nbsp    my wish of due and lawful scope:
Ne'er was I whirled in bliss and joys gone by * Wherein I found
       &nbsp    thee not both root and rope.""[FN#143]

The Queen shook her head and bowed it in thought a long time; then, raising it, she said to Hasan (and indeed she was wroth), ""I have ruth on thee and am resolved to show thee in review all the girls in the city and in the provinces of my island; and in case thou know thy wife, I will deliver her to thee; but, an thou know her not and know not her place, I will put thee to death and crucify thee over the old woman's door."" Replied Hasan, ""I accept this from thee, O Queen of the Age, and am content to submit to this thy condition. There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" And he recited these couplets,

""You've roused my desire and remain at rest,— * Waked my wounded
       &nbsp    lids while you slept with zest.
And ye made me a vow ye would not hang back * But your guile when
       &nbsp    you chained me waxt manifest.
I loved you in childhood unknowing Love; * Then slay me not who
       &nbsp     am sore opprest.
Fear ye not from Allah when slaying a friend * Who gazeth on
       &nbsp    stars when folk sleep their best?
By Allah, my kinsmen, indite on my tomb * 'This man was the slave
       &nbsp     of Love's harshest best!'
Haps a noble youth, like me Love's own thrall, * When he sees my
       &nbsp     grave on my name shall call.""

Then Queen Nur al-Huda commanded that not a girl should abide in the city but should come up to the palace and pass in review before Hasan and moreover she bade Shawahi go down in person and bring them up herself. Accordingly all the maidens in the city presented themselves before the Queen, who caused them to go in to Hasan, hundred after hundred, till there was no girl left in the place, but she had shown her to him; yet he saw not his wife amongst them. Then said she to him, ""Seest thou her amongst these?""; and he replied, ""By thy life, O Queen, she is not amongst them."" With this she was sore enraged against him and said to the old woman, ""Go in and bring out all who are in the palace and show them to him."" So she displayed to him every one of the palace-girls, but he saw not his wife among them and said to the Queen, ""By the life of thy head, O Queen, she is not among these."" Whereat the Queen was wroth and cried out at those around her, saying, ""Take him and hale him along, face to earth, and cut off his head, least any adventure himself after him and intrude upon us in our country and spy out our estate by thus treading the soil of our islands."" So they threw him down on his face and dragged him along; then, covering his eyes with his skirt, stood at his head with bared brands awaiting royal permission. Thereupon Shawahi came forward and kissing the ground before the Queen, took the hem of her garment and laid it on her head, saying, ""O Queen, by my claim for fosterage, be not hasty with him, more by token of thy knowledge that this poor wretch is a stranger, who hath adventured himself and suffered what none ever suffered before him, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) preserved him from death, for that his life was ordained to be long. He heard of thine equity and entered thy city and guarded site;[FN#144] wherefore, if thou put him to death, the report will dispread abroad of thee, by means of the travellers, that thou hatest strangers and slayest them. He is in any case at thy mercy and the slain of thy sword, if his wife be not found in thy dominions; and whensoever thou desireth his presence, I can bring him back to thee. Moreover, in very sooth I took him under my protection only of my trust in thy magnanimity through my claim on thee for fosterage, so that I engaged to him that thou wouldst bring him to his desire, for my knowledge of thy justice and quality of mercy. But for this, I had not brought him into thy kingdom; for I said to myself: 'The Queen will take pleasure in looking upon him, and hearing him speak his verses and his sweet discourse and eloquent which is like unto pearls strung on string.' Moreover, he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat; wherefore he hath a claim upon us.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Tenth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade her pages seize Hasan and smite his neck, the old woman, Shawahi, began to reason with her and say, ""Verily he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat, wherefore he hath a claim upon us, the more especially since I promised him to bring him in company with thee; and thou knowest that, parting is a grievous ill and severance hath power to kill, especially separation from children. Now he hath seen all our women, save only thyself; so do thou show him thy face?"" The Queen smiled and said, ""How can he be my husband and have had children by me, that I should show him my face?"" Then she made them bring Hasan before her and when he stood in the presence, she unveiled her face, which when he saw, he cried out with a great cry and fell down fainting. The old woman ceased not to tend him, till he came to himself and as soon as he revived he recited these couplets,

""O breeze that blowest from the land Irak * And from their
       &nbsp     corners whoso cry 'Wak! Wak!'
Bear news of me to friends and say for me * I've tasted
       &nbsp     passion-food of bitter smack.
O dearlings of my love, show grace and ruth * My heart is melted
       &nbsp     for this severance-rack.""

When he ended his verse he rose and looking on the Queen's face, cried out with a great cry, for stress whereof the palace was like to fall upon all therein. Then he swooned away again and the old woman ceased not to tend him till he revived, when she asked him what ailed him and he answered, ""In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Eleventh Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman asked Hasan what ailed him, he answered, ""In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife."" Quoth Nur al-Huda to the old woman, ""Woe to thee, O nurse! This stranger is either Jinn-mad or out of his mind, for he stareth me in the face with wide eyes and saith I am his wife."" Quoth the old woman, ""O Queen, indeed he is excusable; so blame him not, for the saying saith, 'For the lovesick is no remedy and alike are the madman and he.'"" And Hasan wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,

""I sight their track and pine for longing love; * And o'er their
       &nbsp    homesteads weep I and I yearn:
And I pray Heaven who will'ed we should part, * Will deign to
       &nbsp    grant us boon of safe return.""

Then said Hasan to the Queen once more, ""By Allah, thou art not my wife, but thou art the likest of all folk to her!"" Hereupon Nur al-Huda laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her side.[FN#145] Then she said to him, ""O my friend, take thy time and observe me attentively: answer me at thy leisure what I shall ask thee and put away from thee insanity and perplexity and inadvertency for relief is at hand."" Answered Hasan, ""O mistress of Kings and asylum of all princes and paupers, when I looked upon thee, I was distracted, seeing thee to be either my wife or the likest of all folk to her; but now ask me whatso thou wilt."" Quoth she, ""What is it in thy wife that resembleth me?""; and quoth he, ""O my lady, all that is in thee of beauty and loveliness, elegance and amorous grace, such as the symmetry of thy shape and the sweetness of thy speech and the blushing of thy cheeks and the jutting of thy breasts and so forth, all resembleth her and thou art her very self in thy faculty of parlance and the fairness of thy favour and the brilliancy of thy brow.""[FN#146] When the Queen heard this, she smiled and gloried in her beauty and loveliness and her cheeks reddened and her eyes wantoned; then she turned to Shawahi Umm Dawahi and said to her, ""O my mother, carry him back to the place where he tarried with thee and tend him thyself, till I examine into his affair; for, an he be indeed a man of manliness and mindful of friendship and love and affection, it behoveth we help him to win his wish, more by token that he hath sojourned in our country and eaten of our victual, not to speak of the hardships of travel he hath suffered and the travail and horrors he hath undergone. But, when thou hast brought him to thy house, commend him to the care of thy dependents and return to me in all haste; and Allah Almighty willing![FN#147] all shall be well."" Thereupon Shawahi carried him back to her lodging and charged her handmaids and servants and suite wait upon him and bring him all he needed nor fail in what was his due. Then she returned to Queen Nur al-Huda, who bade her don her arms and set out, taking with her a thousand doughty horsemen. So she obeyed and donned her war-gear and having collected the thousand riders reported them ready to the Queen, who bade her march upon the city of the Supreme King, her father, there to alight at the abode of her youngest sister, Manár al-Saná[FN#148] and say to her, ""Clothe thy two sons in the coats of mail which their aunt hath made them and send them to her; for she longeth for them."" Moreover the Queen charged her keep Hasan's affair secret and say to Manar al-Sana, after securing her children, ""Thy sister inviteth thee to visit her."" ""Then,"" she continued, ""bring the children to me in haste and let her follow at her leisure. Do thou come by a road other than her road and journey night and day and beware of discovering this matter to any. And I swear by all manner oaths that, if my sister prove to be his wife and it appear that her children are his, I will not hinder him from taking her and them and departing with them to his own country.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twelfth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Oueen said, ""I swear by Allah and by all manner of oaths that if she prove to be his wife, I will not hinder him from taking her but will aid him thereto and eke to departing with them to his mother-land."" And the old woman put faith in her words, knowing not what she purposed in her mind, for the wicked Jezebel had resolved that if she were not his wife she would slay him; but if the children resembled him, she would believe him. The Queen resumed, ""O my mother, an my thought tell me true, my sister Manar al-Sana is his wife, but Allah alone is All-knowing! seeing that these traits of surpassing beauty and excelling grace, of which he spoke, are found in none except my sisters and especially in the youngest."" The old woman kissed her hand and returning to Hasan, told him what the Queen had said, whereat he was like to fly for joy and coming up to her, kissed her head. Quoth she, ""O my son, kiss not my head, but kiss me on the mouth and be this kiss by way of sweetmeat for thy salvation.[FN#149] Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and grudge not to kiss my mouth, for I and only I was the means of thy foregathering with her. So take comfort, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and gladden thy glance and console thy soul for, Allah willing, thy desire shall be accomplished at my hand."" So saying, she bade him farewell and departed, whilst he recited these two couplets,

""Witnesses unto love of thee I've four; * And wants each case two
       &nbsp    witnesses; no more!
A heart aye fluttering, limbs that ever quake, * A wasted frame
       &nbsp   and tongue that speech forswore.""

And also these two,

""Two things there be, an blood-tears thereover * Wept eyes till
       &nbsp   not one trace thou couldst discover,
Eyes ne'er could pay the tithe to them is due * The prime of
       &nbsp   youth and severance from lover.""

Then the old woman armed herself and, taking with her a thousand weaponed horsemen, set out and journeyed till she came to the island and the city where dwelt the Lady Manar al-Sana and between which and that of her sister Queen Nur al-Huda was three days' journey. When Shawahi reached the city, she went in to the Princess and saluting her, gave her her sister's salam and acquainted her with the Queen's longing for her and her children and that she reproached her for not visiting her. Quoth Manar al-Sana, ""Verily, I am beholden to my sister and have failed of my duty to her in not visiting her, but I will do so forthright."" Then she bade pitch her tents without the city and took with her for her sister a suitable present of rare things. Presently, the King her father looked out of a window of his palace, and seeing the tents pitched by the road, asked of them, and they answered him, ""The Princess Manar al-Sana hath pitched her tents by the way-side, being minded to visit her sister Queen Nur al-Huda."" When the King heard this, he equipped troops to escort her to her sister and brought out to her from his treasuries meat and drink and monies and jewels and rarities which beggar description. Now the King had seven daughters, all sisters-german by one mother and father except the youngest: the eldest was called Núr al-Hudà, the second Najm al-Sabáh, the third Shams al-Zuhà, the fourth Shajarat al-Durr, the fifth Kút al-Kulúb, the sixth Sharaf al-Banát and the youngest Manar al-Sana, Hasan's wife, who was their sister by the father's side only.[FN#150] Anon the old woman again presented herself and kissed ground before the Princess, who said to her, ""Hast thou any need, O my mother?"" Quoth Shawahi, ""Thy sister, Queen Nur al-Huda, biddeth thee clothe thy sons in the two habergeons which she fashioned for them and send them to her by me, and I will take them and forego thee with them and be the harbinger of glad tidings and the announcer of thy coming to her."" When the Princess heard these words, her colour changed and she bowed her head a long while, after which she shook it and looking up, said to the old woman, ""O my mother, my vitals tremble and my heart fluttereth when thou namest my children; for, from the time of their birth none hath looked on their faces either Jinn or man, male or female, and I am jealous for them of the zephyr when it breatheth in the night."" Exclaimed the old woman, ""What words are these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to the Princess Manar al-Sana, ""What words be these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister? Allah safeguard thy reason! Thou mayst not cross the Queen's majesty in this matter, for she would be wroth with thee. However, O my lady, the children are young, and thou art excusable in fearing for them, for those that love well are wont to deem ill: but, O my daughter, thou knowest my tenderness and mine affection for thee and thy children, for indeed I reared thee before them. I will take them in my charge and make my cheek their pillow and open my heart and set them within, nor is it needful to charge me with care of them in the like of this case; so be of cheerful heart and tearless eye and send them to her, for, at the most, I shall but precede thee with them a day or at most two days."" And she ceased not to urge her, till she gave way, fearing her sister's fury and unknowing what lurked for her in the dark future, and consented to send them with the old woman. So she called them and bathed them and equipped them and changed their apparel. Then she clad them in the two little coats of mail and delivered them to Shawahi, who took them and sped on with them like a bird, by another road than that by which their mother should travel, even as the Queen had charged her; nor did she cease to fare on with all diligence, being fearful for them, till she came in sight of Nur al-Huda's city, when she crossed the river and entering the town, carried them in to their aunt. The Queen rejoiced at their sight and embraced them, and pressed them to her breast; after which she seated them, one upon the right thigh and the other upon the left; and turning round said to the old woman, ""Fetch me Hasan forthright, for I have granted him my safeguard and have spared him from my sabre and he hath sought asylum in my house and taken up his abode in my courts, after having endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks, each terribler than other; yet hitherto is he not safe from drinking the cup of death and from cutting off his breath."" —And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade the old woman bring Hasan she said, ""Verily he hath endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks each terribler than other; yet hitherto he is not safe from death and from the cutting off of his breath."" Replied Shawahi, ""An I bring him to thee, wilt thou reunite him with these his children? Or, if they prove not his, wilt thou pardon him and restore him to his own country?"" Hearing these her words the Queen waxed exceeding wroth and cried to her, ""Fie upon thee, O ill-omened old woman! How long wilt thou false us in the matter of this strange man who hath dared to intrude himself upon us and hath lifted our veil and pried into our conditions? Say me: thinkest thou that he shall come to our land and look upon our faces and betray our honour, and after return in safety to his own country and expose our affairs to his people, wherefore our report will be bruited abroad among all the Kings of the quarters of the earth and the merchants will journey bearing tidings of us in all directions, saying, 'A mortal entered the Isles of Wak and traversed the Land of the Jinn and the lands of the Wild Beasts and the Islands of Birds and set foot in the country of the Warlocks and the Enchanters and returned in safety?' This shall never be; no, never; and I swear by Him who made the Heavens and builded them; yea, by Him who dispread the earth and smoothed it, and who created all creatures and counted them, that, an they be not his children, I will assuredly slay him and strike his neck with mine own hand!"" Then she cried out at the old woman, who fell down for fear; and set upon her the Chamberlain and twenty Mamelukes, saying, ""Go with this crone and fetch me in haste the youth who is in her house."" So they dragged Shawahi along, yellow with fright and with side-muscles quivering, till they came to her house, where she went in to Hasan, who rose to her and kissed her hands and saluted her. She returned not his salam, but said to him, ""Come; speak the Queen. Did I not say to thee: 'Return presently to thine own country and I will give thee that to which no mortal may avail?' And did I forbid thee from all this? But thou wouldst not obey me nor listen to my words; nay, thou rejectedst my counsel and chosest to bring destruction on me and on thyself. Up, then, and take that which thou hast chosen; for death is near hand. Arise: speak with yonder vile harlot[FN#151] and tyrant that she is!"" So Hasan arose, broken-spirited, heavy, hearted, and full of fear, and crying, ""O Preserver, preserve Thou me! O my God, be gracious to me in that which Thou hast decreed to me of Thine affliction and protect me, O Thou the most Merciful of the Mercifuls!"" Then, despairing of his life, he followed the twenty Mamelukes, the Chamberlain and the crone to the Queen's presence, where he found his two sons Nasir and Mansur sitting in her lap, whilst she played and made merry with them. As soon as his eyes fell on them, he knew them and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting for excess of joy at the sight of his children.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Fifteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan's eyes fell upon his two sons, he knew them both and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting. They also knew him[FN#152] and natural affection moved them so that they freed themselves from the Queen's lap and fell upon Hasan, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) made them speak and say to him, ""O our father!"" Whereupon the old woman and all who were present wept for pity and tenderness over them and said, ""Praised be Allah, who hath reunited you with your Sire!"" Presently, Hasan came to himself and embracing his children, wept till again he swooned away, and when he revived, he recited these verses,

""By rights of you, this heart of mine could ne'er aby * Severance
       &nbsp   from you albeit Union death imply!
Your phantom saith to me, 'A-morrow we shall meet!' * Shall I
       &nbsp  despite the foe the morrow-day espy?
By rights of you I swear, my lords, that since the day * Of
       &nbsp  severance ne'er the sweets of lips enjoyèd I!
An Allah bade me perish for the love of you, * Mid greatest
       &nbsp  martyrs for your love I lief will die.
Oft a gazelle doth make my heart her browsing stead * The while
       &nbsp    her form of flesh like sleep eludes mine eye:
If in the lists of Law my bloodshed she deny, * Prove it two
       &nbsp    witnesses those cheeks of ruddy dye.""

When Nur al-Huda was assured that the little ones were indeed Hasan's children and that her sister, the Princess Manar al-Sana, was his wife, of whom he was come in quest, she was wroth against her with wrath beyond measure.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Sixteenth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Huda was certified that the little ones were Hasan's children and that her sister Manar al-Sana was his wife of whom he had come in quest, she raged with exceeding rage, too great to be assuaged and screamed in Hasan's face and reviled him and kicked him in the breast, so that he fell on his back in a swoon. Then she cried out at him, saying, ""Arise! fly for thy life. But that I swore that no evil should betide thee from me, should thy tale prove true, I would slay thee with mine own hand forthright!"" And she cried out at the old woman, who fell on her face for fear, and said to her, ""By Allah, but that I am loath to break the oath that I swore, I would put both thee and him to death after the foulest fashion!""; presently adding, ""Arise, go out from before me in safety and return to thine own country, for I swear by my fortune, if ever mine eye espy thee or if any bring thee in to me after this, I will smite off thy head and that of whoso bringeth thee!"" Then she cried out to her officers, saying, ""Put him out from before me!"" So they thrust him out, and when he came to himself, he recited these couplets,

""You're far, yet to my heart you're nearest near; * Absent yet
       &nbsp    present in my sprite you appear:
By Allah, ne'er to other I've inclined * But tyranny of Time in
       &nbsp    patience bear!
Nights pass while still I love you and they end, * And burns my
       &nbsp    breast with flames of fell Sa'ir;[FN#153]
I was a youth who parting for an hour * Bore not, then what of
       &nbsp    months that make a year?
Jealous am I of breeze-breath fanning thee; * Yea jealous-mad of
       &nbsp    fair soft-sided fere!""

Then he once more fell down in a swoon, and when he came to himself, he found himself without the palace whither they had dragged him on his face; so he rose, stumbling over his skirts and hardly crediting his escape from Nur al-Huda. Now this was grievous to Shawahi; but she dared not remonstrate with the Queen by reason of the violence of her wrath. And forthright Hasan went forth, distracted and knowing not whence to come or whither to go; the world, for all its wideness, was straitened upon him and he found none to speak a kind word with him and comfort him, nor any to whom he might resort for counsel or to apply for refuge; wherefore he made sure of death for that he could not journey to his own country and knew none to travel with him, neither wist he the way thither nor might he pass through the Wady of the Jann and the Land of Beasts and the Islands of Birds. So giving himself up for lost he bewept himself, till he fainted, and when he revived, he bethought him of his children and his wife and of that might befal her with her sister, repenting him of having come to those countries and of having hearkened to none, and recited these couplets,

""Suffer mine eye-babes weep lost of love and tears express: *
       &nbsp   Rare is my solace and increases my distress:
The cup of Severance-chances to the dregs I've drained; * Who is
       &nbsp   the man to bear love-loss with manliness?
Ye spread the Carpet of Disgrace[FN#154] betwixt us twain; * Ah,
       &nbsp   when shalt be uprolled, O Carpet of Disgrace?
I watched the while you slept; and if you deemed that I * Forgot
       &nbsp   your love I but forget forgetfulness:
Woe's me! indeed my heart is pining for the love * Of you, the
       &nbsp     only leaches who can cure my case:
See ye not what befel me from your fell disdain? * Debased am I
       &nbsp     before the low and high no less.
I hid my love of you but longing laid it bare, * And burns my
       &nbsp     heart wi' fire of passion's sorest stress:
Ah! deign have pity on my piteous case, for I * Have kept our
       &nbsp     troth in secresy and patent place!
Would Heaven I wot shall Time e'er deign us twain rejoin! * You
       &nbsp     are my heart's desire, my sprite's sole happiness:
My vitals bear the Severance-wound: would Heaven that you * With
       &nbsp     tidings from your camp would deign my soul to bless!""

Then he went on, till he came without the city, where he found the river, and walked along its bank, knowing not whither he went. Such was Hasan's case; but as regards his wife Manar al-Sana, as she was about to carry out her purpose and to set out, on the second day after the departure of the old woman with her children, behold, there came in to her one of the chamberlains of the King her sire, and kissed ground between his hands,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Seventeenth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Manar al-Sana was about to set out upon the journey, behold, a chamberlain of the King, her sire, came in to her and kissing the ground before her, said, ""O Princess, the Supreme King, thy father saluteth thee and biddeth thee to him."" So she rose and accompanied the chamberlain to learn what was required by her father, who seated her by his side on the couch, and said to her, ""O my daughter, know that I have this night had a dream which maketh me fear for thee and that long sorrow will betide thee from this thy journey."" Quoth she, ""How so, O my father, and what didst thou see in thy dream?"" and quoth he, ""I dreamt that I entered a hidden hoard, wherein was great store of monies, of jewels, of jacinths and of other riches; but 'twas as if naught pleased me of all this treasure and jewelry save seven bezels, which were the finest things there. I chose out one of the seven jewels, for it was the smallest, finest and most lustrous of them and its water pleased me; so I took it in my hand-palm and fared forth of the treasury. When I came without the door, I opened my hand, rejoicing, and turned over the jewel, when, behold, there swooped down on me out of the welkin a strange bird from a far land (for it was not of the birds of our country) and, snatching it from my hand, returned with it whence it came.[FN#155] Whereupon sorrow and concern and sore vexation overcame me and my exceeding chagrin so troubled me that I awoke, mourning and lamenting for the loss of the jewel. At once on awaking I summoned the interpreters and expounders of dreams and declared to them my dream,[FN#156] and they said to me: 'Thou hast seven daughters, the youngest of whom thou wilt lose, and she will be taken from thee perforce, without thy will.' Now thou, O my girl, art the youngest and dearest of my daughters and the most affectionate of them to me, and look'ye thou art about to journey to thy sister, and I know not what may befal thee from her; so go thou not; but return to thy palace."" But when the Princess heard her father's words, her heart fluttered and she feared for her children and bent earthwards her head awhile: then she raised it and said to her sire, ""O King, Queen Nur al-Huda hath made ready for me an entertainment and awaiteth my coming to her, hour by hour. These four years she hath not seen me and if I delay to visit her, she will be wroth with me. The utmost of my stay with her shall be a month and then I will return to thee. Besides, who is the mortal who can travel our land and make his way to the Islands of Wak? Who can gain access to the White Country and the Black Mountain and come to the Land of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal, and how shall he traverse the Island of Birds and the Wady of Wild Beasts and the Valley of the Jann and enter our Islands? If any stranger came hither, he would be drowned in the seas of destruction: so be of good cheer and eyes without a tear anent my journey; for none may avail to tread our earth."" And she ceased not to persuade him, till he deigned give her leave to depart.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighteenth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princess ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart, and bade a thousand horse escort her to the river and abide there, till she entered her sister's city and palace and returned to them, when they should take her and carry her back to him. Moreover, he charged her tarry with her sister but two days and return to him in haste; and she answered, ""Hearing and obedience."" Then rising up she went forth and he with her and farewelled her. Now his words had sunken deep into her heart and she feared for her children; but it availeth not to fortify herself by any device against the onset of Destiny. So she set out and fared on diligently three days, till she came to the river and pitched her tents on its bank. Then she crossed the stream, with some of her counsellors, pages and suite and, going up to the city and the palace, went in to Queen Nur al-Huda, with whom she found her children who ran to her weeping and crying out, ""O our father!"" At this, the tears railed from her eyes and she wept; then she strained them to her bosom, saying, ""What! Have you seen your sire at this time? Would the hour had never been, in which I left him! If I knew him to be in the house of the world, I would carry you to him."" Then she bemoaned herself and her husband and her children weeping and reciting these couplets,

""My friends, despight this distance and this cruelty, * I pine
       &nbsp    for you, incline to you where'er you be.
My glance for ever turns toward your hearth and home * And mourns
       &nbsp    my heart the bygone days you woned with me,
How many a night foregathered we withouten fear * One loving,
       &nbsp   other faithful ever, fain and free!""

When her sister saw her fold her children to her bosom, saying, ""'Tis I who have done thus with myself and my children and have ruined my own house!"" she saluted her not, but said to her, ""O whore, whence haddest thou these children? Say, hast thou married unbeknown to thy sire or hast thou committed fornication?[FN#157] An thou have played the piece, it behoveth thou be exemplarily punished; and if thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from thy sire and bring them hither?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Nineteenth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Nur al-Huda, the Queen, to her sister Manar al-Sana, the Princess, ""An thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from their sire and bring them to our land? Thou hast hidden thy children from us. Thinkest thou we know not of this? Allah Almighty, He who is cognisant of the concealed, hath made known to us thy case and revealed thy condition and bared thy nakedness."" Then she bade her guards seize her and pinion her elbows and shackle her with shackles of iron. So they did as she commanded and she beat her with a grievous beating, so that her skin was torn, and hanged her up by the hair; after which she cast her in prison and wrote the King her father a writ acquainting him with her case and saying, ""There hath appeared in our land a man, a mortal, by name Hasan, and our sister Manar al-Sana avoucheth that she is lawfully married to him and bare him two sons, whom she hath hidden from us and thee; nor did she discover aught of herself till there came to us this man and informed us that he wedded her and she tarried with him a long while; after which she took her children and departed, without his knowledge, bidding as she went his mother tell her son, whenas longing began to rack to come to her in the Islands of Wak. So we laid hands on the man and sent the old woman Shawahi to fetch her and her offspring, enjoining her to bring us the children in advance of her. And she did so, whilst Manar al-Sana equipped herself and set out to visit me. When the boys were brought to me and ere the mother came, I sent for Hasan the mortal who claimeth her to wife, and he on entering and at first sight knew them and they knew him; whereby was I certified that the children were indeed his children and that she was his wife and I learned that the man's story was true and he was not to blame, but that the reproach and the infamy rested with my sister. Now I feared the rending of our honour-veil before the folk of our Isles; so when this wanton, this traitress, came in to me, I was incensed against her and cast her into prison and bastinado'd her grievously and hanged her up by the hair. Behold, I have acquainted thee with her case and it is thine to command, and whatso thou orderest us that we will do. Thou knowest that in this affair is dishonour and disgrace to our name and to thine, and haply the islanders will hear of it, and we shall become amongst them a byword; wherefore it befitteth thou return us an answer with all speed."" Then she delivered the letter to a courier and he carried it to the King, who, when he read it, was wroth with exceeding wrath with his daughter Manar al-Sana and wrote to Nur al-Huda, saying, ""I commit her case to thee and give thee command over her life; so, if the matter be as thou sayest, kill her without consulting me."" When the Queen had received and read her father's letter, she sent for Manar al-Sana and they set before her the prisoner drowned in her blood and pinioned with her hair, shackled with heavy iron shackles and clad in hair-cloth; and they made her stand in the presence abject and abashed. When she saw herself in this condition of passing humiliation and exceeding abjection, she called to mind her former high estate and wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,

""O Lord my foes are fain to slay me in despight * Nor deem I
       &nbsp     anywise to find escape by flight:
I have recourse to Thee t' annul what they have done; * Thou art
       &nbsp     th' asylum, Lord, of fearful suppliant wight.""

Then wept she grievously, till she fell down in a swoon, and presently coming to herself, repeated these two couplets,[FN#158]

""Troubles familiar with my heart are grown and I with them, *
       &nbsp     Erst shunning; for the generous are sociable still.
Not one mere kind alone of woe doth lieger with me lie; * Praised
       &nbsp     be God! There are with me thousands of kinds of ill.""

And also these,

""Oft times Mischance shall straiten noble breast * With grief,
       &nbsp     whence issue is for Him to shape:
But when the meshes straitest, tightest, seem * They loose,
       &nbsp     though deemed I ne'er to find escape.""

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twentieth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda ordered into the presence her sister Princess Manar al-Sana, they set her between her hands and she, pinioned as she was recited the verses aforesaid. Then the Queen[FN#159] sent for a ladder of wood and made the eunuchs lay her on her back, with her arms spread out and bind her with cords thereto; after which she bared her head and wound her hair about the ladder-rungs and indeed all pity for her was rooted out from her heart. When Manar al-Sana saw herself in this state of abjection and humiliation, she cried out and wept; but none succoured her. Then said she to the Queen, ""O my sister, how is thy heart hardened against me? Hast thou no mercy on me nor pity on these little children?"" But her words only hardened her sister's heart and she insulted her, saying, ""O Wanton! O harlot! Allah have no ruth on whoso sueth for thee! How should I have compassion on thee, O traitress?"" Replied Manar al-Sana who lay stretched on the ladder, ""I appeal from thee to the Lord of the Heavens, concerning that wherewith thou revilest me and whereof I am innocent! By Allah, I have done no whoredom, but am lawfully married to him, and my Lord knoweth an I speak sooth or not! Indeed, my heart is wroth with thee, by reason of thine excessive hardheartedness against me! How canst thou cast at me the charge of harlotry, without knowledge? But my Lord will deliver me from thee and if that whoredom whereof thou accusest me be true, may He presently punish me for it!"" Quoth Nur al-Huda after a few moments of reflection ""How durst thou bespeak me thus?"" and rose and beat her till she fainted away;[FN#160] whereupon they sprinkled water on her face till she revived; and in truth her charms were wasted for excess of beating and the straitness of her bonds and the sore insults she had suffered. Then she recited these two couplets,

""If aught I've sinned in sinful way, * Or done ill deed and gone
astray,
The past repent I and I come * To you and for your pardon pray!""
When Nur al-Huda heard these lines, her wrath redoubled and she said to her, ""Wilt speak before me in verse, O whore, and seek to excuse thyself for the mortal sins thou hast sinned? 'Twas my desire that thou shouldst return to thy husband, that I might witness thy wickedness and matchless brazenfacedness; for thou gloriest in thy lewdness and wantonness and mortal heinousness."" Then she called for a palm-stick and, whenas they brought the Jaríd, she arose and baring arms to elbows, beat her sister from head to foot; after which she called for a whip of plaited thongs, wherewith if one smote an elephant, he would start off at full speed, and came down therewith on her back and her stomach and every part of her body, till she fainted. When the old woman Shawahi saw this, she fled forth from the Queen's presence, weeping and cursing her; but Nur al-Huda cried out to her eunuchs, saying, ""Fetch her to me!"" So they ran after her and seizing her, brought her back to the Queen, who bade throw her on the ground and making them lay hold of her, rose and took the whip, with which she beat her, till she swooned away, when she said to her waiting-women, ""Drag this ill-omened beldam forth on her face and put her out."" And they did as she bade them. So far concerning them; but as regards Hasan, he walked on beside the river, in the direction of the desert, distracted, troubled, and despairing of life; and indeed he was dazed and knew not night from day for stress of affliction. He ceased not faring on thus, till he came to a tree whereto he saw a scroll hanging: so he took it and found written thereon these couplets,

""When in thy mother's womb thou wast, * I cast thy case the
       &nbsp   bestest best;
And turned her heart to thee, so she * Fosterèd thee on fondest
       &nbsp    breast.
We will suffice thee in whate'er * Shall cause thee trouble or
       &nbsp   unrest;
We'll aid thee in thine enterprise * So rise and bow to our
       &nbsp  behest.""

When he had ended reading this scroll, he made sure of deliverance from trouble and of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a few steps and found himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein there was none to company with him; upon which his heart sank within him for horror and loneliness and his side-muscles trembled, for that fearsome place, and he recited these couplets,

""O Zephyr of Morn, an thou pass where the dear ones dwell, * Bear
       &nbsp   greeting of lover who ever in love-longing wones!
And tell them I'm pledged to yearning and pawned to pine * And
       &nbsp    the might of my passion all passion of lovers unthrones.
Their sympathies haply shall breathe in a Breeze like thee * And
       &nbsp    quicken forthright this framework of rotting bones.""[FN#161]

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-first Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan read the scroll he was certified of deliverance from his trouble and made sure of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a couple of steps and stopped finding himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein was none to company with him, so he wept sore and recited the verses before mentioned. Then he walked on a few steps farther beside the river, till he came upon two little boys of the sons of the sorcerers, before whom lay a rod of copper graven with talismans, and beside it a skull-cap[FN#162] of leather, made of three gores and wroughten in steel with names and characts. The cap and rod were upon the ground and the boys were disputing and beating each other, till the blood ran down between them; whilst each cried, ""None shall take the wand but I."" So Hasan interposed and parted them, saying, ""What is the cause of your contention?"" and they replied, ""O uncle, be thou judge of our case, for Allah the Most High hath surely sent thee to do justice between us."" Quoth Hasan, ""Tell me your case, and I will judge between you;"" and quoth one of them, ""We twain are brothers-german and our sire was a mighty magician, who dwelt in a cave on yonder mountain. He died and left us this cap and rod; and my brother saith, 'None shall have the rod but I,' whilst I say the like; so be thou judge between us and deliver us each from other."" Hasan asked, ""What is the difference between the rod and the cap and what is their value? The rod appears to be worth six coppers[FN#163] and the cap three;"" whereto they answered, ""Thou knowest not their properties."" ""And what are their properties?"" ""Each of them hath a wonderful secret virtue, wherefore the rod is worth the revenue of all the Islands of Wak and their provinces and dependencies, and the cap the like!"" ""By Allah, O my sons, discover to me their secret virtues."" So they said, ""O uncle, they are extraordinary; for our father wrought an hundred and thirty and five years at their contrivance, till he brought them to perfection and ingrafted them with secret attributes which might serve him extraordinary services and engraved them after the likeness of the revolving sphere, and by their aid he dissolved all spells; and when he had made an end of their fashion, Death, which all needs must suffer, overtook him. Now the hidden virtue of the cap is, that whoso setteth it on his head is concealed from all folks' eyes, nor can any see him, whilst it remaineth on his head; and that of the rod is that whoso owneth it hath authority over seven tribes of the Jinn, who all serve the order and ordinance of the rod; and whenever he who possesseth it smiteth therewith on the ground, their Kings come to do him homage, and all the Jinn are at his service."" Now when Hasan heard these words, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then said in himself, ""By Allah, I shall conquer every foe by means of this rod and cap, Inshallah! and I am worthier of them both than these two boys. So I will go about forthright to get them from the twain by craft, that I may use them to free myself and my wife and children from yonder tyrannical Queen, and then we will depart from this dismal stead, whence there is no deliverance for mortal man nor flight. Doubtless, Allah caused me not to fall in with these two lads, but that I might get the rod and cap from them."" Then he raised his head and said to the two boys, ""If ye would have me decide the case, I will make trial of you and see what each of you deserveth. He who overcometh his brother shall have the rod and he who faileth shall have the cap."" They replied,""'O uncle, we depute thee to make trial of us and do thou decide between us as thou deems fit."" Hasan asked, ""Will ye hearken to me and have regard to my words?""; and they answered, ""Yes."" Then said he, ""I will take a stone and throw it and he who outrunneth his brother thereto and picketh it up shall take the rod, and the other who is outraced shall take the cap."" And they said, ""We accept and consent to this thy proposal."" Then Hasan took a stone and threw it with his might, so that it disappeared from sight. The two boys ran under and after it and when they were at a distance, he donned the cap and hending the rod in hand, removed from his place that he might prove the truth of that which the boys had said, with regard to their scant properties. The younger outran the elder and coming first to the stone, took it and returned with it to the place where they had left Hasan, but found no signs of him. So he called to his brother, saying, ""Where is the man who was to be umpire between us?"" Quoth the other, ""I espy him not neither wot I whether he hath flown up to heaven above or sunk into earth beneath."" Then they sought for him, but saw him not, though all the while he was standing in his stead hard by them. So they abused each other, saying, ""Rod and Cap are both gone; they are neither mine nor thine: and indeed our father warned us of this very thing; but we forgot whatso he said."" Then they retraced their steps and Hasan also entered the city, wearing the cap and bearing the rod; and none saw him. Now when he was thus certified of the truth of their speech, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and making the palace, went up into the lodging of Shawahi, who saw him not, because of the cap. Then he walked up to a shelf[FN#164] over her head upon which were vessels of glass and chinaware, and shook it with his hand, so that what was thereon fell to the ground. The old woman cried out and beat her face; then she rose and restored the fallen things to their places,[FN#165] saying in herself, ""By Allah, methinks Queen Nur al-Huda hath sent a Satan to torment me, and he hath tricked me this trick! I beg Allah Almighty, deliver me from her and preserve me from her wrath, for, O Lord, if she deal thus abominably with her half-sister, beating and hanging her, dear as she is to her sire, how will she do with a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-second Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the ancient Lady of Calamities cried, ""When Queen Nur al-Huda doeth such misdeed to her sister, what will she do to a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?"" Then said she, ""I conjure thee, O devil, by the Most Compassionate, the Bountiful-great, the High of Estate, of Dominion Elate who man and Jinn did create, and by the writing upon the seal of Solomon David-son (on both be the Peace!) speak to me and answer me;"" Quoth Hasan, ""I am no devil; I am Hasan, the afflicted, the distraught."" Then he raised the cap from his head and appeared to the old woman, who knew him and taking him apart, said to him, ""What is come to thy reason, that thou returnest hither? Go hide thee; for, if this wicked woman have tormented thy wife with such torments, and she her sister, what will she do, an she light on thee?"" Then she told him all that had befallen his spouse and that wherein she was of travail and torment and tribulation, and straitly described all the pains she endured adding, ""And indeed the Queen repenteth her of having let thee go and hath sent one after thee, promising him an hundred-weight of gold and my rank in her service; and she hath sworn that, if he bring thee back, she will do thee and thy wife and children dead."" And she shed tears and discovered to Hasan what the Queen had done with herself, whereat he wept and said, ""O my lady, how shall I do to escape from this land and deliver myself and my wife and children from this tyrannical Queen and how devise to return with them in safety to my own country?"" Replied the old woman, ""Woe to thee! Save thyself."" Quoth he, ""There is no help but I deliver her and my children from the Queen perforce and in her despite;"" and quoth Shawahi, ""How canst thou forcibly rescue them from her? Go and hide thyself, O my son, till Allah Almighty empower thee."" Then Hasan showed her the rod and the cap, whereat she rejoiced with joy exceeding and cried, ""Glory be to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! By Allah, O my son, thou and thy wife were but of lost folk; now, however, thou art saved, thou and thy wife and children! For I know the rod and I know its maker, who was my Shaykh in the science of Gramarye. He was a mighty magician and spent an hundred and thirty and five years working at this rod and cap, till he brought them to perfection, when Death the Inevitable overtook him. And I have heard him say to his two boys, 'O my sons, these two things are not of your lot, for there will come a stranger from a far country, who will take them from you by force, and ye shall not know how he taketh them.' Said they, 'O our father, tell us how he will avail to take them.' But he answered, 'I wot not.' And O my son,"" added she, ""how availedst thou to take them?"" So he told her how he had taken them from the two boys, whereat she rejoiced and said, ""O my son, since thou hast gotten the whereby to free thy wife and children, give ear to what I shall say to thee. For me there is no woning with this wicked woman, after the foul fashion in which she durst use me; so I am minded to depart from her to the caves of the Magicians and there abide with them until I die. But do thou, O my son, don the cap and hend the rod in hand and enter the place where thy wife and children are. Unbind her bonds and smite the earth with the rod saying, 'Be ye present, O servants of these names!' whereupon the servants of the rod will appear; and if there present himself one of the Chiefs of the Tribes, command him whatso thou shalt wish and will."" So he farewelled her and went forth, donning the cap and hending the rod, and entered the place where his wife was. He found her well-nigh lifeless, bound to the ladder by her hair, tearful-eyed and woeful-hearted, in the sorriest of plights, knowing no way to deliver herself. Her children were playing under the ladder, whilst she looked at them and wept for them and herself, because of the barbarities and sore treatings and bitter penalties which had befallen her; and he heard her repeat these couplets[FN#166],

""There remained not aught save a fluttering, breath and an eye
       &nbsp    whose owner is confounded.
And a desirous lover whose bowels are burned with fire
       &nbsp     notwithstanding which she is silent.
The exulting foe pitieth her at the sight of her. Alas for her
       &nbsp     whom the exulting foe pitieth!""

When Hasan saw her in this state of torment and misery and ignominy and infamy, he wept till he fainted; and when he recovered he saw his children playing and their mother aswoon for excess of pain; so he took the cap from his head and the children saw him and cried out, ""O our father!"" Then he covered his head again and the Princess came to herself, hearing their cry, but saw only her children weeping and shrieking, ""O our father!"" When she heard them name their sire and weep, her heart was broken and her vitals rent asunder and she said to them, ""What maketh you in mind of your father at this time?"" And she wept sore and cried out, from a bursten liver and an aching bosom, ""Where are ye and where is your father?"" Then she recalled the days of her union with Hasan and what had befallen her since her desertion of him and wept with sore weeping till her cheeks were seared and furrowed and her face was drowned in a briny flood. Her tears ran down and wetted the ground and she had not a hand loose to wipe them from her cheeks, whilst the flies fed their fill on her skin, and she found no helper but weeping and no solace but improvising verses. Then she repeated these couplets,

""I call to mind the parting-day that rent our loves in twain,
       &nbsp     When, as I turned away, the tears in very streams did rain.
The cameleer urged on his beasts with them, what while I found
       &nbsp    Nor strength nor fortitude, nor did my heart with me remain.
Yea, back I turned, unknowing of the road nor might shake off The
       &nbsp    trance of grief and longing love that numbed my heart and
       &nbsp    brain;
And worst of all betided me, on my return, was one Who came to
       &nbsp    me, in lowly guise, to glory in my pain.
Since the belovèd's gone, O soul, forswear the sweet of life Nor
       &nbsp     covet its continuance, for, wanting him, 'twere vain.
List, O my friend, unto the tale of love, and God forbid That I
       &nbsp     should speak and that thy heart to hearken should not deign!
As 'twere El Asmaï himself, of passion I discourse Fancies rare
       &nbsp     and marvellous, linked in an endless chain.""[FN#167]

—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-third Night,

She continued, When Hasan went in to his wife he saw his children and heard her repeating the verses afore mentioned.[FN#168] Then she turned right and left, seeking the cause of her children's crying out, ""O our father!"" but saw no one and marvelled that her sons should name their sire at that time and call upon him. But when Hasan heard her verses, he wept till he swooned away and the tears railed down his cheeks like rain. Then he drew near the children and raised the cap from his head unseen of his wife, whereupon they saw him and they knew him and cried out, saying, ""O our father!"" Their mother fell a-weeping again, when she heard them name their sire's name and said, ""There is no avoiding the doom which Almighty Allah hath decreed!"" adding, ""O Strange! What garreth them think of their father at this time and call upon him, albeit it is not of their wont?"" Then she wept and recited these couplets,

""The land of lamping moon is bare and drear; * O eyne of me pour
       &nbsp   forth the brimming tear!
They marched: how shall I now be patient? * That I nor heart nor
       &nbsp   patience own I swear!
O ye, who marched yet bide in heart of me, * Will you, O lords of
       &nbsp    me, return to that we were?
What harm if they return and I enjoy * Meeting, and they had ruth
       &nbsp    on tears of care?
Upon the parting-day they dimmed these eyne, * For sad surprise,
       &nbsp    and lit the flames that flare.
Sore longed I for their stay, but Fortune stayed * Longings and
       &nbsp    turned my hope to mere despair.
Return to us (O love!) by Allah, deign! * Enow of tears have
       &nbsp    flowed for absence-bane.""

Then Hasan could no longer contain himself, but took the cap from his head; whereupon his wife saw him and recognising him screamed a scream which startled all in the palace, and said to him, ""How camest thou hither? From the sky hast thou dropped or through the earth hast thou come up?"" And her eyes brimmed with tears and Hasan also wept. Quoth she, ""O man, this be no time for tears or blame. Fate hath had its course and the sight was blinded and the Pen hath run with what was ordained of Allah when Time was begun: so, Allah upon thee, whencesoever thou comest, go hide, lest any espy thee and tell my sister and she do thee and me die!"" Answered he, ""O my lady and lady of all Queens, I have adventured myself and come hither, and either I will die or I will deliver thee from this strait and travel with thee and my children to my country, despite the nose of this thy wickedest sister."" But as she heard his words she smiled and for awhile fell to shaking her head and said, ""Far, O my fife, far is it from the power of any except Allah Almighty to deliver me from this my strait! Save thyself by flight and wend thy ways and cast not thyself into destruction; for she hath conquering hosts none may withstand. Given that thou tookest me and wentest forth, how canst thou make thy country and escape from these islands and the perils of these awesome places? Verily, thou hast seen on thy way hither, the wonders, the marvels, the dangers and the terrors of the road, such as none may escape, not even one of the rebel Jinns. Depart, therefore, forthright and add not cark to my cark and care to my care, neither do thou pretend to rescue me from this my plight; for who shall carry me to thy country through all these vales and thirsty wolds and fatal steads?"" Rejoined Hasan, ""By thy life, O light of mine eyes, I will not depart this place nor fare but with thee!"" Quoth she, ""O man! How canst thou avail unto this thing and what manner of man art thou? Thou knowest not what thou sayest! None can escape from these realms, even had he command over Jinns, Ifrits, magicians, chiefs of tribes and Marids. Save thyself and leave me; perchance Allah will bring about good after ill."" Answered Hasan, ""O lady of fair ones, I came not save to deliver thee with this rod and with this cap."" And he told her what had befallen him with the two boys; but, whilst he was speaking, behold, up came the Queen and heard their speech. Now when he was ware of her, he donned the cap and was hidden from sight, and she entered and said to the Princess, ""O wanton, who is he with whom thou wast talking?"" Answered Manar al-Sanar, ""Who is with me that should talk with me, except these children?"" Then the Quee took the whip and beat her, whilst Hasan stood by and looked on, nor did she leave beating her till she fainted; whereupon she bade transport her to another place. So they loosed her and carried her to another chamber whilst Hasan followed unseen. There they cast her down, senseless, and stood gazing upon her, till she revived and recited these couplets,[FN#169]

""I have sorrowed on account of our disunion with a sorrow that
       &nbsp    made the tears to overflow from my eyelids;
And I vowed that if Fortune reunite us, I would never again
       &nbsp  mention our separation;
And I would say to the envious, Die ye with regret; By Allah I
       &nbsp    have now attained my desire!
Joy hath overwhelmed me to such a degree that by its excess it
       &nbsp    hath made me weep.
O eye, how hath weeping become thy habit? Thou weepest in joy as
       &nbsp   well, as in sorrows.""

When she ceased her verse the slave-girls went out from her and Hasan took off the cap; whereupon his wife said to him, ""See, O man, all this befel me not save by reason of my having rebelled against thee and transgressed thy commandment and gone forth without thy leave.[FN#170] So, Allah upon thee blame me not for my sins and know that women never wot a man's worth till they have lost him. Indeed, I have offended and done evil; but I crave pardon of Allah Almighty for whatso I did, and if He reunite us, I will never again gainsay thee in aught, no, never!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's wife besought pardon of him saying, ""Blame me not for my sin; and indeed I crave mercy of Allah Almighty."" Quoth Hasan (and indeed his heart ached for her), ""'Twas not thou that wast in fault; nay, the fault was mine and mine only, for I fared forth and left thee with one who knew not thy rank, neither thy worth nor thy degree. But know, O beloved of my heart and fruit of my vitals and light of mine eyes, that Allah (blessed be He!) hath ordained to me power of releasing thee; so, say me, wouldst thou have me carry thee to thy father's home, there to accomplish what Allah decreeth unto thee, or wilt thou forthright depart with me to mine own country, now that relief is come to thee?"" Quoth she, ""Who can deliver me save the Lord of the Heavens? Go to thy motherland and put away from thee false hope; for thou knowest not the perils of these parts which, an thou obey me not, soon shalt thou sight."" And she improvised these couplets,

""On me and with me bides thy volunty; * Why then such anger such
       &nbsp   despite to me?
Whate'er befel us Heaven forbid that love * Fade for long time or
       &nbsp  e'er forgotten be!
Ceased not the spy to haunt our sides, till seen * Our love
       &nbsp estranged and then estranged was he:
In truth I trusted to fair thoughts of thine * Though spake the
       &nbsp    wicked spy maliciously.
We'll keep the secret 'twixt us twain and bold * Although the
       &nbsp    brand of blame unsheathed we see.
The livelong day in longing love I spend * Hoping acceptance-
       &nbsp   message from my friend.""

Then wept she and her children, and the handmaidens heard them: so they came in to them and found them weeping, but saw not Hasan with them; wherefore they wept for ruth of them and damned Queen Nur al-Huda. Then Hasan took patience till night came on and her guards had gone to their sleeping-places, when he arose and girded his waist; then went up to her and, loosing her, kissed her on the head and between the eyes and pressed her to his bosom, saying, ""How long have we wearied for our mother-land and for reunion there! Is this our meeting in sleep, or on wake?"" Then he took up the elder boy and she took up the younger and they went forth the palace; and Allah veiled them with the veil of His protection, so that they came safe to the outer gate which closed the entrance to the Queen's Serraglio. But finding it locked from without, Hasan said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily we are Allah's and unto Him shall we return!"" With this they despaired of escape and Hasan beat hand upon hand, saying, ""O Dispeller of dolours! Indeed, I had bethought me of every thing and considered its conclusion but this; and now, when it is daybreak, they will take us, and what device have we in this case?"" And he recited the following two couplets,[FN#171]

""Thou madest fair thy thought of Fate, whenas the days were fair,
       &nbsp  And fearedst not the unknown ills that they to thee might
       &nbsp bring.
The nights were fair and calm to thee; thou wast deceived by
       &nbsp  them, For in the peace of night is born full many a
       &nbsp  troublous thing.""

Then Hasan wept and his wife wept for his weeping and for the abasement she had suffered and the cruelties of Time and Fortune,

""Baulks me my Fate as tho' she were my foe; * Each day she
       &nbsp    showeth me new cark and care:
Fate, when I aim at good, brings clear reverse, * And lets foul
       &nbsp    morrow wait on day that's fair.""
And also these,

""Irks me my Fate and clean unknows that I * Of my high worth her
       &nbsp     shifts and shafts despise.
She nights parading what ill-will she works: * I night parading
       &nbsp     Patience to her eyes.""

Then his wife said to him, ""By Allah, there is no relief for us but to kill ourselves and be at rest from this great and weary travail; else we shall suffer grievous torment on the morrow."" At this moment, behold, they heard a voice from without the door say, ""By Allah, O my lady Manar al-Sana, I will not open to thee and thy husband Hasan, except ye obey me in whatso I shall say to you!"" When they heard these words they were silent for excess of fright and would have returned whence they came; when lo! the voice spake again saying, ""What aileth you both to be silent and answer me not?"" Therewith they knew the speaker for the old woman Shawahi, Lady of Calamities, and said to her, ""Whatsoever thou biddest us, that will we do; but first open the door to us; this being no time for talk."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I will not open to you until ye both swear to me that you will take me with you and not leave me with yonder whore: so, whatever befalleth you shall befal me and if ye escape, I shall escape, and if ye perish, I shall perish: for yonder abominable woman, tribade[FN#172] that she is! entreateth me with indignity and still tormenteth me on your account; and thou, O my daughter, knowest my worth."" Now recognising her they trusted in her and sware to her an oath such as contented her, whereupon she opened the door to them and they fared forth and found her riding on a Greek jar of red earthenware with a rope of palm-fibres about its neck,[FN#173] which rolled under her and ran faster than a Najdi colt, and she came up to them, and said, ""Follow me and fear naught, for I know forty modes of magic by the least of which I could make this city a dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows, and ensorcel each damsel therein to a fish, and all before dawn. But I was not able to work aught of my mischief, for fear of the King her father and of regard to her sisters, for that they are formidable, by reason of their many guards and tribesmen and servants. However, soon will I show you wonders of my skill in witchcraft; and now let us on, relying upon the blessing of Allah and His good aid."" Now Hasan and his wife rejoiced in this, making sure of escape, —And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan and his wife, accompanied by the ancient dame Shawahi, fared forth from the palace, they made sure of deliverance and they walked on till they came without the city, when he fortified his heart and, smiting the earth with the rod, cried, ""Ho, ye servants of these names, appear to me and acquaint me with your conditions!"" Thereupon the earth clave asunder and out came ten[FN#174] Ifrits, with their feet in the bowels of the earth and their heads in the clouds. They kissed the earth three times before Hasan and said as with one voice, ""Adsumus! Here are we at thy service, O our lord and ruler over us! What dost thou bid us do? For we hear and obey thy commandment. An thou wilt, we will dry thee up seas and remove mountains from their places."" So Hasan rejoiced in their words and at their speedy answer to his evocation then taking courage and bracing up his resolution, he said to them, ""Who are ye and what be your names and your races, and to what tribes and clans and companies appertain ye?"" They kissed the earth once more and answered as with one voice, saying, ""We are seven Kings, each ruling over seven tribes of the Jinn of all conditions, and Satans and Marids, flyers and divers, dwellers in mountains and wastes and wolds and haunters of the seas: so bid us do whatso thou wilt; for we are thy servants and thy slaves, and whoso possesseth this rod hath dominion over an our necks and we owe him obedience."" Now when Hasan heard this, he rejoiced with joy exceeding, as did his wife and the old woman, and presently he said to the Kings of the Jinn, ""I desire of you that ye show me your tribes and hosts and guards."" ""O our lord,"" answered they, ""if we show thee our tribes, we fear for thee and these who are with thee, for their name is legion and they are various in form and fashion, figure and favour. Some of us are heads sans bodies and others bodies sans heads, and others again are in the likeness of wild beasts and ravening lions. However, if this be thy will, there is no help but we first show thee those of us who are like unto wild beasts. But, O our lord, what wouldst thou of us at this present?"" Quoth Hasan, ""I would have you carry me forthwith to the city of Baghdad, me and my wife and this honest woman."" But, hearing his words they hung down their heads and were silent, whereupon Hasan asked them, ""Why do ye not reply?"" And they answered as with one voice, ""O our lord and ruler over us, we are of the covenant of Solomon son of David (on the twain be Peace!) and he sware us in that we would bear none of the sons of Adam on our backs; since which time we have borne no mortal on back or shoulder: but we will straightway harness thee horses of the Jinn, that shall carry thee and thy company to thy country."" Hasan enquired, ""How far are we from Baghdad?"" and they, ""Seven years' journey for a diligent horseman."" Hasan marvelled at this and said to them, ""Then how came I hither in less than a year?""; and they said, ""Allah softened to thee the hearts of His pious servants else hadst thou never come to this country nor hadst thou set eyes on these regions; no, never! For the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who mounted thee on the elephant and the magical horse, traversed with thee, in ten days, three years' journey for a well-girt rider, and the Ifrit Dahnash, to whom the Shaykh committed thee, carried thee a three years' march in a day and a night; all which was of the blessing of Allah Almighty, for that the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh is of the seed of Asaf bin Barkhiyá[FN#175] and knoweth the Most Great name of Allah.[FN#176] Moreover, from Baghdad to the palace of the damsels is a year's journey, and this maketh up the seven years."" When Hasan heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and cried, ""Glory be to God, Facilitator of the hard, Fortifier of the weak heart, Approximator of the far and Humbler of every froward tyrant, Who hath eased us of every accident and carried me to these countries and subjected to me these creatures and reunited me with my wife and children! I know not whether I am asleep or awake or if I be sober or drunken!"" Then he turned to the Jinn and asked, ""When ye have mounted me upon your steeds, in how many days will they bring us to Baghdad?""; and they answered, ""They will carry you thither under the year, but not till after ye have endured terrible perils and hardships and horrors and ye have traversed thirsty Wadys and frightful wastes and horrible steads without number; and we cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from the people of these islands,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Jann said to Hasan, ""We cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from this Islandry, nor from the mischief of the Supreme King and his enchanters and warlocks. It may be they will overcome us and take you from us and we fall into affliction with them, and all to whom the tidings shall come after this will say to us: 'Ye are wrong-doers! How could ye go against the Supreme King and carry a mortal out of his dominions, and eke the King's daughter with him?' adding, 'Wert thou alone with us the thing were light; but He who conveyed thee hither is capable to carry thee back to thy country and reunite thee with thine own people forthright and in readiest plight. So take heart and put thy trust in Allah and fear not; for we are at thy service, to convey thee to thy country."" Hasan thanked them therefor and said, ""Allah requite you with good! but now make haste with the horses;"" they replied, ""We hear and we obey,"" and struck the ground with their feet, whereupon it opened and they disappeared within it and were absent awhile, after which they suddenly reappeared with three horses, saddled and bridled, and on each saddle-bow a pair of saddle-bags, with a leathern bottle of water in one pocket and the other full of provaunt. So Hasan mounted one steed and took a child before him, whilst his wife mounted a second and took the other child before her. Then the old woman alighted from the jar and bestrode the third horse and they rode on, without ceasing, all night. At break of day, they turned aside from the road and made for the mountain, whilst their tongues ceased not to name Allah. Then they fared on under the highland all that day, till Hasan caught sight of a black object afar as it were a tall column of smoke a-twisting skywards; so he recited somewhat of the Koran and Holy Writ, and sought refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned. The black thing grew plainer as they drew near, and when hard by it, they saw that it was an Ifrit, with a head like a huge dome and tusks like grapnels and jaws like a lane and nostrils like ewers and ears like leathern targes and mouth like a cave and teeth like pillars of stone and hands like winnowing forks and legs like masts: his head was in the cloud and his feet in the bowels of the earth had plowed. Whenas Hasan gazed upon him he bowed himself and kissed the ground before him, saying, ""O Hasan, have no fear of me; for I am the chief of the dwellers in this land, which is the first of the Isles of Wak, and I am a Moslem and an adorer of the One God. I have heard of you and your coming and when I knew of your case, I desired to depart from the land of the magicians to another land, void of inhabitants and far from men and Jinn, that I might dwell there alone and worship Allah till my fated end came upon me. So I wish to accompany you and be your guide, till ye fare forth of the Wak Islands; and I will not appear save at night; and do ye hearten your hearts on my account; for I am a Moslem, even as ye are Moslems."" When Hasan heard the Ifrit's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and made sure of deliverance; and he said to him, ""Allah requite thee weal! Go with us relying upon the blessing of Allah!"" So the Ifrit forewent them and they followed, talking and making merry, for their hearts were pleased and their breasts were eased and Hasan fell to telling his wife all that had befallen him and all the hardships he had undergone, whilst she excused herself to him and told him, in turn, all she had seen and suffered. They ceased not faring all that night.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they ceased not faring all that night and the horses bore them like the blinding leven, and when the day rose all put their hands to the saddle-bags and took forth provaunt which they ate and water which they drank. Then they sped diligently on their way, preceded by the Ifrit, who turned aside with them from the beaten track into another road, till then untrodden, along the seashores and they ceased not faring on, without stopping, across Wadys and wolds a whole month, till on the thirty-first day there arose before them a dust-cloud, that walled the world and darkened the day; and when Hasan saw this, he was confused and turned pale; and more so when a frightful crying and clamour struck their ears. There, upon the old woman said to him, ""O my son, this is the army of the Wak Islands, that hath overtaken us; and presently they will lay violent hands on us."" Hasan asked, ""What shall I do, O my mother?""; and she answered, ""Strike the earth with the rod."" He did so whereupon the Seven Kings presented themselves and saluted him with the salam, kissing ground before him and saying, ""Fear not neither grieve."" Hasan rejoiced at these words and answered them, saying, ""Well said, O Princes of the Jinn and the Ifrits! This is your time!"" Quoth they, ""Get ye up to the mountain-top, thou and thy wife and children and she who is with thee and leave us to deal with them, for we know that you all are in the right and they in the wrong and Allah will aid us against them."" So Hasan and his wife and children and the old woman dismounted and dismissing the horses, ascended the flank of the mountain.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,

She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his wife, his children and the ancient dame ascended the mountain-flank after they had dismissed the coursers. Presently, up came Queen Nur al-Huda, with the troops right and left, and the captains went round about among the host and ranged them rank by rank in battle array. Then the hosts charged down upon each other and clashed together the twain with a mighty strain, the brave pressed on amain and the coward to fly was fain and the Jinn cast flames of fire from their mouths, whilst the smoke of them rose up to the confines of the sky and the two armies appeared and disappeared. The champions fought and heads flew from trunks and the blood ran in rills; nor did brand leave to play and blood to flow and battle fire to flow, till the murk o' night came, when the two hosts drew apart and, alighting from their steeds rested upon the field by the fires they had kindled. Therewith the Seven Kings went up to Hasan and kissed the earth before him. He pressed forwards to meet them and thanked them and prayed Allah to give them the victory and asked them how they had fared with the Queen's troops. Quoth they, ""They will not withstand us more than three days, for we had the better of them to-day, taking some two thousand of them prisoners and slaying of them much folk whose compt may not be told. So be of good cheer and broad of breast."" Then they farewelled him and went down to look after the safety of their troops; and they ceased not to keep up the fires till the morning rose with its sheen and shone, when the fighting-men mounted their horses of noble strain and smote one another with thin-edged skean and with brawn of bill they thrust amain nor did they cease that day battle to darraign. Moreover, they passed the night on horseback clashing together like dashing seas; raged among them the fires of war and they stinted not from battle and jar, till the armies of Wak were defeated and their power broken and their courage quelled; their feet slipped and whither they fled soever defeat was before them; wherefore they turned tail and of flight began to avail: but the most part of them were slain and their Queen and her chief officers and the grandees of her realm were captive ta'en. When the morning morrowed, the Seven Kings presented themselves before Hasan and set for him a throne of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels, and he sat down thereon. They also set thereby a throne of ivory, plated with glittering gold, for the Princess Manar al-Sana and another for the ancient dame Shawahi Zat al-Dawahi. Then they brought before them the prisoners and among the rest, Queen Nur al-Huda with elbows pinioned and feet fettered, whom when Shawahi saw, she said to her, ""Thy recompense, O harlot, O tyrant, shall be that two bitches be starved and two mares stinted of water, till they be athirst: then shalt thou be bound to the mares' tails and these driven to the river, with the bitches following thee that they may rend thy skin; and after, thy flesh shall be cut off and given them to eat. How couldst thou do with thy sister such deed, O strumpet, seeing that she was lawfully married, after the ordinance of Allah and of His Apostle? For there is no monkery in Al-Islam and marriage is one of the institutions of the Apostles (on whom be the Peace!)[FN#177] nor were women created but for men."" Then Hasan commanded to put all the captives to the sword and the old woman cried out, saying, ""Slay them all and spare none[FN#178]!"" But, when Princess Manar al-Sana saw her sister in this plight, a bondswoman and in fetters, she wept over her and said, ""O my sister, who is this hath conquered us and made us captives in our own country?"" Quoth Nur al-Huda, ""Verily, this is a mighty matter. Indeed this man Hasan hath gotten the mastery over us and Allah hath given him dominion over us and over all our realm and he hath overcome us, us and the Kings of the Jinn."" And quoth her sister, ""Indeed, Allah aided him not against you nor did he overcome you nor capture you save by means of this cap and rod."" So Nur al-Huda was certified and assured that he had conquered her by means thereof and humbled herself to her sister, till she was moved to ruth for her and said to her husband, ""What wilt thou do with my sister? Behold, she is in thy hands and she hath done thee no misdeed that thou shouldest punish her."" Replied Hasan, ""Her torturing of thee was misdeed enow."" But she answered, saying, ""She hath excuse for all she did with me. As for thee, thou hast set my father's heart on fire for the loss of me, and what will be his case, if he lose my sister also?"" And he said to her, ""'Tis thine to decide; do whatso thou wilt."" So she bade loose her sister and the rest of the captives, and they did her bidding. Then she went up to Queen Nur al-Huda and embraced her, and they wept together a long while; after which quoth the Queen, ""O my sister, bear me not malice for that I did with thee;"" and quoth Manar al-Sana, ""O my sister, this was foreordained to me by Fate."" Then they sat on the couch talking and Manar al-Sana made peace between the old woman and her sister, after the goodliest fashion, and their hearts were set at ease. Thereupon Hasan dismissed the servants of the rod thanking them for the succour which they had afforded him against his foes, and Manar al-Sana related to her sister all that had befallen her with Hasan her husband and every thing he had suffered for her sake, saying, ""O my sister, since he hath done these deeds and is possessed of this might and Allah Almighty hath gifted him with such exceeding prowess, that he hath entered our country and beaten thine army and taken thee prisoner and defied our father, the Supreme King, who hath dominion over all the Princes of the Jinn, it behoveth us to fail not of what is due to him."" Replied Nur al-Huda, ""By Allah, O my sister, thou sayest sooth in whatso thou tellest me of the marvels which this man hath seen and suffered; and none may fail of respect to him. But was all this on thine account, O my sister?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,

She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Manar al-Sana repeated to her sister these praises of Hasan, the other replied, ""By Allah, this man can claim all respect more by token of his generosity. But was all this on thine account?"" ""Yes,"" answered Manar al-Sana, and they passed the night in converse till the morning morrowed and the sun rose and they were minded to depart. So they farewelled one another and Manar al-Sana gave God-speed to the ancient dame after the reconciling her with Queen Nur al-Huda. Thereupon Hasan smote the earth with the rod and its servants the Jinn appeared and saluted him, saying, ""Praised be Allah, who hath set thy soul at rest! Command us what thou wilt, and we will do it for thee in less than the twinking of an eye."" He thanked them for their saying and said to them ""Allah requite you with good! Saddle me two steeds of the best."" So they brought him forthwith two saddled coursers, one of which he mounted, taking his elder son before him, and his wife rode the other, taking the younger son in front of her. Then the Queen and the old woman also backed horse and departed, Hasan and his wife following the right and Nur al-Huda and Shawahi the left hand road. The spouses fared on with their children, without stopping, for a whole month, till they drew in sight of a city, which they found compassed about with trees and streams and, making the trees, dismounted beneath them thinking to rest there. As they sat talking, behold, they saw many horsemen coming towards them, whereupon Hasan rose and going to meet them, saw that it was King Hassun, lord of the Land of Camphor and Castle of Crystal, with his attendants. So Hasan went up to the King and kissed his hands and saluted him; and when Hassun saw him, he dismounted and seating himself with Hasan upon carpets under the trees returned his salam and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy, saying to him, ""O Hasan, tell me all that hath befallen thee, first and last."" So he told him all of that, whereupon the King marvelled and said to him, ""O my son, none ever reached the Islands of Wak and returned thence but thou, and indeed thy case is wondrous; but Alhamdolillah—praised be God—for safety!"" Then he mounted and bade Hasan ride with his wife and children into the city, where he lodged them in the guest-house of his palace; and they abode with him three days, eating and drinking in mirth and merriment, after which Hasan sought Hassun's leave to depart to his own country and the King granted it. Accordingly they took horse and the King rode with them ten days, after which he farewelled them and turned back, whilst Hasan and his wife and children fared on a whole month, at the end of which time they came to a great cavern, whose floor was of brass. Quoth Hasan to his wife, ""Kennest thou yonder cave?""; and quoth she, ""No."" Said he, ""Therein dwelleth a Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh hight, to whom I am greatly beholden, for that he was the means of my becoming acquainted with King Hassun."" Then he went on to tell her all that had passed between him and Abu al-Ruwaysh, and as he was thus engaged, behold, the Shaykh himself issued from the cavernmouth. When Hasan saw him, he dismounted from his steed and kissed his hands, and the old man saluted him and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him. Then he carried him into the antre and sat down with him, whilst Hasan related to him what had befallen him in the Islands of Wak; whereat the Elder marvelled with exceeding marvel and said, ""O Hasan, how didst thou deliver thy wife and children?"" So he told them the tale of the cap and the rod, hearing which he wondered and said, ""O Hasan, O my son, but for this rod and the cap, thou hadst never delivered thy wife and children."" And he replied, ""Even so, O my lord."" As they were talking, there came a knocking at the door and Abu al-Ruwaysh went out and found Abd al-Kaddus mounted on his elephant. So he saluted him and brought him into the cavern, where he embraced Hasan and congratulated him on his safety, rejoicing greatly in his return. Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, ""Tell the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus all that hath befallen thee, O Hasan."" He repeated to him every thing that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtieth Night,

She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan began relating to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus and Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh (who sat chattting in the cave) all that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap; where, upon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, ""O my son, thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further need of the two. Now we were the means of thy winning to the Islands of Wak, and I have done thee kindness for the sake of my nieces, the daughters of my brother; wherefore I beg thee, of thy bounty and favour, to give me the rod and the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh the cap."" When Hasan heard this, he hung down his head, being ashamed to reply, ""I will not give them to you,"" and said in his mind, ""Indeed these two Shaykhs have done me great kindness and were the means of my winning to the Islands of Wak, and but for them I had never made the place, nor delivered my children, nor had I gotten me this rod and cap."" So he raised his head and answered, ""Yes, I will give them to you: but, O my lords, I fear lest the Supreme King, my wife's father, come upon me with his commando and combat with me in my own country, and I be unable to repel them, for want of the rod and the cap."" Replied Abd al-Kaddus, ""Fear not, O my son; we will continually succour thee and keep watch and ward for thee in this place; and whosoever shall come against thee from thy wife's father or any other, him we will fend off from thee; wherefore be thou of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and feel naught whatsoever of fear, for no harm shall come to thee."" When Hasan heard this he was abashed and gave the cap to Abu al-Ruwaysh, saying to Abd al-Kaddus, ""Accompany me to my own country and I will give thee the rod."" At this the two elders rejoiced with exceeding joy and made him ready riches and treasures which beggar all description. He abode with them three days, at the end of which he set out again and the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus made ready to depart with him. So he and his wife mounted their beasts and Abd al-Kaddus whistled, when, behold, a mighty big elephant trotted up with fore hand and feet on amble from the heart of the desert and he took it and mounted it. Then they farewelled Abu al-Ruwaysh who disappeared within his cavern; and they fared on across country, traversing the land in its length and breadth wherever Abd al-Kaddus guided them by a short cut and an easy way, till they drew near the land of the Princesses; whereupon Hasan rejoiced at finding himself once more near his mother, and praised Allah for his safe return and reunion with his wife and children after so many hardships and perils; and thanked Him for His favours and bounties, reciting these couplets,

""Haply shall Allah deign us twain unite * And lockt in strict
       &nbsp    embrace we'll hail the light:
And wonders that befel me I'll recount, * And all I suffered from
       &nbsp    the Severance-blight:
And fain I'll cure mine eyes by viewing you * For ever yearned my
       &nbsp     heart to see your sight:
I hid a tale for you my heart within * Which when we meet o' morn
       &nbsp    I'll fain recite:
I'll blame you for the deeds by you were done * But while blame
       &nbsp    endeth love shall stay in site.""

Hardly had he made an end of these verses, when he looked and behold, there rose to view the Green Dome[FN#179] and the jetting Fount and the Emerald Palace, and the Mountain of Clouds showed to them from afar; whereupon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, ""Rejoice, O Hasan, in good tidings: to-night shalt thou be the guest of my nieces!"" At this he joyed with exceeding joy and as also did his wife, and they alighted at the domed pavilion, where they took their rest[FN#180] and ate and drank; after which they mounted horse again and rode on till they came upon the palace. As they drew near, the Princesses who were daughters of the King, brother to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, came forth to meet them and saluted them and their uncle who said to them, ""O daughters of my brother, behold, I have accomplished the need of this your brother Hasan and have helped him to regain his wife and children."" So they embraced him and gave him joy of his return in safety and health and of his reunion with his wife and children, and it was a day of festival[FN#181] with them. Then came forward Hasan's sister, the youngest Princess, and embraced him, weeping with sore weeping, whilst he also wept for his long desolation: after which she complained to him of that which she had suffered for the pangs of separation and weariness of spirit in his absence and recited these two couplets,

""After thy faring never chanced I'spy * A shape, but did thy form
       &nbsp     therein descry:
Nor closed mine eyes in sleep but thee I saw, * E'en as though
       &nbsp     dwelling 'twixt the lid and eye.""

When she had made an end of her verses, she rejoiced with joy exceeding and Hasan said to her, ""O my sister, I thank none in this matter save thyself over all thy sisters, and may Allah Almighty vouchsafe thee aidance and countenance!"" Then he related to her all that had past in his journey, from first to last, and all that he had undergone, telling her what had betided him with his wife's sister and how he had delivered his wife and wees and he also described to her all that he had seen of marvels and grievous perils, even to how Queen Nur al-Huda would have slain him and his spouse and children and none saved them from her but the Lord the Most High. Moreover, he related to her the adventure of the cap and the rod and how Abd al-Kaddus and Abu al-Ruwaysh had asked for them and he had not agreed to give them to the twain save for her sake; wherefore she thanked him and blessed him wishing him long life; and he cried, ""By Allah, I shall never forget all the kindness thou hast done me from incept to conclusion.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.

When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirty-first Night,

She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan foregathered with the Princesses, he related to his sister all that he had endured and said to her, ""Never will I forget what thou hast done for me from incept to conclusion."" Then she turned to his wife Manar al-Sana and embraced her and pressed her children to her breast, saying to her, ""O daughter of the Supreme King, was there no pity in thy bosom, that thou partedst him and his children and settedst his heart on fire for them? Say me, didst thou desire by this deed that he should die?"" The Princess laughed and answered, ""Thus was it ordained of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and whoso beguileth folk, him shall Allah begule.""[FN#182] Then they set on somewhat of meat and drink, and they all ate and drank and made merry. They abode thus ten days in feast and festival, mirth and merry-making, at the end of which time Hasan prepared to continue his journey. So his sister rose and made him ready riches and rarities, such as defy description. Then she strained him to her bosom, because of leavetaking, and threw her arms round his neck whilst he recited on her account these couplets,

""The solace of lovers is naught but far, * And parting is naught
       &nbsp   save grief singular:
And ill-will and absence are naught but woe, * And the victims of
       &nbsp  Love naught but martyrs are;
And how tedious is night to the loving wight * From his true love
       &nbsp   parted 'neath evening star!
His tears course over his cheeks and so * He cries, 'O tears be
       &nbsp     there more to flow?'""

With this Hasan gave the rod to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who joyed therein with exceeding joy and thanking him and securing it mounted and returned to his own place. Then Hasan took horse with his wife and children and departed from the Palace of the Princesses, who went forth[FN#183] with him, to farewell him. Then they turned back and Hasan fared on, over wild and wold, two months and ten days, till he came to the city of Baghdad, the House of Peace, and repairing to his home by the private postern which gave upon the open country, knocked at the door. Now his mother, for long absence, had forsworn sleep and given herself to mourning and weeping and wailing, till she fell sick and ate no meat, neither took delight in slumber but shed tears night and day. She ceased not to call upon her son's name albeit she despaired of his returning to her; and as he stood at the door, he heard her weeping and reciting these couplets,

""By Allah, heal, O my lords, the unwhole * Of wasted frame and
       &nbsp     heart worn with dole:
An you grant her a meeting 'tis but your grace * Shall whelm in
       &nbsp    the boons of the friend her soul:
I despair not of Union the Lord can grant * And to weal of
       &nbsp    meeting our woes control!""

When she had ended her verses, she heard her son's voice at the door, calling out, ""O mother, mother ah! fortune hath been kind and hath vouchsafed our reunion!"" Hearing his cry she knew his voice and went to the door, between belief and misbelief; but, when she opened it she saw him standing there and with him his wife and children; so she shrieked aloud, for excess of joy, and fell to the earth in a fainting-fit. Hasan ceased not soothing her, till she recovered and embraced him; then she wept with joy, and presently she called his slaves and servants and bade them carry all his baggage into the house.[FN#184] So they brought in every one of the loads, and his wife and children entered also, whereupon Hasan's mother went up to the Princess and kissed her head and bussed her feet, saying, ""O daughter of the Supreme King, if I have failed of thy due, behold, I crave pardon of Almighty Allah."" Then she turned to Hasan and said to him, ""O my son, what was the cause of this long strangerhood?"" He related to her all his adventures from beginning to end; and when she heard tell of all that had befallen him, she cried a great cry and fell down a-fainting at the very mention of his mishaps. He solaced her, till she came to herself and said, ""By Allah, O my son, thou hast done unwisely in parting with the rod and the cap for, hadst thou kept them with the care due to them, thou wert master of the whole earth, in its breadth and length; but praised be Allah, for thy safety, O my son, and that of thy wife and children!"" They passed the night in all pleasance and happiness, and on the morrow Hasan changed his clothes and donning a suit of the richest apparel, went down into the bazar and bought black slaves and slave-girls and the richest stuffs and ornaments and furniture such as carpets and costly vessels and all manner other precious things, whose like is not found with Kings. Moreover, he purchased houses and gardens and estates and so forth and abode with his wife and his children and his mother, eating and drinking and pleasuring: nor did they cease from all joy of life and its solace till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies. And Glory be to Him who hath dominion over the Seen and the Unseen,[FN#185] who is the Living, the Eternal, Who dieth not at all! And men also recount the adventures of


Footnotes:


[FN#5] This famous tale is a sister prose-poem to the ""Arabian
Odyssey"" Sindbad the Seaman; only the Bassorite's travels are in
Jinn-land and Japan. It has points of resemblance in
""fundamental outline"" with the Persian Romance of the Fairy Hasan
Bánú and King Bahrám-i-Gúr. See also the Kathá (s.s.) and the two
sons of the Asúra Máyá; the Tartar ""Sidhi Kúr"" (Tales of a
Vampire or Enchanted Corpse) translated by Mr. W. J. Thoms (the
Father of ""Folk-lore"" in 1846,) in ""Lays and Legends of various
Nations""; the Persian Bahár-i-Dánish (Prime of Lore). Miss
Stokes' ""Indian Fairy Tales""; Miss Frere's ""Old Deccan Days"" and
Mrs. F. A. Steel's ""Tale of the King and his Seven Sons,"" with
notes by Lieutenant (now Captain) R. C. Temple (Folk-lore of the
Panjab, Indian Antiquary of March, 1882).

[FN#6] In the Mac. Edit. (vol. iv. i.) the merchant has two sons who became one a brazier (""dealer in copper-wares"" says Lane iii. 385) and the other a goldsmith. The Bresl. Edit. (v. 264) mentions only one son, Hasan, the hero of the story which is entitled, ""Tale of Hasan al-Basrí and the Isles of Wák Wák.""

[FN#7] Arab. ""Shásh Abyaz:"" this distinctive sign of the True Believer was adopted by the Persian to conceal his being a fire-worshipper, Magian or ""Guebre."" The latter word was introduced from the French by Lord Byron and it is certainly far superior to Moore's ""Gheber.""

[FN#8] Persians being always a suspected folk.

[FN#9] Arab. ""Al-Búdikah"" afterwards used (Night dcclxxix) in the sense of crucible or melting-pot, in modern parlance a pipe-bowl; and also written ""Bútakah,"" an Arab distortion of the Persian ""Bútah.""

[FN#10] Arab. ""Sindán"" or ""Sindiyán"" (Dozy). ""Sandán,"" anvil;
""Sindán,"" big, strong (Steingass).

[FN#11] Arab. ""Kímíya,"" (see vol. i. 305) properly the substance which transmutes metals, the ""philosopher's stone"" which, by the by, is not a stone; and comes from , a fluid, a wet drug, as opposed to Iksír (Al-) a dry drug. Those who care to see how it is still studied will consult my History of Sindh (chapt. vii) and my experience which pointed only to the use made of it in base coinage. Hence in mod. tongue Kímiyáwi, an alchemist, means a coiner, a smasher. The reader must not suppose that the transmutation of metals is a dead study: I calculate that there are about one hundred workers in London alone.

[FN#12] Arab. ""Al-Kír,"" a bellows also = Kúr, a furnace. For the full meaning of this sentence, see my ""Book of the Sword,"" p. 119.

[FN#13] Lit. ""bade him lean upon it with the shears"" (Al-Káz).

[FN#14] There are many kinds of Kohls (Hindos. Surmá and
Kajjal) used in medicine and magic. See Herklots, p. 227.

[FN#15] Arab. ""Sabíkah"" = bar, lamina, from ""Sabk"" = melting, smelting: the lump in the crucible would be hammered out into an ingot in order to conceal the operation

[FN#16] i.e. £375.

[FN#17] Such report has cost many a life: the suspicion was and is still deadly as heresy in a ""new Christian"" under the Inquisition.

[FN#18] Here there is a double entendre: openly it means, ""Few men recognise as they should the bond of bread and salt:"" the other sense would be (and that accounts for the smile), ""What the deuce do I care for the bond?""

[FN#19] Arab. ""Kabbát"" in the Bresl. Edit. ""Ka'abán "": Lane (iii. 519) reads ""Ka'áb plur. of Ka'ab a cup.""

[FN#20] A most palpable sneer. But Hasan is purposely represented as a ""softy"" till aroused and energized by the magic of Love.

[FN#21] Arab. ""Al-iksír"" (see Night dcclxxix, supra p. 9): the Greek word which has returned from a trip to Arabia and reappeared in Europe as ""Elixir.""

[FN#22] ""Awák"" plur. of ""Ukíyah,"" the well-known ""oke,"" or ""ocque,"" a weight varying from 1 to 2 lbs. In Morocco it is pronounced ""Wukíyah,"" and = the Spanish ounce (p. 279 Rudimentos del Arabe Vulgar, etc., by Fr. José de Lorchundi, Madrid, Rivadencyra, 1872).

[FN#23] These lines have occurred in vol. iv. 267, where references to other places are given. I quote Lane by way of variety. In the text they are supposed to have been written by the Persian, a hint that Hasan would never be seen again.

[FN#24] i.e. a superfetation of iniquity.

[FN#25] Arab. ""Kurbán"" = offering, oblation to be brought to the priest's house or to the altar of the tribal God Yahveh, Jehovah (Levit. ii, 2-3 etc.). Amongst the Maronites Kurban is the host (-wafer) and amongst the Turks 'Id al-Kurban (sacrifice-feast) is the Greater Bayram, the time of Pilgrimage.

[FN#26] Nár = fire, being feminine, like the names of the other ""elements.""

[FN#27] The Egyptian Kurbáj of hippopotamus-hide (Burkh. Nubia, pp. 62,282) or elephant-hide (Turner ii. 365). Hence the Fr. Cravache (as Cravat is from Croat).

[FN#28] In Mac. Edit. ""Bahriyah"": in Bresl. Edit. ""Nawátíyah.""
See vol. vi. 242, for , navita, nauta.

[FN#29] In Bresl. Edit. (iv. 285) ""Yá Khwájah,"" for which see vol. vi. 46.

[FN#30] Arab. ""Tabl"" (vulg. baz) = a kettle-drum about half a foot broad held in the left hand and beaten with a stick or leathern thong. Lane refers to his description (M.E. ii. chapt. v.) of the Dervish's drum of tinned copper with parchment face, and renders Zakhmah or Zukhmah (strap, stirrup-leather) by ""plectrum,"" which gives a wrong idea. The Bresl. Edit. ignores the strap.

[FN#31] The ""Spartivento"" of Italy, mostly a tall headland which divides the clouds. The most remarkable feature of the kind is the Dalmatian Island, Pelagosa.

[FN#32] The ""Rocs"" (Al-Arkhákh) in the Bresl. Edit. (iv. 290).
The Rakham = aquiline vulture.

[FN#33] Lane here quotes a similar incident in the romance ""Sayf Zú al-Yazan,"" so called from the hero, whose son, Misr, is sewn up in a camel's hide by Bahrám, a treacherous Magian, and is carried by the Rukhs to a mountain-top.

[FN#34] These lines occurred in Night xxvi. vol. i. 275: I quote
Mr. Payne for variety.

[FN#35] Thus a Moslem can not only circumcise and marry himself but can also bury canonically himself. The form of this prayer is given by Lane M. E. chapt. xv.

[FN#36] i.e. If I fail in my self-imposed duty, thou shalt charge me therewith on the Judgment-day.

[FN#37] Arab. ""Al-Alwán,"" plur. of laun (colour). The latter in Egyptian Arabic means a ""dish of meat."" See Burckhardt No. 279. I repeat that the great traveller's ""Arabic Proverbs"" wants republishing for two reasons. First he had not sufficient command of English to translate with the necessary laconism and assonance: secondly in his day British Philistinism was too rampant to permit a literal translation. Consequently the book falls short of what the Oriental student requires; and I have prepared it for my friend Mr. Quaritch.

[FN#38] i.e. Lofty, high-builded. See Night dcclxviii. vol. vii. p. 347. In the Bresl. Edit. Al-Masíd (as in Al-Kazwíni): in the Mac. Edit. Al-Mashid

[FN#39] Arab. ""Munkati"" here = cut off from the rest of the world. Applied to a man, and a popular term of abuse in Al-Hijáz, it means one cut off from the blessings of Allah and the benefits of mankind; a pauvre sire. (Pilgrimage ii. 22.)

[FN#40] Arab. ""Baras au Juzám,"" the two common forms of leprosy. See vol. iv. 51. Popular superstition in Syria holds that coition during the menses breeds the Juzám, Dáa al-Kabír (Great Evil) or Dáa al-Fíl (Elephantine Evil), i.e. Elephantiasis and that the days between the beginning of the flow (Sabíl) to that of coition shows the age when the progeny will be attacked; for instance if it take place on the first day, the disease will appear in the tenth year, on the fourth the fortieth and so on. The only diseases really dreaded by the Badawin are leprosy and small-pox. Coition during the menses is forbidden by all Eastern faiths under the severest penalties. Al-Mas'údi relates how a man thus begotten became a determined enemy of Ali; and the ancient Jews attributed the magical powers of Joshua Nazarenus to this accident of his birth, the popular idea being that sorcerers are thus impurely engendered.

[FN#41] By adoption - See vol. iii. 151. This sudden affection (not love) suggests the ""Come to my arms, my slight acquaintance!"" of the Anti-Jacobin. But it is true to Eastern nature; and nothing can be more charming than this fast friendship between the Princess and Hasan.

[FN#42] En tout bien et en tout honneur, be it understood.

[FN#43] He had done nothing of the kind; but the feminine mind is prone to exaggeration. Also Hasan had told them a fib, to prejudice them against the Persian.

[FN#44] These nervous movements have been reduced to a system in the Turk. ""Ihtilájnámeh"" = Book of palpitations, prognosticating from the subsultus tendinum and other involuntary movements of the body from head to foot; according to Ja'afar the Just, Daniel the Prophet, Alexander the Great; the Sages of Persia and the Wise Men of Greece. In England we attend chiefly to the eye and ear.

[FN#45] Revenge, amongst the Arabs, is a sacred duty; and, in their state of civilization, society could not be kept together without it. So the slaughter of a villain is held to be a sacrifice to Allah, who amongst Christians claims for Himself the monopoly of vengeance.

[FN#46] Arab. ""Zindík."" See vol. v. 230.

[FN#47] Lane translates this ""put for him the remaining food and water;"" but Ai-Akhar (Mac. Edit.) evidently refers to the Najíb (dromedary).

[FN#48] We can hardly see the heroism of the deed, but it must be remembered that Bahram was a wicked sorcerer, whom it was every good Moslem's bounden duty to slay. Compare the treatment of witches in England two centuries ago.

[FN#49] The mother in Arab tales is ma mère, now becoming somewhat ridiculous in France on account of the over use of that venerable personage.

[FN#50] The forbidden closet occurs also in Sayf Zú al-Yazan, who enters it and finds the bird-girls. Trébutien ii, 208 says, ""Il est assez remarquable qu'il existe en Allemagne une tradition à peu près semblable, et qui a fourni le sujet d'un des contes de Musaeus, entitulé, le voile enlevé."" Here Hasan is artfully left alone in a large palace without other companions but his thoughts and the reader is left to divine the train of ideas which drove him to open the door.

[FN#51] Arab. ""Buhayrah"" (Bresl. Edit. ""Bahrah""), the tank or cistern in the Hosh (court-yard) of an Eastern house. Here, however, it is a rain-cistern on the flat roof of the palace (See Night dcccviii).

[FN#52] This description of the view is one of the most gorgeous in The Nights.

[FN#53] Here again are the ""Swan-maidens"" (See vol. v. 346) ""one of the primitive myths, the common heritage of the whole Aryan (Iranian) race."" In Persia Bahram-i-Gúr when carried off by the Dív Sapíd seizes the Peri's dove-coat: in Santháli folk-lore Torica, the Goatherd, steals the garment doffed by one of the daughters of the sun; and hence the twelve birds of Russian Story. To the same cycle belong the Seal-tales of the Faroe Islands (Thorpe's Northern Mythology) and the wise women or mermaids of Shetland (Hibbert). Wayland the smith captures a wife by seizing a mermaid's raiment and so did Sir Hagán by annexing the wardrobe of a Danubian water-nymph. Lettsom, the translator, mixes up this swan-raiment with that of the Valkyries or Choosers of the Slain. In real life stealing women's clothes is an old trick and has often induced them, after having been seen naked, to offer their persons spontaneously. Of this I knew two cases in India, where the theft is justified by divine example. The blue god Krishna, a barbarous and grotesque Hindu Apollo, robbed the raiment of the pretty Gopálís (cowherdesses) who were bathing in the Arjun River and carried them to the top of a Kunduna tree; nor would he restore them till he had reviewed the naked girls and taken one of them to wife. See also Imr al-Kays (of the Mu'allakah) with ""Onaiza"" at the port of Daratjuljul (Clouston's Arabian Poetry, p.4). A critic has complained of my tracing the origin of the Swan-maiden legend to the physical resemblance between the bird and a high-bred girl (vol. v. 346). I should have explained my theory which is shortly, that we must seek a material basis for all so-called supernaturalisms, and that anthropomorphism satisfactorily explains the Swan-maiden, as it does the angel and the devil. There is much to say on the subject; but this is not the place for long discussion.

[FN#54] Arab. ""Nafs Ammárah,"" corresponding with our canting term ""The Flesh."" Nafs al-Nátíkah is the intellectual soul or function; Nafs al-Ghazabíyah = the animal function and Nafs al Shahwáníyah = the vegetative property.

[FN#55] The lines occur in vol. ii. 331: I have quoted Mr.
Payne. Here they are singularly out of place.
[FN#56] Not the ""green gown"" of Anglo-India i.e. a white ball-dress with blades of grass sticking to it in consequence of a ""fall backwards.""

[FN#57] These lines occur in vol. i. 219: I have borrowed from
Torrens (p. 219).
[FN#58] The appearance of which ends the fast and begins the
Lesser Festival. See vol. i. 84.
[FN#59] See note, vol. i. 84, for notices of the large navel; much appreciated by Easterns.

[FN#60] Arab. ""Shá'ir Al-Walahán"" = the love-distraught poet; Lane has ""a distracted poet."" My learned friend Professor Aloys Sprenger has consulted, upon the subject of Al-Walahán the well-known Professor of Arabic at Halle, Dr. Thorbeck, who remarks that the word (here as further on) must be an adjective, mad, love-distraught, not a ""lakab"" or poetical cognomen. He generally finds it written Al-Shá'ir al-Walahán (the love-demented poet) not Al-Walahán al-Shá'ir = Walahán the Poet. Note this burst of song after the sweet youth falls in love: it explains the cause of verse-quotation in The Nights, poetry being the natural language of love and battle.

[FN#61] ""Them"" as usual for ""her.""

[FN#62] Here Lane proposes a transposition, for ""Wa-huwá (and he) fi'l-hubbi,"" to read ""Fi 'l-hubbi wa huwa (wa-hwa);"" but the latter is given in the Mac. Edit.

[FN#63] For the pun in ""Sabr""=aloe or patience. See vol. i. 138. In Herr Landberg (i. 93) we find a misunderstanding of the couplet—

""Aw'ákibu s-sabri (Kála ba'azuhum)
Mahmúdah: Kultu, 'khshi an takhirriní.'""

""The effects of patience"" (or aloes) quoth one ""are praiseworthy!"" Quoth I, ""Much I fear lest it make me stool."" Mahmúdah is not only un laxatif, but a slang name for a confection of aloes.

[FN#64] Arab. ""Akúna fidá-ka."" Fidá = ransom, self-sacrifice and
Fidá'an = instead of. The phrase, which everywhere occurs in The
Nights, means, ""I would give my life to save thine ""

[FN#65] Thus accounting for his sickness, improbably enough but in flattering way. Like a good friend (feminine) she does not hesitate a moment in prescribing a fib.

[FN#66] i.e. the 25,000 Amazons who in the Bresl. Edit. (ii. 308) are all made to be the King's Banát"" = daughters or protégées. The Amazons of Dahome (see my ""Mission"") who may now number 5,000 are all officially wives of the King and are called by the lieges ""our mothers.""

[FN#67] The tale-teller has made up his mind about the damsel; although in this part of the story she is the chief and eldest sister and subsequently she appears as the youngest daughter of the supreme Jinn King. The mystification is artfully explained by the extraordinary likeness of the two sisters. (See Night dcccxi.)

[FN#68] This is a reminiscence of the old-fashioned ""marriage by capture,"" of which many traces survive, even among the civilised who wholly ignore their origin.

[FN#69] Meaning her companions and suite.

[FN#70] Arab. ""'Abáah"" vulg. ""'Abáyah."" See vol. ii. 133.

[FN#71] Feet in the East lack that development of sebaceous glands which afflicts Europeans.

[FN#72] i.e. cutting the animals' throats after Moslem law.

[FN#73] In Night dcclxxviii. supra p.5, we find the orthodox Moslem doctrine that ""a single mortal is better in Allah's sight than a thousand Jinns."" For, I repeat, Al-Islam systematically exalts human nature which Christianity takes infinite trouble to degrade and debase. The results of its ignoble teaching are only too evident in the East: the Christians of the so-called (and miscalled) ""Holy Land"" are a disgrace to the faith and the idiomatic Persian term for a Nazarene is ""Tarsá"" = funker, coward.

[FN#74] Arab. ""Sakaba Kúrahá;"" the forge in which children are hammered out?

[FN#75] Arab. ""Má al-Maláhat"" = water (brilliancy) of beauty.

[FN#76] The fourth of the Seven Heavens, the ""Garden of
Eternity,"" made of yellow coral.
[FN#77] How strange this must sound to the Young Woman of London in the nineteenth century.

[FN#78] ""Forty days"" is a quasi-religious period amongst Moslem for praying, fasting and religious exercises: here it represents our ""honey-moon."" See vol. v. p. 62.

[FN#79] Yá layta, still popular. Herr Carlo Landberg (Proverbes et Dictons du Peuple Arabe, vol. i. of Syria, Leyden, E. J. Brill, 1883) explains layta for rayta (=raayta) by permutation of liquids and argues that the contraction is ancient (p. 42). But the Herr is no Arabist: ""Layta"" means ""would to Heaven,"" or, simply ""I wish,"" ""I pray"" (for something possible or impossible); whilst ""La'alla"" (perhaps, it may be) prays only for the possible: and both are simply particles governing the noun in the oblique or accusative case.

[FN#80] ""His"" for ""her,"" i.e. herself, making somewhat of confusion between her state and that of her son.

[FN#81] i.e. his mother; the words are not in the Mac. Edit.

[FN#82] Baghdad is called House of Peace, amongst other reasons, from the Dijlah (Tigris) River and Valley ""of Peace."" The word was variously written Baghdád, Bághdád, (our old Bughdaud and Bagdat), Baghzáz, Baghzán, Baghdán, Baghzám and Maghdád as Makkah and Bakkah (Koran iii. 90). Religious Moslems held Bágh (idol) and Dád (gift) an ill-omened conjunction, and the Greeks changed it to Eirenopolis. (See Ouseley's Oriental Collcctions, vol. i. pp. 18-20.)

[FN#83] This is a popular saying but hardly a ""vulgar proverb.""
(Lane iii. 522.) It reminds rather of Shakespear's:
""So loving to my mother,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly.""

[FN#84] i.e. God forbid that I should oppose thee!

[FN#85] Here the writer again forgets apparently, that Shahrazad is speaking: she may, however, use the plural for the singular when speaking of herself.

[FN#86] i.e. She would have pleaded ill-treatment and lawfully demanded to be sold.

[FN#87] The Hindus speak of ""the only bond that woman knows—her heart.""

[FN#88] i.e. a rarity, a present (especially in Persian).

[FN#89] Arab. ""Al-bisát"" wa'l-masnad lit. the carpet and the cushion.

[FN#90] For ""Báb al-bahr"" and ""Báb al-Barr"" see vol. iii. 281.

[FN#91] She was the daughter of Ja'afar bin Mansúr; but, as will be seen, The Nights again and again called her father Al-Kásim.

[FN#92] This is an error for the fifth which occurs in the popular saying, ""Is he the fifth of the sons of Al-Abbás!"" i.e. Harun al-Rashid. Lane (note, in loco) thus accounts for the frequent mention of the Caliph, the greatest of the Abbasides in The Nights. But this is a causa non causa.

[FN#93] i.e. I find thy beauty all-sufficient. So the proverb ""The son of the quarter (young neighbour) filleth not the eye,"" which prefers a stranger.

[FN#94] They are mere doggerel, like most of the pieces de circonstance.

[FN#95] Afterwards called Wák Wák, and in the Bresl. Edit. Wák al-Wák. See Lane's notes upon these Islands. Arab Geographers evidently speak of two Wak Waks. Ibn al-Fakih and Al-Mas'údi (Fr. Transl., vol. iii. 6-7) locate one of them in East Africa beyond Zanzibar and Sofala. ""Le territoire des Zendjes (Zanzibar-Negroids) commence au canal (Al-Khalij) dérivé du haut Nil (the Juln River?) et se prolonge jusqu'au pays de Sofalah et des Wak-Wak."" It is simply the peninsula of Guardafui (Jard Hafun) occupied by the Gallas, pagans and Christians, before these were ousted by the Moslem Somal; and the former perpetually ejaculated ""Wak"" (God) as Moslems cry upon Allah. This identification explains a host of other myths such as the Amazons, who as Marco Polo tells us held the ""Female Island"" Socotra (Yule ii. 396). The fruit which resembled a woman's head (whence the puelloe Wakwakienses hanging by the hair from trees), and which when ripe called out ""Wak Wak"" and ""Allah al-Khallák"" (the Creator) refers to the Calabash-tree (Adausonia digitata), that grotesque growth, a vegetable elephant, whose gourds, something larger than a man's head, hang by a slender filament. Similarly the ""cocoa"" got its name, in Port. = Goblin, from the fancied face at one end. The other Wak Wak has been identified in turns with the Seychelles, Madagascar, Malacca, Sunda or Java (this by Langlès), China and Japan. The learned Prof. de Goeje (Arabishe Berichten over Japan, Amsterdam, Muller, 1880) informs us that in Canton the name of Japan is Wo-Kwok, possibly a corruption of Koku-tan, the ebony-tree (Diospyros ebenum) which Ibn Khor-dábah and others find together with gold in an island 4,500 parasangs from Suez and East of China. And we must remember that Basrah was the chief starting-place for the Celestial Empire during the rule of the Tang dynasty (seventh and ninth centuries). Colonel J. W. Watson of Bombay suggests New Guinea or the adjacent islands where the Bird of Paradise is said to cry ""Wak Wak!"" Mr. W. F. Kirby in the Preface (p. ix.) to his neat little book ""The New Arabian Nights,"" says: ""The Islands of Wak-Wak, seven years' journey from Bagdad, in the story of Hasan, have receded to a distance of a hundred and fifty years' journey in that of Majin (of Khorasan). There is no doubt(?) that the Cora Islands, near New Guinea, are intended; for the wonderful fruits which grow there are Birds of Paradise, which settle in flocks on the trees at sunset and sunrise, uttering this very cry."" Thus, like Ophir, Wak Wak has wandered all over the world and has been found even in Peru by the Turkish work Tárikh al-Hind al-Gharbi = History of the West Indies (Orient. Coll. iii 189).

[FN#96] I accept the emendation of Lane's Shaykh, ""Nasím ""
(Zephyr) for ""Nadím "" (cup-companion).

[FN#97] ""Jannat al-Ná'im"" = Garden of Delights is No. V Heaven, made of white diamond.

[FN#98] This appears to her very prettily put.

[FN#99] This is the ""House of Sadness"" of our old chivalrous Romances. See chapt. vi. of ""Palmerin of England,"" by Francisco de Moraes (ob. 1572), translated by old Anthony Munday (dateless, 1590?) and ""corrected"" (read spoiled) by Robert Southey, London, Longmans, 1807.

[FN#100] The lines have occurred in Night clix. (vol. iii. 183), I quote Mr. Payne who, like Lane, prefers ""in my bosom"" to ""beneath my ribs.""

[FN#101] In this tale the Bresl. Edit. more than once adds ""And let us and you send a blessing to the Lord of Lords"" (or to ""Mohammed,"" or to the ""Prophet""); and in vol. v. p. 52 has a long prayer. This is an act of contrition in the tale-teller for romancing against the expressed warning of the Founder of Al-Islam.

[FN#102] From Bresl. Edit. (vi. 29): the four in the Mac. Edit. are too irrelevant.

[FN#103] Arab. ""Ghayúr""—jealous, an admirable epithet which
Lane dilutes to ""changeable""—making a truism of a metaphor.

[FN#104] These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.

[FN#105] i.e. One fated to live ten years.

[FN#106] This poetical way of saying ""fourteen"" suggests Camoens
(The Lusiads) Canto v. 2.
[FN#107] Arab. ""Surrah,"" lit. = a purse: a few lines lower down it is called ""'Ulbah"" = a box which, of course, may have contained the bag.

[FN#108] The month which begins the Moslem year.

[FN#109] As an Arab often does when deep in thought. Lane appositely quotes John viii. 6. ""Jonas stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground."" Mr. Payne translates, ""He fell a-drumming on the earth with his fingers,"" but this does not complete the sense.

[FN#110] i.e.""And the peace of Allah be upon thee! that will end thy story."" The Arab formula, ""Wa al-Salám"" (pron. Wassalám) is used in a variety of senses.

[FN#111] Like Camoens, one of the model lovers, he calls upon
Love to torment him still more—ad majorern Dei (amoris) gloriam.
[FN#112] Pron. Aboor-Ruwaysh. ""The Father of the little Feather"": he is afterwards called ""Son of the daughter of the accursed Iblis""; yet, as Lane says, ""he appears to be a virtuous person.""

[FN#113] Arab. ""Kantara al-lijám fi Karbús (bow) sarjih.""

[FN#114] I do not translate ""beckoned"" because the word would give a wrong idea. Our beckoning with the finger moved towards the beckoner makes the so-beckoned Eastern depart in all haste. To call him you must wave the hand from you.

[FN#115] The Arabs knew what large libraries were; and a learned man could not travel without camel-loads of dictionaries.

[FN#116] Arab. ""Adim;"" now called Bulghár, our Moroccan leather.

[FN#117] Arab. ""Zinád,"" which Lane renders by ""instruments for striking fire,"" and Mr. Payne, after the fashion of the translators of Al-Hariri, ""flint and steel.""

[FN#118] A congener of Hasan and Husayn, little used except in Syria where it is a favourite name for Christians. The Muhít of Butrus Al-Bostáni (s.v.) tells us that it also means a bird called Abú Hasan and supplies various Egyptian synonyms. In Mod. Arab. Grammar the form Fa''úl is a diminutive as Hammúd for Ahmad, 'Ammúr for 'Amrú. So the fem. form, Fa''úlah, e.g. Khaddúgah = little Khadijah and Naffúsah=little Nafisah; Ar'úrah = little clitoris - whereas in Heb. it is an incrementative e.g. dabbúlah a large dablah (cake or lump of dried figs, etc.).

[FN#119] In the Mac. Edit. ""Soldiers of Al-Daylam"" i.e. warlike as the Daylamites or Medes. See vol. ii. 94.

[FN#120] Bilkís, it will be remembered, is the Arab. name of the
Queen of Sheba who visited Solomon. In Abyssinia she is termed
Kebra zá negest or zá makadá, the latter (according to Ferdinand
Werne's ""African Wanderings,"" Longmans, 1852) being synonymous
with Ityopia or Habash (Ethiopia or Abyssinia).

[FN#121] Arab. ""Dakkah,"" which Lane translates by ""settee.""

[FN#122] Arab. ""Ambar al-Khám"" the latter word (raw) being pure
Persian.

[FN#123] The author neglects to mention the ugliest part of old-womanhood in the East, long empty breasts like tobacco-pouches. In youth the bosom is beautifully high, arched and rounded, firm as stone to the touch, with the nipples erect and pointing outwards. But after the girl-mother's first child (in Europe le premier embellit) all changes. Nature and bodily power have been overtasked; then comes the long suckling at the mother's expense: the extension of the skin and the enlargement of its vessels are too sudden and rapid for the diminished ability of contraction and the bad food aids in the continual consumption of vitality. Hence, among Eastern women age and ugliness are synonymous. It is only in the highest civilisation that we find the handsome old woman.

[FN#124] The name has occurred in the Knightly tale of King Omar and his sons, Vol. ii. 269. She is here called Mother of Calamities,but in p. 123, Vol. iv. of the Mac. Edit. she becomes ""Lady (Zát) al-Dawáhi."" It will be remembered that the title means calamitous to the foe.

[FN#125] By this address she assured him that she had no design upon his chastity. In Moslem lands it is always advisable to accost a strange woman, no matter how young, with, ""Yá Ummí!"" = O my mother. This is pledging one's word, as it were, not to make love to her.

[FN#126] Apparently the Wakites numbered their Islands as the Anglo-Americans do their streets. For this they have been charged with ""want of imagination""; but the custom is strictly classical. See at Pompeii ""Reg (io) I; Ins (ula) 1, Via Prima, Secunda,"" etc.

[FN#127] These are the Puellæ Wakwakienses of whom Ibn Al-Wardi relates after an ocular witness, ""Here too is a tree which bears fruits like women who have fair faces and are hung by their hair. They come forth from integuments like large leathern bags (calabash-gourds?) and when they sense air and sun they cry 'Wak! Wak!' (God! God!) till their hair is cut, and when it is cut they die; and the islanders understand this cry wherefrom they augure ill."" The Ajáib al-Hind (chapt. xv.) places in Wak-land the Samandal, a bird which enters the fire without being burnt evidently the Egyptian ""Pi-Benni,"" which the Greeks metamorphised to ""Phoenix."" It also mentions a hare-like animal, now male then female, and the Somal behind Cape Guardafui tell the same tale of their Cynhyænas.

[FN#128] i.e. I will keep thee as though thou wert the apple of my eye.

[FN#129] A mere exaggeration of the ""Gull-fairs"" noted by travellers in sundry islands as Ascension and the rock off Brazilian Santos.

[FN#130] Arab. ""Kámil wa Basít wa Wáfir"" = the names of three popular metres, for which see the Terminal Essay.

[FN#131] Arab. ""Manáshif"" = drying towels, Plur. of Minshafah, and the popular term which Dr. Jonathan Swift corrupted to ""Munnassaf."" Lane (Nights, Introduct. p. ix.).

[FN#132] Arab. ""Shafaif"" opposed to ""Shafah"" the mouth-lips.

[FN#133] Fountains of Paradise. This description is a fair instance of how the Saj'a (prose-rhyme) dislocates the order; an Arab begins with hair, forehead, eyebrows and lashes and when he reaches the nose, he slips down to the toes for the sake of the assonance. If the latter be neglected the whole list of charms must be otherwise ordered; and the student will compare Mr. Payne's version of this passage with mine.

[FN#134] A fair specimen of the Arab logogriph derived from the Abjad Alphabet which contains only the Hebrew and Syriac letters not the six Arabic. Thus 4 X 5=20 which represents the Kaf (K) and 6 X 10=60, or Sin (S). The whole word is thus ""Kos"", the Greek or , and the lowest word, in Persian as in Arabic, for the female pudenda, extensively used in vulgar abuse. In my youth we had at the University something of the kind,

To five and five and fifty-five
The first of letters add
To make a thing to please a King
And drive a wise man mad.

Answer VVLVA. Very interesting to the anthropological student is this excursus of Hasan, who after all manner of hardships and horrors and risking his life to recover his wife and children, breaks out into song on the subject of her privities. And it can hardly be tale-teller's gag as both verse and prose show considerable art in composition. (See p. 348.)

Supplementary Note To Hasan of Bassorah.

Note(p.93)—There is something wondrous naïve in a lover who, when asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour, breaks out into versical praises of her parts. But even the classical Arab authors did not disdain such themes. See in Al-Harírí (Ass. of Mayyáfarikín) where Abú Zayd laments the impotency of old age in form of a Rasy or funeral oration (Preston p. 484, and Chenery p. 221). It completely deceived Sir William Jones, who inserted it into the chapter ""De Poesi Funebri,"" p. 527 (Poeseos Asiaticæ Commentarii), gravely noting, ""Hæc Elegia non admodum dissimilis esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de Sauli et Jonathani obitu; at que adeò versus iste ubi provocant adversarios nunquam rediit a pugnæ contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto, ex Hebræoreddi videtur,

A sanguine occisorum, a fortium virorum adipe,
Arcus Jonathani non rediit irritus.""
I need hardly say with Captain Lockett (226) that this ""Sabb warrior,"" this Arabian Achilles, is the celebrated Bonus Deus or Hellespontiacus of the Ancients. The oration runs thus:—

O folk I have a wondrous tale, so rare
Much shall it profit hearers wise and ware!
I saw in salad-years a potent Brave
And sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive;
Who entered joust and list with hardiment
Fearless of risk, of victory confident,
His vigorous onset straitest places oped
And easy passage through all narrows groped:
He ne'er encountered foe in single fight
But came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright;
Nor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark—
With fencèd gates defended deep and dark—
When shown his flag without th' auspicious cry
""Aidance from Allah and fair victory nigh!""
Thus wise full many a night his part he played
In strength and youthtide's stately garb arrayed,
Dealing to fair young girl delicious joy
And no less welcome to the blooming boy.
But Time ne'er ceased to stint his wondrous strength
(Steadfast and upright as the gallow's length)
Until the Nights o'erthrew him by their might
And friends contemned him for a feckless wight;
Nor was a wizard but who wasted skill
Over his case, nor leach could heal his ill.
Then he abandoned arms abandoned him
Who gave and took salutes so fierce and grim;
And now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest;
For who lives longest him most ills molest.
Then see him, here he lies on bier for bet;—
Who will a shroud bestow on stranger dead?

A fair measure of the difference between Eastern and Western manners is afforded by such a theme being treated by their gravest writers and the verses being read and heard by the gravest and most worshipful men, whilst amongst us Preston and Chenery do not dare even to translate them. The latter, indeed, had all that immodest modesty for which English professional society is notable in this xixth century. He spoiled by needlessly excluding from a scientific publication (Mem. R.A.S.) all of my Proverbia Communia Syriaca (see Unexplored Sryia, i. 364) and every item which had a shade of double entendre. But Nemesis frequently found him out: during his short and obscure rule in Printing House Square, The Thunderer was distinguished by two of the foulest indecencies that ever appeared in an English paper.

The well-known Koranic verse, whereby Allah is introduced into an indecent tale and ""Holy Writ"" is punned upon. I have noticed (iii. 206) that victory Fat'h lit.=opening everything (as e.g. a maidenhead).

[FN#135] Egyptian and Syrian vulgar term for Mawálíyah or Mawáliyah, a short poem on subjects either classical or vulgar. It generally consists of five lines all rhyming except the penultimate. The metre is a species of the Basít which, however, admits of considerable poetical license; this being according to Lane the usual ""Weight,""

/ / / .

The scheme is distinctly anapæstic and Mr. Lyall (Translations of Ancient Arabic Poetry) compares with a cognate metre, the Tawíl, certain lines in Abt Vogler, e.g.

""Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told.""

[FN#136] i.e. repeat the chapter of the Koran termed The Opening, and beginning with these words, ""Have we not opened thy breast for thee and eased thee of thy burden which galled thy back? *** Verily with the difficulty cometh ease!""—Koran xciv. vol. 1, 5.

[FN#137] Lane renders Nur al-Hudà (Light of Salvation) by Light of Day which would be Nur al-Hadà.

[FN#138] In the Bresl. Edit. ""Yá Salám""=O safety!—a vulgar ejaculation.

[FN#139] A favourite idiom meaning from the mischief which may (or will) come from the Queen.

[FN#140] He is not strong-minded but his feminine persistency of purpose, likest to that of a sitting hen, is confirmed by the ""Consolations of religion."" The character is delicately drawn.

[FN#141] In token that she intended to act like a man.

[FN#142] This is not rare even in real life: Moslem women often hide and change their names for superstitious reasons, from the husband and his family.

[FN#143] Arab. ""Sabab"" which also means cause. Vol. ii. 14.
There is the same metaphorical use of ""Habl""= cord and cause.

[FN#144] Arab. ""Himà,"" a word often occurring in Arab poetry, domain, a pasture or watered land forcibly kept as far as a dog's bark would sound by some masterful chief like ""King Kulayb."" (See vol. ii. 77.) This tenure was forbidden by Mohammed except for Allah and the Apostle (i.e. himself). Lane translates it ""asylum.""

[FN#145] She was a maid and had long been of marriageable age.

[FN#146] The young man had evidently ""kissed the Blarney stone""; but the flattery is the more telling as he speaks from the heart.

[FN#147] ""Inshallah "" here being= D. V.

[FN#148] i.e. The ""Place of Light"" (Pharos), or of Splendour. Here we find that Hasan's wife is the youngest sister, but with an extraordinary resemblance to the eldest, a very masterful young person. The anagnorisis is admirably well managed.

[FN#149] i.e. the sweetmeats of the feast provided for the returning traveller. The old woman (like others) cannot resist the temptation of a young man's lips. Happily for him she goes so far and no farther.

[FN#150] The first, fourth, fifth and last names have already occurred: the others are in order, Star o' Morn, Sun of Undtirn and Honour of Maidenhood. They are not merely fanciful, but are still used in Egypt and Syria.

[FN#151] Arab. ""Fájirah"" and elsewhere ""Ahirah,"" =whore and strumpet used often in loose talk as mere abuse without special meaning.

[FN#152] This to Westerns would seem a most improbable detail, but Easterns have their own ideas concerning ""Al-Muhabbat al-ghariziyah"" =natural affection, blood speaking to blood, etc.

[FN#153] One of the Hells (see vol. iv. 143). Here it may be advisable to give the names of the Seven Heavens (which are evidently based upon Ptolemaic astronomy) and which correspond with the Seven Hells after the fashion of Arabian system-mania. (1) Dar al-Jalál (House of Glory) made of pearls; (2) Dár al-Salám (of Rest), rubies and jacinths; (3) Jannat al-Maawá (Garden of Mansions, not ""of mirrors,"" as Herklots has it, p. 98), made of yellow copper; (4) Jannat al-Khuld (of Eternity), yellow coral; (5) Jannat al-Na'ím (of Delights), white diamond; (6) Jannat al-Firdaus (of Paradise), red gold; and (7) Jannat al-'Adn (of Eden, or Al-Karár= of everlasting abode, which some make No. 8), of red pearls or pure musk. The seven Hells are given in vol. v. 241; they are intended for Moslems (Jahannam); Christians (Lazà); Jews (Hutamah); Sabians (Sa'ir); Guebles (Sakar); Pagans or idolaters (Jahím); and Hypocrites (Háwiyah).

[FN#154] Arab. ""'Atb,"" more literally= ""blame,"" ""reproach.""

[FN#155] Bresl. Edit. In the Mac. ""it returned to the place whence I had brought it""—an inferior reading.

[FN#156] The dreams play an important part in the Romances of Chivalry, e.g. the dream of King Perion in Amadis de Gaul, chapt. ii. (London; Longmans, 1803).

[FN#157] Amongst Moslems bastardy is a sore offence and a love-child is exceedingly rare. The girl is not only carefully guarded but she also guards herself knowing that otherwise she will not find a husband. Hence seduction is all but unknown. The wife is equally well guarded and lacks opportunities hence adultery is found difficult except in books. Of the Ibn (or Walad) Harám (bastard as opposed to the Ibn Halál) the proverb says, ""This child is not thine, so the madder he be the more is thy glee!"" Yet strange to say public prostitution has never been wholly abolished in Al-Islam. Al-Mas'údi tells us that in Arabia were public prostitutes'(Bagháyá), even before the days of the Apostle, who affected certain quarters as in our day the Tartúshah of Alexandria and the Hosh Bardak of Cairo. Here says Herr Carlo Landberg (p. 57, Syrian Proverbs) ""Elles parlent une langue toute à elle."" So pretentious and dogmatic a writer as the author of Proverbes et Dictons de la Province de Syrie, ought surely to have known that the Hosh Bardak is the head-quarters of the Cairene Gypsies. This author, who seems to write in order to learn, reminds me of an acute Oxonian undergraduate of my day who, when advised to take a ""coach,"" became a ""coach"" himself.

[FN#158] These lines occur in vol. vii. p. 340. I quote Mr.
Payne.

[FN#159] She shows all the semi-maniacal rancour of a good woman, or rather a woman who has not broken the eleventh commandment, ""Thou shalt not be found out,"" against an erring sister who has been discovered. In the East also these unco'gúid dames have had, and too often have, the power to carry into effect the cruelty and diabolical malignity which in London and Paris must vent itself in scan. mag. and anonymous letters.

[FN#160] These faintings and trances are as common in the Romances of Chivalry e.g. Amadis of Gaul, where they unlace the garments to give more liberty, pour cold water on the face and bathe the temples and pulses with diluted vinegar (for rose water) exactly as they do in The Nights.

[FN#161] So Hafiz, ""Bád-i-Sabá chu bugzarí"" etc.

[FN#162] Arab. ""Takiyah."" See vol. i. 224 and for the Tarn-Kappe vol. iv. p. 176. In the Sinthásana Dwatrinsati (vulgo. Singhásan Battísí), or Thirty-two Tales of a Throne, we find a bag always full of gold, a bottomless purse; earth which rubbed on the forehead overcomes all; a rod which during the first watch of the night furnishes jewelled ornaments; in the second a beautiful girl; in the third invisibility, and in the fourth a deadly foe or death; a flower-garland which renders the possessor invisible and an unfading lotus-flower which produces a diamond every day.

[FN#163] Arab. ""Judad,"" plur. of Jadíd, lit.= new coin, ergo applied to those old and obsolete; 10 Judad were= one nusf or half dirham.

[FN#164] Arab. ""Raff,"" a shelf proper, running round the room about 7-7½ feet from the ground. During my day it was the fashion in Damascus to range in line along the Raff splendid porcelain bowls brought by the Caravans in olden days from China, whilst on the table were placed French and English specimens of white and gold ""china"" worth perhaps a franc each.

[FN#165] Lane supposes that the glass and china-ware had fallen upon the divan running round the walls under the Raff and were not broken.

[FN#166] These lines have occurred in Night dclxxxix. vol. vii. p. 119. I quote Lane.

[FN#167] The lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.

[FN#168] This formula, I repeat, especially distinguishes the
Tale of Hasan of Bassorah.

[FN#169] These lines have occurred in vol. 1. 249. I quote Lane.

[FN#170] She speaks to the ""Gallery,"" who would enjoy a loud laugh against Mistress Gadabout. The end of the sentence must speak to the heart of many a widow.

[FN#171] These lines occur in vol. i. 25: so I quote Mr. Payne.

[FN#172] Arab. ""Musáhikah;"" the more usual term for a Tribade is ""Sahíkah"" from ""Sahk"" in the sense of rubbing: both also are applied to onanists and masturbators of the gender feminine.

[FN#173] i.e. by way of halter. This jar is like the cask in Auerbach's Keller; and has already been used by witches; Night dlxxxvii. vol. vi. 158.

[FN#174] Here they are ten but afterwards they are reduced to seven: I see no reason for changing the text with Lane and Payne.

[FN#175] Wazir of Solomon. See vol. i. 42; and vol. iii. 97.

[FN#176] Arab. ""Ism al-A'azam,"" the Ineffable Name, a superstition evidently derived from the Talmudic fancies of the Jews concerning their tribal god, Yah or Yahvah.

[FN#177] The tradition is that Mohámmed asked Akáf al-Wadá'ah ""Hast a wife?""; and when answered in the negative, ""Then thou appertainest to the brotherhood of Satans! An thou wilt be one of the Christian monks then company therewithal; but an thou be of us, know that it is our custom to marry!""

[FN#178] The old woman, in the East as in the West, being the most vindictive of her kind. I have noted (Pilgrimage iii. 70) that a Badawi will sometimes though in shame take the blood-wit; but that if it be offered to an old woman she will dash it to the ground and clutch her knife and fiercely swear by Allah that she will not eat her son's blood.

[FN#179] Neither dome nor fount etc. are mentioned before, the normal inadvertency.

[FN#180] In Eastern travel the rest comes before the eating and drinking.

[FN#181] Arab. ""'Id"" (pron.'Eed) which I have said (vol. i. 42, 317) is applied to the two great annual festivals, the ""Fête of Sacrifice,"" and the ""Break-Fast."" The word denotes restoration to favour and Moslems explain as the day on which Adam (and Eve) who had been expelled from Paradise for disobedience was re-established (Uída) by the relenting of Allah. But the name doubtless dates amongst Arabs from days long before they had heard of the ""Lord Nomenclator.""

[FN#182] Alluding to Hasan seizing her feather dress and so taking her to wife.

[FN#183] Arab. ""Kharajú""=they (masc.) went forth, a vulgarism for ""Kharajna"" (fem.)

[FN#184] Note the notable housewife who, at a moment when youth would forget everything, looks to the main chance.

[FN#185] Arab. ""Al-Malakút"" (not ""Malkút"" as in Freytag) a Sufi term for the world of Spirits (De Lacy Christ, Ar. i. 451). Amongst Eastern Christians it is vulgarly used in the fem. and means the Kingdom of Heaven, also the preaching of the Gospel.",Richard F. Burton,1976,"[98, 100]",2

Over my head, over my head, over my head
Over my head, over my head, over my head

[Verse 1]
There's only static on TV in this hotel room
Reminds me of all the things you think I don't understand
It seems like you and me, we keep losing connection
Whenever you talk to me, it doesn't make any sense

Don't know what you meant, it's always over my head
Yeah, over my head
Yeah, it's so

You take the simplest thing and always complicate it
Talking in circles, got me dizzy like a merry-go-round
It shouldn't be so hard to have a conversation
I'm sick of fighting with your ego, I wish you would admit

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I don't understand, it's always over my head
Yeah, over my head
Yeah, it's so

So tell me, tell me
Tell me all the things that you are thinking, thinking
Tell me what it is that I am missing, missing

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the ""situation is in control""
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire
I politely decline, I
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
And block out all the sadness

I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure

And we all march on like we know the way to Heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king?
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh

Touchdown like a whirlwind, I SHINE like lightning

Your terrible gaming has led you astray
When I hit the PK, I watch you decay
You're yelling mayday, there's no getting away
PK Thunder, Make it rain, you ain't never gonna be the same (uh huh)

Slim Oli, yo!
I'm an alien witta ship
I crash landed, broke the whip
I'm tryin' to get a grip, but I can't figure out which Pikmin is which (Too many colors!)
Even though I've got all these henchmen I still feel like ish (Tell 'em why!)
Cause all of these other characters are taller than me by, like, three fifths
Throws are legit, but my up-smash is my favorite to kill with
Go ahead, D.I. all you want (do it), there's still gonna be an ""E"" at the end of it (Bitch! Ha ha!)
You wanna melee? Forget it, I'd rather get lifted than fall
The only way they got me to brawl is cause they promised me there'd be tripping involved

Lord where's my good girl gone?
She was all I ever wanted
She was an angel for sure
She stands even now in my memory
So sweet and pure
But all that made me happy
Was a bottle and a song
Used to stay out drinkin'
While she cried all night long
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

She thought she could make me
Change in awhile so she learned
How to drink and she learned how to smile
I guess the pull of the bottle
Was just a little bit to strong
Now she's left me and
I don't know where she's gone
Amazing Grace, used to be her favorite song
Lord where's my good girl gone?

And then one night she said ""I'm goin'...""
But she didn't say where
It didn't seem to matter
And I didn't really care

Tear drops on the city
Bad Scooter searching for his groove
Seem like the whole world walking pretty
And you can't find the room to move
Well everybody better move over, that's all
'Cause I'm running on the bad side
And I got my back to the wall
Tenth Avenue freeze-out, Tenth Avenue freeze-out

[Verse 2]
I was stranded in the jungle
Tryin' to take in all the heat they was giving
The night is dark but the sidewalks bright
And lined with the light of the living
From a tenement window a transistor blasts
Turn around the corner things got real quiet real fast
I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out
Tenth Avenue freeze-out

And I'm all alone, I'm all alone
And kid you better get the picture
And I'm on my own, I'm on my own
And I can't go home

When the change was made uptown
And the Big Man joined the band
From the coastline to the city
All the little pretties raise their hands

Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s I was burned at the stake
Metaphor Mephistopheles, degrees I’ve achieved
The brain fluid it takes to believe would equal the seven seas
I could reveal the true name of God
But you would go insane upon hearing it
Release enough winds to blow down pyramids
I’m the Michelangelo of syllable
Since I freestyle Genesis been Biblical
That’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 1]
Since born in my mama vaginal sauna
As a sonogram, I been fond of phonics
It’s ironic, even as an embryonic
Fed through an umbilical—don’t that sound biblical?
I’ve been a terror since I teareth out of that uterus
Evil plans were made to defeat us as a fetus
Though now I walk in infamy, as a child they had it in for me
Was raised with guns in infantry in diapers at an infancy
The childhood of a hood that was raised in the hood
Cops said, put your hands in the hot sky
Threw my hands down on the hot hood
I can’t whine or drink wine, nine planets planned it
'Til it became apparent my parents shouldn’t have been a parent
State to state we ran some, I wasn’t worth no ransom
Money, won’t you hand some? A nigga wasn’t handsome
Raised the mind like Charles Manson’s Knew I was some man’s son, but which one?
That made me strong, created my poison tongue

[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes
Back in the 1800s I was burned at the stake

But you would go insane upon hearing it

Since I freestyle Genesis been Biblical
That’s something you got to give in to

[Verse 2]
While you cut school ‘cause you ain’t feel too good
I cut school ‘cause my cuts ain’t heal too good
Through all the physical abuse, my mind escaped through the gift of wordplay
I memorized encyclopedias and dictionaries
I wrote anthems from antonyms, harmonies from homonyms
Created cinema from synonyms, livid to eliminate that illustrious life you’re living in
Wrote rhetoricals in rhythms
I could paralyze with a parable, make rhymes out of religion
Crucify you with a prefix or suffocate you with a suffix
Wrote lectures so infectious that's known to infect the listeners
Who dissing us? Yo, punks, you wait; I punctuate
My karma’s the comma that put you inside of a coma
Hyphen, dot dot, semi-colon, leave you semi-swollen
Question mark, you pregnant? Oh, you’re not, I love you, period
To sum it up, language is my essence
Fucked up in all my adolescence 'til my moms was out of lessons
Laws, I store convenient, still I rob a convenience store
Love Mom/fuck Mom shit; I don’t love me no more
Mentally it didn’t register, bitch, empty the register, bitch!
You just a cashier, bitch, give the cash here!
Or I’ll shoot you in your cabbage, hijack a getaway cab, bitch
Words ain’t making me no loot, don’t change now Dow Jones average
Regardless, we’re Godless, they stole my innocence
In a sense, the judge sentenced me to three lifetimes sentences
To write my life and times in sentences, art my dark archnemesis
They want me off the premises, that’s what the premise is
Locked on a tier where you can’t shed a tear at
I studied more Shakespeare than any African shakes a spear at
And the whole world fears that and it hurts
I got caught killing time, but then I got away with words

[Hook]
Perfection, flawless, masterpiece, no mistakes

[Bridge]
People can say whatever they want about me
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
They can try to ignore everything that I’ve achieved
But agree that I am the Wordsmith
I am the Wordsmith
The love of words is deep in my veins
Must be to silence my pain; I am the Wordsmith

[Verse 3]
I’m in a game full of morons and they keep putting more on
I tutor the Torah, I’m in the core of the Koran
The mind’s what I represent and MCs better re-present
I’m taking this rapping bullshit to the fullest extent
I have reservations why Indians are on reservations
Told that board of education I was bored of education
As far as this go, I leave you deader than disco
Rocking sex and violence over sax and violins
Through your mind's camera lens you’re in need of an ambulance
I’ll knock you to the asphalt, it’s your own ass' fault
Your last thought, I’ll never sell myself short to be famous
And taking it up the anus just ain’t us
The world could get the penis of this classically trained pianist
My P.O. was p.o.’d, handed me a cup, told me to pee in this
The linguist musician, my college position is that my intuition
Told me I wouldn’t be affordin' tuition
My education’s all on my own
So I might have been born yesterday but I rhyme like there’s no tomorrow

Shouts and battle cries from ev'ry part
I can see those tears, ev'ry one is true
When the door appears I'll go right through

I stand in liquid light, like ev'ryone
I built my life with rhymes to carry on
And it gives me hope to see you there
The things I used to know, that one fine-

One fine day
One fine day

In a small dark room, where I will wait
Face to face I find, I contemplate
Even though a man, is made of clay
Ev'rything can change, one fine-

One fine day...

Then before my eyes is standing still
I beheld it there, a city on a hill
I complete my tasks one by one
I remove my masks when I am done

Then a piece of mind fell over me
In these troubled times, I still can see
We can use the stars to guide the way
It is not that far, one fine-

But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse

Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

[01. Intro]

[Kase.O: Intro]
Yeah! Lo que estás escuchando es Tutorial: La Mixtape
Javato Jones y Ambur Laineg en el edificio
¡Díselo bro!
Yeah, 2015, 2016, esto no para, co, esto no para

[Scratches R de Rumba]
Javat afecta, Rumba selecta (x4)
This is how it should be done
Puliendome a tontolabas, sin esfuerzo
This is how it should be done
(Kase.O) How can one man posess so much power?
This is how it should be done
True master, the teacher, that's right el maestro
This is how it should be done
Sobrazo de estilazo estoy puedes verlo
This is how it should be done
Todo un simbolo en el rap, después discute mi caché
This is how it should be done
Microphone master, super rhyme maker
This is how it should be done
(¡Qué bueno!) Rey del estilo, Kase.O
This is how it should be done
So however, wherever, whenever, heffer

[02. Eric B and Rakim - I Know You Got Soul]

[Kase.O] (Rap Solo Studio)

[Verso 1]
It’s been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I’m sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating, you miss
The rhymes from the microphone soloist
So you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker till you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a four letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it) soul
Ditects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, and let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck with
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up with
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def with the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done but only I can do it
For those that can't dance, just clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I’m trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme...
I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it
I know you got soul

[Verso 2]
Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I’m on Soul Train
But I wait cause I mastered this
Let the others go first so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (you got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I’ll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? then you gotta have soul
Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, cause that’s the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
(This is how it should be done) (x7)
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul

[Hook]
You got it
You got it
You got it
You got it

[03. Cloaka Company - Mc's De Mierda]

[Xhelazz]
Hey, hey, aquí chiqui chiqui chs, chiqui xhelazz
Ambur Laineg, Javato Jones
Máximo Respeto, co
Rap real, no fake. Tutorial ¡La Mixtape!

[FranFueTheFirst: Verso 1]
Mirad allá arriba al MC, dícese del que define
Aquel que solo presume, sé que rima tuves con su troupé
El que de lunes a lunes desune nubes de mugre
Cubre tu cumbre y se asume a tu muchedumbre
Al que para los del ca de blanco
Siéndoos francos Solo los jodo por no ser actor a tu ley
Poli hazme caso no comentes esto con tu mujer
Divergel, me dejé con ella en noches de gel
Así de fácil MTV, [?]
Mientras MCs sienten decir entre si, hoy es muy dificil su símil
Porque el feeling carga bien su sillín
Por eso estoy aquí, raps de mi ""rapdiaboli""
Que MC's de mierda montan las más guapas partys
Seduzco a tu chati y a su papi, rompemos ratings
Quitadme el lápiz, improvisando tanto rapper saben que mi canto
En cuanto saco mi metrallo, [?]
Mi actividad me ha hecho happy
Mi amistad con Javi me ha dictado
Que los bardos más heavys, más hippies, más prolíficos son piscis
Common también entra dentro de esta estadística, pero en fin
Estamos en el Spanish Tatami, to' el Dream Team
El resto en un momento dado es: A mi plin
Coge la rima y no la suelta como Erik B
De crio caí en la marmita como Obelix
Yo os libro de un vaso infinito
En harás el ridículo, hálito de MC's canijos
Pródigos en barcos, párrafos
Más no olvido que este príncipe en tiempo fue un sapo

[Hook] (x2)
MCs de mierda creen que saben rimar
MCs de mierda dan mal nombre al rap
MCs de mierda sin autoestima pa' copiar
MCs de mierda sois lo peor dejadlo ya

[Xhelazz: Verso 2]
Smoking Robinson, más Cruz que Penelope Cara
No matemático, no más mates que ya mal más [?]
Esta es mi secta, mi línea recta, Xhelazz te la inserta
Adicto a escribir en crisis de ahí que ahora comparo rimas
Las que nada dicen o las que te dictan las lágrimas
Si de unas a las otras la diferencia es abismal
Cloaka, su primer disco, el Hip Hop sufrirá reformas
Gota tras gota, la gota hará agujero en la roca
Vengo del planeta ""hardcorequiano"" que yo mismo defino
Siempre fui al revés del mundo, por nada me declino
Creí que era de noche estando a la sombra del pino
Pensé que era de día cuando la luz de las estrellas me iluminó
Mi estado moral metamórfico me transformó en meticuloso de métricas
Soy un cosmopolita en las técnicas
Vivo en un desierto pero mejor si soy optimista, ¿verdad?
Me consuelo imaginándome una playa sin mar
Mucha gente habla sola cuando en el váter caga su mierda
Si el váter es el que te habla, eso se llama esquizofrenia
Mi benevolencia es un pájaro herido por las envidias
Mujer, tú me querías, ¿por qué ahora de mi ni te fías?
Hacemos rap en la calle, ¿Sabes? O bajo tu ventana
El agua que chorrea en tus bragas tendidas nos hidrata
No eres tan fea como crees cuando te miras al espejo
Te eché una mano para complacerte y me sobraron 4 dedos
Co, tú eres mi flor y yo el florero con la facultad de florecer flows

[Hook] (x2)
MCs de mierda creen que saben rimar
MCs de mierda dan mal nombre al rap
MCs de mierda sin autoestima pa' copiar
MCs de mierda sois lo peor dejadlo ya

[Erik Beeler: Verso 3]
Tú coge la pana, yo levantaré la mano al sonar la campana
Tú habla, acapara
Pon la cara, yo pondré en tus narices una de mis cagadas
Sin mediar palabra
Tú consigue la fama, yo a mis movidas endiabladas
Atento aquí, traga
Sostén conmigo una mirada, vas del palo, co, vas de maca
Tu protege lo que tienes como si me importara
Sabes mejor que yo que tu movida es escasa
Tu saca tus armas, pasea tu cara como si nada
Yo me esconderé y realmente no quieres que salga
Tu no eres un real gato, eres más una real 'bufarra'
Que se escondía tras profesores en aulas, tú achanta
Crees que se ha ido Jesús y traiciona a sus espaldas
Estás destinado al karma
Al más profundo de los traumas
Estás jodido por bajar la guardia
No consigues bajar de tu parra
Yo estaré sumergido como mi aura en la cloaca, con mis ratas
Raps en los que dejo el alma y mis entrañas en la garganta
Tú crees que engañas, Yo seré aquel negrata
Que te sacará de entre las sabanas blancas. Buah, buah, ¡Cloaka!
(Puliéndome a tontolabas) (x7), chicos del barrio te como andar
Tú mantén la boca chapada, que estás más guapa
Yo con la rayada, tu movida no es tanta

[Hook] (x2)
MCs de mierda creen que saben rimar
MCs de mierda dan mal nombre al rap
MCs de mierda sin autoestima pa' copiar

Hell yeah, ram the one sell fare elsewhere
Put you and your family on welfare

Ready and willin to face you, death awaits you
The king piece in the chess game, to checkmate you

[Slick Rick]
Ooooooooooh, twist shot bitch, ?? voter ignores ??
Watch toys duck, consider rap's ultimate voicebox
Devour, and addressin dem coward
(How can one man posess so much power?) (x6)
Rhyme tearin through, bash all trifle
The eyes and spare a few assholes lives
This object -- brothers are glued to knob lick
'Scuse me, if I'm bein overly rude to public
The favorite -- make you fall in love, make whoever with
Clever kid, make you do the best steps you ever did
The trick is, managin to kick it
It's no such thing as challenging the Slickest
It's double-or-sure shot, crumble before spot
(I know) Must be humble before God
Ringing, cat must fear king-ing
Party over here, type atmosphere spinning

[Chorus: Canibus]
(Ricky D!) Rip it up, your watery blood
Ain't thick enough, yo wack niggas ain't slick enough
Ready and willin to face you, death awaits you

[Slick Rick]
Ooooooooooh, I toy your cheddar top-netter
You find me a human being, boy or girl bet-ter
It's short son -- nurse and them soundkick bark on
Stop talk, stop worshipin the ground Rick walk on
Bitch play number one bougie
Wish they could give motherfucker some pussy
Seen the face of supreme in tasteness
Never see another human being this greatness
Successful, and the hype is effectful and
Sorry God if bein any type disrespectful and
Hip-hop, assume pop's acquited
Now with tick-tock, you don't stop, hit it!
Command Rick, shower the firmament
Earnin it, tremendous power is permanent
Unless frame interest dame
Let's name who the king piece in the chess game

[05. Ossian - ""Freestyle"" (Exclusivo)]

[Intro: Ossian]
Hey, hey, hey, ¿Qué pasa hermanos?
Mi nombre es Ossian, esto es Tutorial Mixtape
Ambur Laineg y Javato Jones pa tus oídos

[Verso]
Me he levantado por la mañana y vuelta a empezar
Uno tras otro, de carrerilla y sin parar
Noté enseguida, sin flujo mi cerebro a cien
Con este estilo rimamos los que rimamos bien
Esto no va a ser dulce, no te confundas
Son ritos y hierbajos, del Asia profunda
Medidas inexactas en potes de conservas
Hace que en la ciudad, haya monos como en selvas
En bacanales griegas declinando mis palabras
Quizás hinquen el codo o inclinados sobre camas
Igual son demasiao' jóvenes
Nos enseñaron a sumar y a restar, pero no a ser hombres
No dan diplomas por echarle cojones
Tampoco flores ni trofeos por salir con moratones
Mi léxico no es el de un hombre docto
Pero los rappers en la calle propagan las posturas que adopto
Besé sus manos, puse flores en su tumba
Limpié su cuerpo, mecí su cuna
Me preocupa quedarme mudo o sordo
No el estampado del envoltorio, si el albornoz es blanco y rojo
Amamos a las máquinas y no escribimos páginas
Por eso siempre falta la tilde de tus lágrimas
Antes de ver mundo dejarás de ser crisálida
Cada vez que pase el tiempo serás polvo y una lápida
Mi hermano Kase.O en el 2016
Sacará el disco del siglo chicos, ya lo veréis
Es un emérito en el mérito, Mc's irán al médico
Tan solo con que piquen este inédito, doy crédito
Si el hierro derretimos y crepita la madera
Ignorantes y eruditos convencemos de cualquier manera
Mundos escondidos como en túneles de montes andinos
Miles de caminos, quiero que hagas conmigo
Y alejarte de lo amargo, de lo que hace daño
Verás cuando comprendas que no hay uno si no muchos planos
Lucho por mi padre que ha currao' 40 años
Y por su dignidad como humano cuando llegue a anciano...

[06. Jeru The Damaja - Come Clean]

[Verso 1]
You wanna front—what? Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake-gangster emcees and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave comp defunct
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
(I'm a true master, you can check my credentials) (x4)
'Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
'Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and it's nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook sampleado] (x5)
Uh-oh! Heads up 'cause we're dropping some shit!

[Verso 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle

[07. Mellow Man Ace - The Brother With Two Tongues]

[Sho-Hai]
Eyou, eyou, aquí Sho Hai al habla
Rey de cantinas directamente desde el Big Deli
Zaragoza Ciudad, Rap Solo
Mucho amor y admiración para Ambur Laineg y Kase.O
Atiende, escucha y siente. ¡Paz!

[08. Violadores del Verso - Moved El Ano]

[Sho Hai: Estrofa 1]
Nunca ando solo, Violadores a mi espalda
Guardan al Hate, son ángeles sin alas
Siempre nos veras en el bar, así nos llaman
Apodados de borrachos van, Bufank
En la tasca gasto mis jornales
Chavales invierten en alcohol para pasarlo en grande
Yo soy uno de ellos, siempre rulo litracos
Y a demás los cachis son minis, van a dentro y a saco
No busco calidad, no, grandes cantidades, si
Dame elixir, siempre es lo mismo en fin
Somos sosos, no pretendas tener un rato agradable con nosotros
Preferirás mas estar solo, os lo aseguro, muchos desistieron
Y otros tantos que se acercan, espera, tiempo al tiempo
Celebro derrotas con mis copas
Y brindo por mi éxito y el futuro con mi esposa
Pasión por la vida aún me queda
¿que se puede esperar de un ser como yo que no se esmera?
Mi misión es violar versos, todo mi empeño esta puesto en esto
Hago mover anos a cientos, a diestro y siniestro
Somos normales, como todo el mundo
Bueno, tenemos un talento especial, eso seguro
La gente me coloca en podios por mi mierda
Les gusta menear el culo a base de mis letras
Dicen que después de la tempestad viene calma
Pues calma y espera sentado la tromba de mi banda
Rompiendo dichos, rompiendo esquemas
Cambiando leyes, cambiando las reglas
Aquellos que al Hate tocaronle las bolas
Ahora me lloran, pues que se jodan
Nunca ando solo, cabrones
Nunca ando solo, a mis espaldas violadores
Bufones de la corte, memos
Hacéis reír al rey de las cantinas con gracietas de versos
Y es lamentable que MCs de poca monta hablen
Hasta el rebuzno de un burro encuentro mas agradable
De eso que tu tanto careces yo lo tengo
De eso que tu tienes yo no lo quiero ¿pa que?
(Sobrado de estilazo estoy, puedes verlo) (x6)
Y tu no ves mi cielo
Cien por cien hago poner bien
El mejor MC del mundo posiblemente como la Carlsberg
Sobredosis de buen rap inyecto por mis venas
Como yonquis en el Ebro en su ribera espera
Bufank que engancha, soy jeringo y pincho
Tienes bonarro de escuchar al mago y a sus chicos
Tranquilo chaval que es normal y al final
Acabaras siendo un fan de los Bufank
Solo con escuchar el nombre de violadores, MCs corren
Zorras tapan sus chochos y esconden, cojonuda
No hay mejor definición para la mierda esta
Moved el ano y cabeza, esa es mi meta
Se me presenta en escenarios como el rey de las cantinas
El respetable Hate al suelo suelta papillas
Anonadados después del espectáculo
Estas con los grandes dioses en el oráculo

[Estribillo: Sho Hai] (x2)
Nunca ando solo
Nunca ando solo, siempre con mis hombres
Nunca ando solo
Nunca ando solo, a mis espaldas Violadores

[09. E.L. Aitor - Freestyle (Exclusivo)]

[Intro: E.L Aitor]
El Aitor, Zaragoza, Tutorial: La Mixtape
Las Huellas de Barro represento tío
Milimetriks

[Verso]
Soy El Aitor y hoy estoy en Rap Solo
Controlo el tutorial que sigues
Con todo el arsenal y no haces na' contra estos pives
Si oyes pero no escuchas, existes y no vives
Miras pero no ves, ¿entonces por qué escribes?
Dime si ves diferencias entre entre esclavos y hombres libres
Son tres; Apréndelas, luego decide
Primera: Un esclavo se creé libre, el libre es al revés se creé esclavo
Es raro pero así es después, claro
La segunda es que unos distinguen
Algo que es imposible de algo que aún no han intentado
Los otros se han quedado bajo su tejado
Ellos han hecho al amo y no al revés
Yo y el sutecho es, yo el sujeto de este suceso pues
Te confieso que no sé cual es la número tres
¡Yo! Lo que sí que sé eso es un buen flow
MC's pedís un S.O.S y digo Let's go!
Eyou, Kase.O, Rumba y yo
El retorno del boom bap, rap para tu cuello
Rapper no me ladres, a ti te copian los chiquillos
Y yo ya era imitado por sus padres...

[10. Violadores del Verso - Prestigio Intocable]

[Lírico: Estribillo] (x2)
¿De dónde sale este tipo?
¿Dónde se mete este tipo
¿Quién es este tipo?
Intocable, intocable
Dale prestigio intocable a este tipo!

[Verso 2]
Mientras principiantes cogen el micrófono con optimismo
Yo sigo siendo el mismo, yo sigo siendo el mismo
Serio, puliendo mi prosa
Y asumiendo comentarios que sólo corresponden a diosas
Porque nadie conoce a Lírico, sin palabras
De admiración detrás, resulta ser obsesión
Por Lírico en el microfón
Manejo sexxxy, en el sexo, al son de un saxofón
Sólo trato de vender mi casette
(Todo un símbolo en el rap después discute mi caché) (x6)
Un tipo de carne y hueso qué tiene de increíble
Bajo sospecha tienes mi sonrisa inconfundible
Me mantengo en forma, guerras con el diablo
No más, sólo formas, de obtener diplomas
Personal e intransferible mi movida porque
Tengo mi polla, acá en la retaguardia mi prole
No encajo críticas, ya que sé de batallas
Sé de victorias, estadísticas demuestran
Soy musa de misses, soy culpable de tus días grises
Sólo astros provocan eclipses
Cuando el fin del milenio estar próximo
Yo salí de lo anónimo, sin pisar prójimo
Sólo intocables andan de forma épica
Sólo algo complicado es comparable a mi métrica
Mi vida es acción, devaneos, y en parábolas De Biblias
Trato mantener suspense
Sólo llevo mi arrogancia al extremo
Yo supremo, tu pillas mi flow como demo
No me adapto a moldes, sólo robo protagonismo y fama
Ya de crío planeaba golpes
Intocable, Intocable
R de Rumba en el corte

[Estribillo] (x2)
¿De dónde sale este tipo?
¿Dónde se mete este tipo
¿Quién es este tipo?
Intocable, intocable
¡Dale prestigio intocable a este tipo!

[11. Run D.M.C - Here We Go - Live At The Funhouse]

[Run-D.M.C.]
Here we go.. here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we here we here we go
D.M.C. and DJ Run, dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We're rockin on the mic and then you know where we're from
Dum diddy-dum diddy-diddy-dum-dum
We hope y'all ready for the big beat drum
Drum diddy-drum diddy-diddy-drum-drum
So people in the place here the big beat come
Here it come, here it come, here it kiddi-come-come
Come on everybody let's all get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
We make up all these rhymes inside our head
The other MC's cannot compete
When we rap on the mic to this big beat
The beat is big it's kind of large
And when we're on the mic, WE'RE IN CHARGE!

[Run]
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that-a-tha-that, a-like that y'all (that y'all)
Cool chief rocker, I don't drink vodka
But keep a bag of cheeba inside my locker (HUH!)
Go to school everyday (HUH!)
Always time to get paid (HA HUH!)
Cause I'm rockin on the mic until the break of day

[D.M.C.]
And now the things I do make me a star
And you can be too if know who you are
Just put your mind to it, you'll go real far
And the next thing you know you'll have a big car

[Run - overlaps]
A-liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy
Listen to the beat, here I say
Because it's not routine, it's the way I play (Hahh-AHH)
Spit come out my mouth all time of the day; a then ahh
And most the time, Jam Master Jay

[D.M.C.]
Hey they used to call me Easy Dee
Because I rapped on the mic so easily
But now they call me D.M.C
(HE'S) D.M.C. of the par-ty
The D's for doin it all of the time
M is for the rhymes, that are all mine
C's for cool cool as can be
(And why you wear those glasses?) So I can see!

[Run]
Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore
Rhymes that you've never even heard before
Now if you say you heard my rhyme, we gonna have to fight
Cause I just made the motherfuckers up last night
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet
Party on down to the DJ Run beat
The beat to get you up and get you outta your seat
Make you boogie to this (party) cause you know it's unique
Wait a tiny minute, don't break on me
My rhymes come faster as the DJ Cheese
The DJ cuts the record for the valley below
Then I boogie your ass, til it's time to go
And when it's time to go GIRLS, takin you home
So straighten your dress up, bout your hair use a comb

[D.M.C.]
Well I'm the (microphone master, super rhyme maker) (x4)

[12. La Puta Opp ft. Dobleache, Kase.O y Dave Bee - Pásatelo]

[Hermano L]
Eyou, esto de aquí es el Hermano L desde esa Puta OPP, Raggaflá, Cuñaos del Fonk, mandandola para Ambur Laineg y Javato Jones, ¿okey?
Tutorial es el nombre de esta mixtape, you must listen
Porque este es el sonido que es rey ¡esta es la puta ley!

[Intro: Hermano L]
Pasate el micrófono 2, Dave...
¡Porque esto no se pue parar!

[Verso 1: Hermano L]
El show de esta noche pue ser la bomba
Aquí en el micro están los que más rezumban
Kase, Dave Bee, Dobleache y Domba
Están sudando aquí para ponerte en forma
Ya sabes, local del 16 en mi norma
Yo soy el rey de la fonky conga
En un retrete encontrarás poco que aprovechar
Pero mi mierda mueve al público de este y aquel lugar
Pilla tu microonda y hazlo con frecuencia
Frank T sigue siendo negro y no es solo apariencia
Esta no engaña y la OPP es la caña de España
Así que limpia tus legañas
Yo me lo monto en el asto
Sueno en tu compacto
Tengo a buena vista, buen tasto
Es pincho como un gasto
Te lo he dicho jamás de retracto
Mi artefacto te salva del infarto

[Dobleache Puente]
¿quién tiene el micrófono?
¿quién me va a dar el micrófono?

[Verso 2: Dobleache]
Ya era hora de que me pasarais el micrófono
Hice un hueco en mi agenda
Isleños de postín con la Abenia en mi pre-venda
Traigo a la orden del ida el desorden de la noche
La mejor babachadara gris de bibaboche
Y oliendo así gusto de pocos, cosas de locos
Prestidigitador del lenguaje con estos otros
Moscas ya conocen la salida de su frasco
Tú busca comparar repara y vigila el gasto
Colgado así de los pulgares
Viejas estampas familiares
Carambola que no harás en tus billares
Esta vez no estimularé vesículas biliares
Son Los Cuñaos del Fonk
Anfitriones estelares y es que:
¡Mallorca es fonky!, ¡Muy fonky!
Que lo sepan de Gomera a Donosti
Es trabajo de campo dejar el listón hoy arriba
Conjurando caras largas, ¿quién derrocha más saliva?
Es coser y cantar, puntadas con hilo como acostumbra
Este arco-iris del color de la penumbra
Sigue echándome de comer aparte
Que de eso se trata
Otro pastel, otra guinda, cosas de una vida en plata

[Verso 3: EL Xarro de las Calaveras]
Vosis doble intraefecta, deken fuerta boo!
Fenómenos en losta, weinersubakana
Viva el almibar
Firukoman galáctico más
Simpra quesute fundao'
Dame veneno rascao'
¡For cañí! Al gran Xinarro de las Calaveras
Trabuco rojo de los clubs de carretera
Bajarisimo trepa, secando whisky
Modorros niquelaos' paroniliski
Vacilando el estucao', con terciopelo forrao'
El artefacto metálico se ha quedao matizao'
Está domao', cromao', satinao', quemao', fundio'
Las zapas cabronas y lascheia no te han servido
Chatos metiendo brío y perros bien nutrios'
Los luchadores mancos a la serpiente han mentio'
Conamndo Shuriken, estrategia [?]
Canapés adobaos' de mal parios

[Hate y Kase.O: Puente]
¿Qué, qué? Violadores
Es la Doble V, te lo pone ahí
En la isla macho, Sí Mallorca es Fonky...

[Verso 4: Kase.O]
Co, pásate el micrófono, vengo a tope con O Doble P
Jódete, antes de que Kase haga check
Dí que sí, como no, pasale el micrófono
(Al rey del estilo tiene nombre: Kase.O) (x4)
Voy pa allá, ¿puedes competir o mejor callar?
Tú, quieres mi elixir, yo te lo voy a dar
Ven, quién, trajo rimas al micro, suave
Como el mar se lo hizo a la orilla... ¡ya tu sabes co!
Mi estilo es vacilón, no facilón, es mi filón
Que haces ahí jilon, pon más Don Simon
En la isla, aislado, atmósfera
¿Es mi funeral? Ya se verá
Pero hoy mi estilo es libre
Libre como el viento y el verano

[Keith Murray]
Yo, hey yo, I step out the shell like a black pearl
Become the destroyer of all worlds
I eat you inside out like stress
The best, I never lose a rhyme contest
While troublesome black rolls flows
Bleed internal external like a bloody nose
Props grow like crops
Desert boot Clarks wit no socks
Parking space killer stay out my lot
You hear my voice, you see my face, you know my name
I take it out your ass and charge it to the game
I battle with words, go to war with ideas
You defeat me never in a million years
The factor of the rapture
Is that you either get killed, wound, or captured
They shoot you up so bad til the end you fought
But then you got caught up in my final thought

Con to'l cariño

[Verso]
Sé que esperáis buenas rimotas
Yo siento vuestro hambre como el mío
Más no os queráis meter en las botas
De un rompedor de cotas, un domador de OVNIs
Mediante astro-lenguaje, ese es mi extraño bagaje
No puedes subir mis notas
Soy un maestro, dejo el texto lleno de derrotas
Voy con lo puesto pues me atrae mucho el lujo idiotas
Suelen cambiar su rap por un flujo promesas rotas y mal caviar
Mientras sueltas esas rimas flojas, ¿de qué te quejas?
¿Te has parado a revisar tus hojas? ¿Lo que reflejas?
Lo que pienso yo es que estás perdido, estás jodido
No has medido en que te has metido en tremendo lío

554,Don't Cry Joni,"[Verse 1: Conway]
Joni was the girl who lived next door
I've known her I guess ten years or more
Joni wrote me a note one day
And this is what she had to say

[Chorus: Joni Lee]
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

[Verse 3: Conway]
Slowly I read her note once more
Then I went over to the house next door
Her teardrops fell like rain that day
When I told Joni what I had to say

[Verse 4: Conway]
Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
You're just fifteen I'm twenty-two
And Joni I just can't wait for you

[Verse 5: Conway]
Soon I left our little hometown
Got me a job and tried to settle down
But these words kept haunting my memory
The words that Joni said to me

[Chorus: Joni Lee]
Jimmy please say you'll wait for me
I'll grow up someday you'll see
Saving all my kisses just for you
Signed with love, forever true

[Verse 6: Conway]
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane
I had to see Joni I had to explain
How my heart was filled with her memory
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me

[Verse 7: Conway]
I ran all the way to the house next door
But things weren't like they were before
My teardrops fell like rain that day
When I heard what Joni had to say

[Verse 8: Joni Lee]
Jimmy, Jimmy please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by
It's been five years since you've been gone

555,That's Why I Love You,"[Verse 1: SiR]
Doesn't it feel like this could be real life?
If we had somethin’ to prove
Life would be normal, dinner formal
I could be happy with you
Primitive passion, human reactions
Puttin' it all on the line
This could be real life, but why do I feel like
We would be wastin' our time?

[Pre-Chorus: SiR & Sabrina Claudio]
See, it’s the same thing, no rules
Same rhythm, new blues
Same love, but this time it really ain't love
No reason, no rhyme
No speakin' our mind
No war, that isn't what we came for

[Chorus: SiR]
I never wondered what this could be
I just fuck you and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me
I just fuck you and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just fuck you and leave, yeah
There ain't really nothin' to see
That’s why I love you

[Verse 2: Sabrina Claudio]
Couldn’t you picture us givin' into love?
Breakin’ down all of my walls
You would be faithful, honest, and grateful
Probably answer whenever I call
I couldn't handle being disloyal
Unintentionally break us apart
Nor could I measure the level of pressure
I'd be under, protectin' your heart

[Pre-Chorus: SiR & Sabrina Claudio]
See, it’s the same thing, new rules
Same rhythm, new blues
Same love, but this time it really ain't love
No reason, no rhyme
No speakin' our mind
No war, that isn't what we came for

[Chorus: Sabrina Claudio]
I never wondered what this could be
I sit on it and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me
I sit on it and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just sit on it and leave
There ain't really nothin' to see
That's why I love you

[Bridge: SiR, Sabrina Claudio & Both]
We would be more if I could deal with the pain (But I can't)
Survive another tumble down lover's lane (We remain)
The brightest color in an ocean of grey
Ain't the same if I cared, ain't the same if you stayed
What we were doin' wouldn't make it okay (But how)
Could it be better when we're makin' a wave (No, I)
Don't want your heart if you can take it away
It's a better affair when there's nothing to say
Yeah

[Chorus: SiR, Sabrina Claudio & Both]
I never wondered what this could be (I never wondered what)
I just fuck you and leave
You never wanted nothin' from me (Oh, oh)
I just fuck you and leave
We don't ever come to agree
I just fuck you and leave, yeah
There ain't really nothin' to see",SiR,1976,"[68, 68, 74, 78, 84]",5
556,I Could Have Danced All Night/Jump For Joy,"""One evening as I was lying flat on the deck of my steamboat, I heard voices approaching -- and there were the nephew and the uncle strolling along the bank. I laid my head on my arm again, and had nearly lost myself in a doze, when somebody said in my ear, as it were: 'I am as harmless as a little child, but I don't like to be dictated to. Am I the manager -- or am I not? I was ordered to send him there. It's incredible.' . . . I became aware that the two were standing on the shore alongside the forepart of the steamboat, just below my head. I did not move; it did not occur to me to move: I was sleepy. 'It IS unpleasant,' grunted the uncle. 'He has asked the Administration to be sent there,' said the other, 'with the idea of showing what he could do; and I was instructed accordingly. Look at the influence that man must have. Is it not frightful?' They both agreed it was frightful, then made several bizarre remarks: 'Make rain and fine weather -- one man -- the Council -- by the nose' -- bits of absurd sentences that got the better of my drowsiness, so that I had pretty near the whole of my wits about me when the uncle said, 'The climate may do away with this difficulty for you. Is he alone there?' 'Yes,' answered the manager; 'he sent his assistant down the river with a note to me in these terms: ""Clear this poor devil out of the country, and don't bother sending more of that sort. I had rather be alone than have the kind of men you can dispose of with me."" It was more than a year ago. Can you imagine such impudence!' 'Anything since then?' asked the other hoarsely. 'Ivory,' jerked the nephew; 'lots of it -- prime sort -- lots -- most annoying, from him.' 'And with that?' questioned the heavy rumble. 'Invoice,' was the reply fired out, so to speak. Then silence. They had been talking about Kurtz.

""I was broad awake by this time, but, lying perfectly at ease, remained still, having no inducement to change my position. 'How did that ivory come all this way?' growled the elder man, who seemed very vexed. The other explained that it had come with a fleet of canoes in charge of an English half-caste clerk Kurtz had with him; that Kurtz had apparently intended to return himself, the station being by that time bare of goods and stores, but after coming three hundred miles, had suddenly decided to go back, which he started to do alone in a small dugout with four paddlers, leaving the half-caste to continue down the river with the ivory. The two fellows there seemed astounded at anybody attempting such a thing. They were at a loss for an adequate motive. As to me, I seemed to see Kurtz for the first time. It was a distinct glimpse: the dugout, four paddling savages, and the lone white man turning his back suddenly on the headquarters, on relief, on thoughts of home -- perhaps; setting his face towards the depths of the wilderness, towards his empty and desolate station. I did not know the motive. Perhaps he was just simply a fine fellow who stuck to his work for its own sake. His name, you understand, had not been pronounced once. He was 'that man.' The half-caste, who, as far as I could see, had conducted a difficult trip with great prudence and pluck, was invariably alluded to as 'that scoundrel.' The 'scoundrel' had reported that the 'man' had been very ill -- had recovered imperfectly. . . . The two below me moved away then a few paces, and strolled back and forth at some little distance. I heard: 'Military post -- doctor -- two hundred miles -- quite alone now -- unavoidable delays -- nine months -- no news -- strange rumours.' They approached again, just as the manager was saying, 'No one, as far as I know, unless a species of wandering trader -- a pestilential fellow, snapping ivory from the natives.' Who was it they were talking about now? I gathered in snatches that this was some man supposed to be in Kurtz's district, and of whom the manager did not approve. 'We will not be free from unfair competition till one of these fellows is hanged for an example,' he said. 'Certainly,' grunted the other; 'get him hanged! Why not? Anything -- anything can be done in this country. That's what I say; nobody here, you understand, HERE, can endanger your position. And why? You stand the climate -- you outlast them all. The danger is in Europe; but there before I left I took care to -- ' They moved off and whispered, then their voices rose again. 'The extraordinary series of delays is not my fault. I did my best.' The fat man sighed. 'Very sad.' 'And the pestiferous absurdity of his talk,' continued the other; 'he bothered me enough when he was here. ""Each station should be like a beacon on the road towards better things, a centre for trade of course, but also for humanizing, improving, instructing."" Conceive you -- that ass! And he wants to be manager! No, it's -- ' Here he got choked by excessive indignation, and I lifted my head the least bit. I was surprised to see how near they were -- right under me. I could have spat upon their hats. They were looking on the ground, absorbed in thought. The manager was switching his leg with a slender twig: his sagacious relative lifted his head. 'You have been well since you came out this time?' he asked. The other gave a start. 'Who? I? Oh! Like a charm -- like a charm. But the rest -- oh, my goodness! All sick. They die so quick, too, that I haven't the time to send them out of the country -- it's incredible!' 'Hm'm. Just so,' grunted the uncle. 'Ah! my boy, trust to this -- I say, trust to this.' I saw him extend his short flipper of an arm for a gesture that took in the forest, the creek, the mud, the river -- seemed to beckon with a dishonouring flourish before the sunlit face of the land a treacherous appeal to the lurking death, to the hidden evil, to the profound darkness of its heart. It was so startling that I leaped to my feet and looked back at the edge of the forest, as though I had expected an answer of some sort to that black display of confidence. You know the foolish notions that come to one sometimes. The high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience, waiting for the passing away of a fantastic invasion.

""They swore aloud together -- out of sheer fright, I believe -- then pretending not to know anything of my existence, turned back to the station. The sun was low; and leaning forward side by side, they seemed to be tugging painfully uphill their two ridiculous shadows of unequal length, that trailed behind them slowly over the tall grass without bending a single blade.

""In a few days the Eldorado Expedition went into the patient wilderness, that closed upon it as the sea closes over a diver. Long afterwards the news came that all the donkeys were dead. I know nothing as to the fate of the less valuable animals. They, no doubt, like the rest of us, found what they deserved. I did not inquire. I was then rather excited at the prospect of meeting Kurtz very soon. When I say very soon I mean it comparatively. It was just two months from the day we left the creek when we came to the bank below Kurtz's station.

""Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest. The air was warm, thick, heavy, sluggish. There was no joy in the brilliance of sunshine. The long stretches of the water- way ran on, deserted, into the gloom of over-shadowed distances. On silvery sand-banks hippos and alligators sunned themselves side by side. The broadening waters flowed through a mob of wooded islands; you lost your way on that river as you would in a desert, and butted all day long against shoals, trying to find the channel, till you thought yourself bewitched and cut off for ever from everything you had known once -- somewhere -- far away -- in another existence perhaps. There were moments when one's past came back to one, as it will sometimes when you have not a moment to spare for yourself; but it came in the shape of an unrestful and noisy dream, remembered with wonder amongst the overwhelming realities of this strange world of plants, and water, and silence. And this stillness of life did not in the least resemble a peace. It was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention. It looked at you with a vengeful aspect. I got used to it afterwards; I did not see it any more; I had no time. I had to keep guessing at the channel; I had to discern, mostly by inspiration, the signs of hidden banks; I watched for sunken stones; I was learning to clap my teeth smartly before my heart flew out, when I shaved by a fluke some infernal sly old snag that would have ripped the life out of the tin-pot steamboat and drowned all the pilgrims; I had to keep a lookout for the signs of dead wood we could cut up in the night for next day's steaming. When you have to attend to things of that sort, to the mere incidents of the surface, the reality -- the reality, I tell you -- fades. The inner truth is hidden -- luckily, luckily. But I felt it all the same; I felt often its mysterious stillness watching me at my monkey tricks, just as it watches you fellows performing on your respective tight-ropes for -- what is it? half-a-crown a tumble -- ""

""Try to be civil, Marlow,"" growled a voice, and I knew there was at least one listener awake besides myself

""I beg your pardon. I forgot the heartache which makes up the rest of the price. And indeed what does the price matter, if the trick be well done? You do your tricks very well. And I didn't do badly either, since I managed not to sink that steamboat on my first trip. It's a wonder to me yet. Imagine a blindfolded man set to drive a van over a bad road. I sweated and shivered over that business considerably, I can tell you. After all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that's supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin. No one may know of it, but you never forget the thump -- eh? A blow on the very heart. You remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and think of it -- years after -- and go hot and cold all over. I don't pretend to say that steamboat floated all the time. More than once she had to wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing. We had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. Fine fellows -- cannibals -- in their place. They were men one could work with, and I am grateful to them. And, after all, they did not eat each other before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my nostrils. Phoo! I can sniff it now. I had the manager on board and three or four pilgrims with their staves -- all complete. Sometimes we came upon a station close by the bank, clinging to the skirts of the unknown, and the white men rushing out of a tumble-down hovel, with great gestures of joy and surprise and welcome, seemed very strange -- had the appearance of being held there captive by a spell. The word ivory would ring in the air for a while -- and on we went again into the silence, along empty reaches, round the still bends, between the high walls of our winding way, reverberating in hollow claps the ponderous beat of the stern-wheel. Trees, trees, millions of trees, massive, immense, running up high; and at their foot, hugging the bank against the stream, crept the little begrimed steamboat, like a sluggish beetle crawling on the floor of a lofty portico. It made you feel very small, very lost, and yet it was not altogether depressing, that feeling. After all, if you were small, the grimy beetle crawled on -- which was just what you wanted it to do. Where the pilgrims imagined it crawled to I don't know. To some place where they expected to get something. I bet! For me it crawled towards Kurtz -- exclusively; but when the steam-pipes started leaking we crawled very slow. The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there. At night sometimes the roll of drums behind the curtain of trees would run up the river and remain sustained faintly, as if hovering in the air high over our heads, till the first break of day. Whether it meant war, peace, or prayer we could not tell. The dawns were heralded by the descent of a chill stillness; the wood-cutters slept, their fires burned low; the snapping of a twig would make you start. We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grass-roofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage. The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy. The pre-historic man was cursing us, praying to us, welcoming us -- who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse. We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign -- and no memories.

""The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there -- there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were -- No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it -- this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity -- like yours -- the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you -- you so remote from the night of first ages -- could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything -- because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future. What was there after all? Joy, fear, sorrow, devotion, valour, rage -- who can tell? -- but truth -- truth stripped of its cloak of time. Let the fool gape and shudder -- the man knows, and can look on without a wink. But he must at least be as much of a man as these on the shore. He must meet that truth with his own true stuff -- with his own in-born strength. Principles won't do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags -- rags that would fly off at the first good shake. No; you want a deliberate belief. An appeal to me in this fiendish row -- is there? Very well; I hear; I admit, but I have a voice, too, and for good or evil mine is the speech that cannot be silenced. Of course, a fool, what with sheer fright and fine sentiments, is always safe. Who's that grunting? You wonder I didn't go ashore for a howl and a dance? Well, no -- I didn't. Fine sentiments, you say? Fine sentiments, be hanged! I had no time. I had to mess about with white-lead and strips of woolen blanket helping to put bandages on those leaky steam-pipes -- I tell you. I had to watch the steering, and circumvent those snags, and get the tin-pot along by hook or by crook. There was surface-truth enough in these things to save a wiser man. And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman. He was an improved specimen; he could fire up a vertical boiler. He was there below me, and, upon my word, to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat, walking on his hind-legs. A few months of training had done for that really fine chap. He squinted at the steam-gauge and at the water-gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity -- and he had filed teeth, too, the poor devil, and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns, and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks. He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank, instead of which he was hard at work, a thrall to strange witchcraft, full of improving knowledge. He was useful because he had been instructed; and what he knew was this -- that should the water in that transparent thing disappear, the evil spirit inside the boiler would get angry through the greatness of his thirst, and take a terrible vengeance. So he sweated and fired up and watched the glass fearfully (with an impromptu charm, made of rags, tied to his arm, and a piece of polished bone, as big as a watch, stuck flatways through his lower lip), while the wooded banks slipped past us slowly, the short noise was left behind, the interminable miles of silence -- and we crept on, towards Kurtz. But the snags were thick, the water was treacherous and shallow, the boiler seemed indeed to have a sulky devil in it, and thus neither that fireman nor I had any time to peer into our creepy thoughts.

""Some fifty miles below the Inner Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole, with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it, and a neatly stacked wood-pile. This was unexpected. We came to the bank, and on the stack of firewood found a flat piece of board with some faded pencil-writing on it. When deciphered it said: 'Wood for you. Hurry up. Approach cautiously.' There was a signature, but it was illegible -- not Kurtz -- a much longer word. 'Hurry up.' Where? Up the river? 'Approach cautiously.' We had not done so. But the warning could not have been meant for the place where it could be only found after approach. Something was wrong above. But what -- and how much? That was the question. We commented adversely upon the imbecility of that telegraphic style. The bush around said nothing, and would not let us look very far, either. A torn curtain of red twill hung in the doorway of the hut, and flapped sadly in our faces. The dwelling was dismantled; but we could see a white man had lived there not very long ago. There remained a rude table -- a plank on two posts; a heap of rubbish reposed in a dark corner, and by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness; but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was, AN INQUIRY INTO SOME POINTS OF SEAMANSHIP, by a man Towser, Towson -- some such name -- master in his Majesty's Navy. The matter looked dreary reading enough, with illustrative diagrams and repulsive tables of figures, and the copy was sixty years old. I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness, lest it should dissolve in my hands. Within, Towson or Towser was inquiring earnestly into the breaking strain of ships' chains and tackle, and other such matters. Not a very enthralling book; but at the first glance you could see there a singleness of intention, an honest concern for the right way of going to work, which made these humble pages, thought out so many years ago, luminous with another than a professional light. The simple old sailor, with his talk of chains and purchases, made me forget the jungle and the pilgrims in a delicious sensation of having come upon something unmistakably real. Such a book being there was wonderful enough; but still more astounding were the notes pencilled in the margin, and plainly referring to the text. I couldn't believe my eyes! They were in cipher! Yes, it looked like cipher. Fancy a man lugging with him a book of that description into this nowhere and studying it -- and making notes -- in cipher at that! It was an extravagant mystery.

""I had been dimly aware for some time of a worrying noise, and when I lifted my eyes I saw the wood-pile was gone, and the manager, aided by all the pilgrims, was shouting at me from the riverside. I slipped the book into my pocket. I assure you to leave off reading was like tearing myself away from the shelter of an old and solid friendship.

""I started the lame engine ahead. 'It must be this miserable trader-this intruder,' exclaimed the manager, looking back malevolently at the place we had left. 'He must be English,' I said. 'It will not save him from getting into trouble if he is not careful,' muttered the manager darkly. I observed with assumed innocence that no man was safe from trouble in this world.

""The current was more rapid now, the steamer seemed at her last gasp, the stern-wheel flopped languidly, and I caught myself listening on tiptoe for the next beat of the boat, for in sober truth I expected the wretched thing to give up every moment. It was like watching the last flickers of a life. But still we crawled. Sometimes I would pick out a tree a little way ahead to measure our progress towards Kurtz by, but I lost it invariably before we got abreast. To keep the eyes so long on one thing was too much for human patience. The manager displayed a beautiful resignation. I fretted and fumed and took to arguing with myself whether or no I would talk openly with Kurtz; but before I could come to any conclusion it occurred to me that my speech or my silence, indeed any action of mine, would be a mere futility. What did it matter what any one knew or ignored? What did it matter who was manager? One gets sometimes such a flash of insight. The essentials of this affair lay deep under the surface, beyond my reach, and beyond my power of meddling.

""Towards the evening of the second day we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz's station. I wanted to push on; but the manager looked grave, and told me the navigation up there was so dangerous that it would be advisable, the sun being very low already, to wait where we were till next morning. Moreover, he pointed out that if the warning to approach cautiously were to be followed, we must approach in daylight -- not at dusk or in the dark. This was sensible enough. Eight miles meant nearly three hours' steaming for us, and I could also see suspicious ripples at the upper end of the reach. Nevertheless, I was annoyed beyond expression at the delay, and most unreasonably, too, since one night more could not matter much after so many months. As we had plenty of wood, and caution was the word, I brought up in the middle of the stream. The reach was narrow, straight, with high sides like a railway cutting. The dusk came gliding into it long before the sun had set. The current ran smooth and swift, but a dumb immobility sat on the banks. The living trees, lashed together by the creepers and every living bush of the undergrowth, might have been changed into stone, even to the slenderest twig, to the lightest leaf. It was not sleep -- it seemed unnatural, like a state of trance. Not the faintest sound of any kind could be heard. You looked on amazed, and began to suspect yourself of being deaf -- then the night came suddenly, and struck you blind as well. About three in the morning some large fish leaped, and the loud splash made me jump as though a gun had been fired. When the sun rose there was a white fog, very warm and clammy, and more blinding than the night. It did not shift or drive; it was just there, standing all round you like something solid. At eight or nine, perhaps, it lifted as a shutter lifts. We had a glimpse of the towering multitude of trees, of the immense matted jungle, with the blazing little ball of the sun hanging over it -- all perfectly still -- and then the white shutter came down again, smoothly, as if sliding in greased grooves. I ordered the chain, which we had begun to heave in, to be paid out again. Before it stopped running with a muffled rattle, a cry, a very loud cry, as of infinite desolation, soared slowly in the opaque air. It ceased. A complaining clamour, modulated in savage discords, filled our ears. The sheer unexpectedness of it made my hair stir under my cap. I don't know how it struck the others: to me it seemed as though the mist itself had screamed, so suddenly, and apparently from all sides at once, did this tumultuous and mournful uproar arise. It culminated in a hurried outbreak of almost intolerably excessive shrieking, which stopped short, leaving us stiffened in a variety of silly attitudes, and obstinately listening to the nearly as appalling and excessive silence. 'Good God! What is the meaning -- ' stammered at my elbow one of the pilgrims -- a little fat man, with sandy hair and red whiskers, who wore sidespring boots, and pink pyjamas tucked into his socks. Two others remained open-mouthed a while minute, then dashed into the little cabin, to rush out incontinently and stand darting scared glances, with Winchesters at 'ready' in their hands. What we could see was just the steamer we were on, her outlines blurred as though she had been on the point of dissolving, and a misty strip of water, perhaps two feet broad, around her -- and that was all. The rest of the world was nowhere, as far as our eyes and ears were concerned. Just nowhere. Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind.

""I went forward, and ordered the chain to be hauled in short, so as to be ready to trip the anchor and move the steamboat at once if necessary. 'Will they attack?' whispered an awed voice. 'We will be all butchered in this fog,' murmured another. The faces twitched with the strain, the hands trembled slightly, the eyes forgot to wink. It was very curious to see the contrast of expressions of the white men and of the black fellows of our crew, who were as much strangers to that part of the river as we, though their homes were only eight hundred miles away. The whites, of course greatly discomposed, had besides a curious look of being painfully shocked by such an outrageous row. The others had an alert, naturally interested expression; but their faces were essentially quiet, even those of the one or two who grinned as they hauled at the chain. Several exchanged short, grunting phrases, which seemed to settle the matter to their satisfaction. Their headman, a young, broad-chested black, severely draped in dark-blue fringed cloths, with fierce nostrils and his hair all done up artfully in oily ringlets, stood near me. 'Aha!' I said, just for good fellowship's sake. 'Catch 'im,' he snapped, with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth -- 'catch 'im. Give 'im to us.' 'To you, eh?' I asked; 'what would you do with them?' 'Eat 'im!' he said curtly, and, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked out into the fog in a dignified and profoundly pensive attitude. I would no doubt have been properly horrified, had it not occurred to me that he and his chaps must be very hungry: that they must have been growing increasingly hungry for at least this month past. They had been engaged for six months (I don't think a single one of them had any clear idea of time, as we at the end of countless ages have. They still belonged to the beginnings of time -- had no inherited experience to teach them as it were), and of course, as long as there was a piece of paper written over in accordance with some farcical law or other made down the river, it didn't enter anybody's head to trouble how they would live. Certainly they had brought with them some rotten hippo-meat, which couldn't have lasted very long, anyway, even if the pilgrims hadn't, in the midst of a shocking hullabaloo, thrown a considerable quantity of it over-board. It looked like a high-handed proceeding; but it was really a case of legitimate self-defence. You can't breathe dead hippo waking, sleeping, and eating, and at the same time keep your precarious grip on existence. Besides that, they had given them every week three pieces of brass wire, each about nine inches long; and the theory was they were to buy their provisions with that currency in riverside villages. You can see how that worked. There were either no villages, or the people were hostile, or the director, who like the rest of us fed out of tins, with an occasional old he-goat thrown in, didn't want to stop the steamer for some more or less recondite reason. So, unless they swallowed the wire itself, or made loops of it to snare the fishes with, I don't see what good their extravagant salary could be to them. I must say it was paid with a regularity worthy of a large and honourable trading company. For the rest, the only thing to eat -- though it didn't look eatable in the least -- I saw in their possession was a few lumps of some stuff like half-cooked dough, of a dirty lavender colour, they kept wrapped in leaves, and now and then swallowed a piece of, but so small that it seemed done more for the looks of the thing than for any serious purpose of sustenance. Why in the name of all the gnawing devils of hunger they didn't go for us -- they were thirty to five -- and have a good tuck-in for once, amazes me now when I think of it. They were big powerful men, with not much capacity to weigh the consequences, with courage, with strength, even yet, though their skins were no longer glossy and their muscles no longer hard. And I saw that something restraining, one of those human secrets that baffle probability, had come into play there. I looked at them with a swift quickening of interest -- not because it occurred to me I might be eaten by them before very long, though I own to you that just then I perceived -- in a new light, as it were -- how unwholesome the pilgrims looked, and I hoped, yes, I positively hoped, that my aspect was not so -- what shall I say? -- so -- unappetizing: a touch of fantastic vanity which fitted well with the dream-sensation that pervaded all my days at that time. Perhaps I had a little fever, too. One can't live with one's finger everlastingly on one's pulse. I had often 'a little fever,' or a little touch of other things -- the playful paw-strokes of the wilderness, the preliminary trifling before the more serious onslaught which came in due course. Yes; I looked at them as you would on any human being, with a curiosity of their impulses, motives, capacities, weaknesses, when brought to the test of an inexorable physical necessity. Restraint! What possible restraint? Was it superstition, disgust, patience, fear -- or some kind of primitive honour? No fear can stand up to hunger, no patience can wear it out, disgust simply does not exist where hunger is; and as to superstition, beliefs, and what you may call principles, they are less than chaff in a breeze. Don't you know the devilry of lingering starvation, its exasperating torment, its black thoughts, its sombre and brooding ferocity? Well, I do. It takes a man all his inborn strength to fight hunger properly. It's really easier to face bereavement, dishonour, and the perdition of one's soul -- than this kind of prolonged hunger. Sad, but true. And these chaps, too, had no earthly reason for any kind of scruple. Restraint! I would just as soon have expected restraint from a hyena prowling amongst the corpses of a battlefield. But there was the fact facing me -- the fact dazzling, to be seen, like the foam on the depths of the sea, like a ripple on an unfathomable enigma, a mystery greater -- when I thought of it -- than the curious, inexplicable note of desperate grief in this savage clamour that had swept by us on the river-bank, behind the blind whiteness of the fog.

""Two pilgrims were quarrelling in hurried whispers as to which bank. 'Left.' ""no, no; how can you? Right, right, of course.' 'It is very serious,' said the manager's voice behind me; 'I would be desolated if anything should happen to Mr. Kurtz before we came up.' I looked at him, and had not the slightest doubt he was sincere. He was just the kind of man who would wish to preserve appearances. That was his restraint. But when he muttered something about going on at once, I did not even take the trouble to answer him. I knew, and he knew, that it was impossible. Were we to let go our hold of the bottom, we would be absolutely in the air -- in space. We wouldn't be able to tell where we were going to -- whether up or down stream, or across -- till we fetched against one bank or the other -- and then we wouldn't know at first which it was. Of course I made no move. I had no mind for a smash-up. You couldn't imagine a more deadly place for a shipwreck. Whether we drowned at once or not, we were sure to perish speedily in one way or another. 'I authorize you to take all the risks,' he said, after a short silence. 'I refuse to take any,' I said shortly; which was just the answer he expected, though its tone might have surprised him. 'Well, I must defer to your judgment. You are captain,' he said with marked civility. I turned my shoulder to him in sign of my appreciation, and looked into the fog. How long would it last? It was the most hopeless lookout. The approach to this Kurtz grubbing for ivory in the wretched bush was beset by as many dangers as though he had been an enchanted princess sleeping in a fabulous castle. 'Will they attack, do you think?' asked the manager, in a confidential tone.

""I did not think they would attack, for several obvious reasons. The thick fog was one. If they left the bank in their canoes they would get lost in it, as we would be if we attempted to move. Still, I had also judged the jungle of both banks quite impenetrable -- and yet eyes were in it, eyes that had seen us. The riverside bushes were certainly very thick; but the undergrowth behind was evidently penetrable. However, during the short lift I had seen no canoes anywhere in the reach -- certainly not abreast of the steamer. But what made the idea of attack inconceivable to me was the nature of the noise -- of the cries we had heard. They had not the fierce character boding immediate hostile intention. Unexpected, wild, and violent as they had been, they had given me an irresistible impression of sorrow. The glimpse of the steamboat had for some reason filled those savages with unrestrained grief. The danger, if any, I expounded, was from our proximity to a great human passion let loose. Even extreme grief may ultimately vent itself in violence -- but more generally takes the form of apathy.

""You should have seen the pilgrims stare! They had no heart to grin, or even to revile me: but I believe they thought me gone mad -- with fright, maybe. I delivered a regular lecture. My dear boys, it was no good bothering. Keep a lookout? Well, you may guess I watched the fog for the signs of lifting as a cat watches a mouse; but for anything else our eyes were of no more use to us than if we had been buried miles deep in a heap of cotton-wool It felt like it, too -- choking, warm, stifling. Besides, all I said, though it sounded extravagant, was absolutely true to fact. What we afterwards alluded to as an attack was really an attempt at repulse. The action was very far from being aggressive -- it was not even defensive, in the usual sense: it was undertaken under the stress of desperation, and in its essence was purely protective.

""It developed itself, I should say, two hours after the fog lifted, and its commencement was at a spot, roughly speaking, about a mile and a half below Kurtz's station. We had just floundered and flopped round a bend, when I saw an islet, a mere grassy hummock of bright green, in the middle of the stream. It was the only thing of the kind; but as we opened the reach more, I perceived it was the head of a long sand-bank, or rather of a chain of shallow patches stretching down the middle of the river. They were discoloured, just awash, and the whole lot was seen just under the water, exactly as a man's backbone is seen running down the middle of his back under the skin. Now, as far as I did see, I could go to the right or to the left of this. I didn't know either channel, of course. The banks looked pretty well alike, the depth appeared the same; but as I had been informed the station was on the west side, I naturally headed for the western passage.

""No sooner had we fairly entered it than I became aware it was much narrower than I had supposed. To the left of us there was the long uninterrupted shoal, and to the right a high, steep bank heavily overgrown with bushes. Above the bush the trees stood in serried ranks. The twigs overhung the current thickly, and from distance to distance a large limb of some tree projected rigidly over the stream. It was then well on in the afternoon, the face of the forest was gloomy, and a broad strip of shadow had already fallen on the water. In this shadow we steamed up -- very slowly, as you may imagine. I sheered her well inshore -- the water being deepest near the bank, as the sounding-pole informed me.

""One of my hungry and forbearing friends was sounding in the bows just below me. This steamboat was exactly like a decked scow. On the deck, there were two little teakwood houses, with doors and windows. The boiler was in the fore-end, and the machinery right astern over the whole there was a light roof, supported on stanchions. The funnel projected through that roof, and in front of the funnel a small cabin built of light planks served for a pilot-house. It contained a couch, two camp-stools, a loaded Martini-Henry leaning in one corner, a tiny table, and the steering-wheel. It had a wide door in front and a broad shutter at each side. All these were always thrown open, of course. I spent my days perched up there on the extreme fore-end of that roof, before the door. At night I slept, or tried to, on the couch. An athletic black belonging to some coast tribe and educated by my poor predecessor, was the helmsman. He sported a pair of brass earrings, wore a blue cloth wrapper from the waist to the ankles, and thought all the world of himself. He was the most unstable kind of fool I had ever seen. He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by; but if he lost sight of you, he became instantly the prey of an abject funk, and would let that cripple of a steamboat get the upper hand of him in a minute.

""I was looking down at the sounding-pole, and feeling much annoyed to see at each try a little more of it stick out of that river, when I saw my poleman give up on the business suddenly, and stretch himself flat on the deck, without even taking the trouble to haul his pole in. He kept hold on it though, and it trailed in the water. At the same time the fireman, whom I could also see below me, sat down abruptly before his furnace and ducked his head. I was amazed. Then I had to look at the river mighty quick, because there was a snag in the fairway. Sticks, little sticks, were flying about -- thick: they were whizzing before my nose, dropping below me, striking behind me against my pilot-house. All this time the river, the shore, the woods, were very quiet -- perfectly quiet. I could only hear the heavy splashing thump of the stern-wheel and the patter of these things. We cleared the snag clumsily. Arrows, by Jove! We were being shot at! I stepped in quickly to close the shutter on the land-side. That fool-helmsman, his hands on the spokes, was lifting his knees high, stamping his feet, champing his mouth, like a reined-in horse. Confound him! And we were staggering within ten feet of the bank. I had to lean right out to swing the heavy shutter, and I saw a face amongst the leaves on the level with my own, looking at me very fierce and steady; and then suddenly, as though a veil had been removed from my eyes, I made out, deep in the tangled gloom, naked breasts, arms, legs, glaring eyes -- the bush was swarming with human limbs in movement, glistening. of bronze colour. The twigs shook, swayed, and rustled, the arrows flew out of them, and then the shutter came to. 'Steer her straight,' I said to the helmsman. He held his head rigid, face forward; but his eyes rolled, he kept on lifting and setting down his feet gently, his mouth foamed a little. 'Keep quiet!' I said in a fury. I might just as well have ordered a tree not to sway in the wind. I darted out. Below me there was a great scuffle of feet on the iron deck; confused exclamations; a voice screamed, 'Can you turn back?' I caught sight of a V-shaped ripple on the water ahead. What? Another snag! A fusillade burst out under my feet. The pilgrims had opened with their Winchesters, and were simply squirting lead into that bush. A deuce of a lot of smoke came up and drove slowly forward. I swore at it. Now I couldn't see the ripple or the snag either. I stood in the doorway, peering, and the arrows came in swarms. They might have been poisoned, but they looked as though they wouldn't kill a cat. The bush began to howl. Our wood-cutters raised a warlike whoop; the report of a rifle just at my back deafened me. I glanced over my shoulder, and the pilot-house was yet full of noise and smoke when I made a dash at the wheel. The fool-nigger had dropped everything, to throw the shutter open and let off that Martini-Henry. He stood before the wide opening, glaring, and I yelled at him to come back, while I straightened the sudden twist out of that steamboat. There was no room to turn even if I had wanted to, the snag was somewhere very near ahead in that confounded smoke, there was no time to lose, so I just crowded her into the bank -- right into the bank, where I knew the water was deep.

""We tore slowly along the overhanging bushes in a whirl of broken twigs and flying leaves. The fusillade below stopped short, as I had foreseen it would when the squirts got empty. I threw my head back to a glinting whizz that traversed the pilot-house, in at one shutter-hole and out at the other. Looking past that mad helmsman, who was shaking the empty rifle and yelling at the shore, I saw vague forms of men running bent double, leaping, gliding, distinct, incomplete, evanescent. Something big appeared in the air before the shutter, the rifle went overboard, and the man stepped back swiftly, looked at me over his shoulder in an extraordinary, profound, familiar manner, and fell upon my feet. The side of his head hit the wheel twice, and the end of what appeared a long cane clattered round and knocked over a little camp-stool. It looked as though after wrenching that thing from somebody ashore he had lost his balance in the effort. The thin smoke had blown away, we were clear of the snag, and looking ahead I could see that in another hundred yards or so I would be free to sheer off, away from the bank; but my feet felt so very warm and wet that I had to look down. The man had rolled on his back and stared straight up at me; both his hands clutched that cane. It was the shaft of a spear that, either thrown or lunged through the opening, had caught him in the side, just below the ribs; the blade had gone in out of sight, after making a frightful gash; my shoes were full; a pool of blood lay very still, gleaming dark-red under the wheel; his eyes shone with an amazing lustre. The fusillade burst out again. He looked at me anxiously, gripping the spear like something precious, with an air of being afraid I would try to take it away from him. I had to make an effort to free my eyes from his gaze and attend to the steering. With one hand I felt above my head for the line of the steam whistle, and jerked out screech after screech hurriedly. The tumult of angry and warlike yells was checked instantly, and then from the depths of the woods went out such a tremulous and prolonged wail of mournful fear and utter despair as may be imagined to follow the flight of the last hope from the earth. There was a great commotion in the bush; the shower of arrows stopped, a few dropping shots rang out sharply -- then silence, in which the languid beat of the stern-wheel came plainly to my ears. I put the helm hard a-starboard at the moment when the pilgrim in pink pyjamas, very hot and agitated, appeared in the doorway. 'The manager sends me -- ' he began in an official tone, and stopped short. 'Good God!' he said, glaring at the wounded man

""We two whites stood over him, and his lustrous and inquiring glance enveloped us both. I declare it looked as though he would presently put to us some questions in an understandable language; but he died without uttering a sound, without moving a limb, without twitching a muscle. Only in the very last moment, as though in response to some sign we could not see, to some whisper we could not hear, he frowned heavily, and that frown gave to his black death-mask an inconceivably sombre, brooding, and menacing expression. The lustre of inquiring glance faded swiftly into vacant glassiness. 'Can you steer?' I asked the agent eagerly. He looked very dubious; but I made a grab at his arm, and he understood at once I meant him to steer whether or no. To tell you the truth, I was morbidly anxious to change my shoes and socks. 'He is dead,' murmured the fellow, immensely impressed. 'No doubt about it,' said I, tugging like mad at the shoe-laces. 'And by the way, I suppose Mr. Kurtz is dead as well by this time.'

""For the moment that was the dominant thought. There was a sense of extreme disappointment, as though I had found out I had been striving after something altogether without a substance. I couldn't have been more disgusted if I had travelled all this way for the sole purpose of talking with Mr. Kurtz. Talking with . . . I flung one shoe overboard, and became aware that that was exactly what I had been looking forward to -- a talk with Kurtz. I made the strange discovery that I had never imagined him as doing, you know, but as discoursing. I didn't say to myself, 'Now I will never see him,' or 'Now I will never shake him by the hand,' but, 'Now I will never hear him.' The man presented himself as a voice. Not of course that I did not connect him with some sort of action. Hadn't I been told in all the tones of jealousy and admiration that he had collected, bartered, swindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together? That was not the point. The point was in his being a gifted creature, and that of all his gifts the one that stood out preeminently, that carried with it a sense of real presence, was his ability to talk, his words -- the gift of expression, the bewildering, the illuminating, the most exalted and the most contemptible, the pulsating stream of light, or the deceitful flow from the heart of an impenetrable darkness.

""The other shoe went flying unto the devil-god of that river. I thought, 'By Jove! it's all over. We are too late; he has vanished -- the gift has vanished, by means of some spear, arrow, or club. I will never hear that chap speak after all' -- and my sorrow had a startling extravagance of emotion, even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush. I couldn't have felt more of lonely desolation somehow, had I been robbed of a belief or had missed my destiny in life. . . . Why do you sigh in this beastly way, somebody? Absurd? Well, absurd. Good Lord! mustn't a man ever -- Here, give me some tobacco.""

There was a pause of profound stillness, then a match flared, and Marlow's lean face appeared, worn, hollow, with downward folds and dropped eyelids, with an aspect of concentrated attention; and as he took vigorous draws at his pipe, it seemed to retreat and advance out of the night in the regular flicker of tiny flame. The match went out.

""Absurd!"" he cried. ""This is the worst of trying to tell. . . . Here you all are, each moored with two good addresses, like a hulk with two anchors, a butcher round one corner, a policeman round another, excellent appetites, and temperature normal -- you hear -- normal from year's end to year's end. And you say, Absurd! Absurd be -- exploded! Absurd! My dear boys, what can you expect from a man who out of sheer nervousness had just flung overboard a pair of new shoes! Now I think of it, it is amazing I did not shed tears. I am, upon the whole, proud of my fortitude. I was cut to the quick at the idea of having lost the inestimable privilege of listening to the gifted Kurtz. Of course I was wrong. The privilege was waiting for me. Oh, yes, I heard more than enough. And I was right, too. A voice. He was very little more than a voice. And I heard -- him -- it -- this voice -- other voices -- all of them were so little more than voices -- and the memory of that time itself lingers around me, impalpable, like a dying vibration of one immense jabber, silly, atrocious, sordid, savage, or simply mean, without any kind of sense. Voices, voices -- even the girl herself -- now -- ""

He was silent for a long time

""I laid the ghost of his gifts at last with a lie,"" he began, suddenly. ""Girl! What? Did I mention a girl? Oh, she is out of it -- completely. They -- the women, I mean -- are out of it -- should be out of it. We must help them to stay in that beautiful world of their own, lest ours gets worse. Oh, she had to be out of it. You should have heard the disinterred body of Mr. Kurtz saying, 'My Intended.' You would have perceived directly then how completely she was out of it. And the lofty frontal bone of Mr. Kurtz! They say the hair goes on growing sometimes, but this -- ah -- specimen, was impressively bald. The wilderness had patted him on the head, and, behold, it was like a ball -- an ivory ball; it had caressed him, and -- lo! -- he had withered; it had taken him, loved him, embraced him, got into his veins, consumed his flesh, and sealed his soul to its own by the inconceivable ceremonies of some devilish initiation. He was its spoiled and pampered favourite. Ivory? I should think so. Heaps of it, stacks of it. The old mud shanty was bursting with it. You would think there was not a single tusk left either above or below the ground in the whole country. 'Mostly fossil,' the manager had remarked, disparagingly. It was no more fossil than I am; but they call it fossil when it is dug up. It appears these niggers do bury the tusks sometimes -- but evidently they couldn't bury this parcel deep enough to save the gifted Mr. Kurtz from his fate. We filled the steamboat with it, and had to pile a lot on the deck. Thus he could see and enjoy as long as he could see, because the appreciation of this favour had remained with him to the last. You should have heard him say, 'My ivory.' Oh, yes, I heard him. 'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my -- ' everything belonged to him. It made me hold my breath in expectation of hearing the wilderness burst into a prodigious peal of laughter that would shake the fixed stars in their places. Everything belonged to him -- but that was a trifle. The thing was to know what he belonged to, how many powers of darkness claimed him for their own. That was the reflection that made you creepy all over. It was impossible -- it was not good for one either -- trying to imagine. He had taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land -- I mean literally. You can't understand. How could you? -- with solid pavement under your feet, surrounded by kind neighbours ready to cheer you or to fall on you, stepping delicately between the butcher and the policeman, in the holy terror of scandal and gallows and lunatic asylums -- how can you imagine what particular region of the first ages a man's untrammelled feet may take him into by the way of solitude -- utter solitude without a policeman -- by the way of silence -- utter silence, where no warning voice of a kind neighbour can be heard whispering of public opinion? These little things make all the great difference. When they are gone you must fall back upon your own innate strength, upon your own capacity for faithfulness. Of course you may be too much of a fool to go wrong -- too dull even to know you are being assaulted by the powers of darkness. I take it, no fool ever made a bargain for his soul with the devil; the fool is too much of a fool, or the devil too much of a devil -- I don't know which. Or you may be such a thunderingly exalted creature as to be altogether deaf and blind to anything but heavenly sights and sounds. Then the earth for you is only a standing place -- and whether to be like this is your loss or your gain I won't pretend to say. But most of us are neither one nor the other. The earth for us is a place to live in, where we must put up with sights, with sounds, with smells, too, by Jove! -- breathe dead hippo, so to speak, and not be contaminated. And there, don't you see? Your strength comes in, the faith in your ability for the digging of unostentatious holes to bury the stuff in -- your power of devotion, not to yourself, but to an obscure, back-breaking business. And that's difficult enough. Mind, I am not trying to excuse or even explain -- I am trying to account to myself for -- for -- Mr. Kurtz -- for the shade of Mr. Kurtz. This initiated wraith from the back of Nowhere honoured me with its amazing confidence before it vanished altogether. This was because it could speak English to me. The original Kurtz had been educated partly in England, and -- as he was good enough to say himself -- his sympathies were in the right place. His mother was half-English, his father was half-French. All Europe contributed to the making of Kurtz; and by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had intrusted him with the making of a report, for its future guidance. And he had written it, too. I've seen it. I've read it. It was eloquent, vibrating with eloquence, but too high-strung, I think. Seventeen pages of close writing he had found time for! But this must have been before his -- let us say -- nerves, went wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with unspeakable rites, which -- as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard at various times -- were offered up to him -- do you understand? -- to Mr. Kurtz himself. But it was a beautiful piece of writing. The opening paragraph, however, in the light of later information, strikes me now as ominous. He began with the argument that we whites, from the point of development we had arrived at, 'must necessarily appear to them [savages] in the nature of supernatural beings -- we approach them with the might of a deity,' and so on, and so on. 'By the simple exercise of our will we can exert a power for good practically unbounded,' etc., etc. From that point he soared and took me with him. The peroration was magnificent, though difficult to remember, you know. It gave me the notion of an exotic Immensity ruled by an august Benevolence. It made me tingle with enthusiasm. This was the unbounded power of eloquence -- of words -- of burning noble words. There were no practical hints to interrupt the magic current of phrases, unless a kind of note at the foot of the last page, scrawled evidently much later, in an unsteady hand, may be regarded as the exposition of a method. It was very simple, and at the end of that moving appeal to every altruistic sentiment it blazed at you, luminous and terrifying, like a flash of lightning in a serene sky: 'Exterminate all the brutes!' The curious part was that he had apparently forgotten all about that valuable postscriptum, because, later on, when he in a sense came to himself, he repeatedly entreated me to take good care of 'my pamphlet' (he called it), as it was sure to have in the future a good influence upon his career. I had full information about all these things, and, besides, as it turned out, I was to have the care of his memory. I've done enough for it to give me the indisputable right to lay it, if I choose, for an everlasting rest in the dust-bin of progress, amongst all the sweepings and, figuratively speaking, all the dead cats of civilization. But then, you see, I can't choose. He won't be forgotten. Whatever he was, he was not common. He had the power to charm or frighten rudimentary souls into an aggravated witch-dance in his honour; he could also fill the small souls of the pilgrims with bitter misgivings: he had one devoted friend at least, and he had conquered one soul in the world that was neither rudimentary nor tainted with self-seeking. No; I can't forget him, though I am not prepared to affirm the fellow was exactly worth the life we lost in getting to him. I missed my late helmsman awfully -- I missed him even while his body was still lying in the pilot-house. Perhaps you will think it passing strange this regret for a savage who was no more account than a grain of sand in a black Sahara. Well, don't you see, he had done something, he had steered; for months I had him at my back -- a help -- an instrument. It was a kind of partnership. He steered for me -- I had to look after him, I worried about his deficiencies, and thus a subtle bond had been created, of which I only became aware when it was suddenly broken. And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory -- like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment.

""Poor fool! If he had only left that shutter alone. He had no restraint, no restraint -- just like Kurtz -- a tree swayed by the wind. As soon as I had put on a dry pair of slippers, I dragged him out, after first jerking the spear out of his side, which operation I confess I performed with my eyes shut tight. His heels leaped together over the little doorstep; his shoulders were pressed to my breast; I hugged him from behind desperately. Oh! he was heavy, heavy; heavier than any man on earth, I should imagine. Then without more ado I tipped him overboard. The current snatched him as though he had been a wisp of grass, and I saw the body roll over twice before I lost sight of it for ever. All the pilgrims and the manager were then congregated on the awning-deck about the pilot-house, chattering at each other like a flock of excited magpies, and there was a scandalized murmur at my heartless promptitude. What they wanted to keep that body hanging about for I can't guess. Embalm it, maybe. But I had also heard another, and a very ominous, murmur on the deck below. My friends the wood-cutters were likewise scandalized, and with a better show of reason -- though I admit that the reason itself was quite inadmissible. Oh, quite! I had made up my mind that if my late helmsman was to be eaten, the fishes alone should have him. He had been a very second-rate helmsman while alive, but now he was dead he might have become a first-class temptation, and possibly cause some startling trouble. Besides, I was anxious to take the wheel, the man in pink pyjamas showing himself a hopeless duffer at the business.

""This I did directly the simple funeral was over. We were going half-speed, keeping right in the middle of the stream, and I listened to the talk about me. They had given up Kurtz, they had given up the station; Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt -- and so on -- and so on. The red-haired pilgrim was beside himself with the thought that at least this poor Kurtz had been properly avenged. 'Say! We must have made a glorious slaughter of them in the bush. Eh? What do you think? Say?' He positively danced, the bloodthirsty little gingery beggar. And he had nearly fainted when he saw the wounded man! I could not help saying, 'You made a glorious lot of smoke, anyhow.' I had seen, from the way the tops of the bushes rustled and flew, that almost all the shots had gone too high. You can't hit anything unless you take aim and fire from the shoulder; but these chaps fired from the hip with their eyes shut. The retreat, I maintained -- and I was right -- was caused by the screeching of the steam whistle. Upon this they forgot Kurtz, and began to howl at me with indignant protests.

""The manager stood by the wheel murmuring confidentially about the necessity of getting well away down the river before dark at all events, when I saw in the distance a clearing on the riverside and the outlines of some sort of building. 'What's this?' I asked. He clapped his hands in wonder. 'The station!' he cried. I edged in at once, still going half-speed.

""Through my glasses I saw the slope of a hill interspersed with rare trees and perfectly free from under-growth. A long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a background. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; but there had been one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining the edge of the forest above and below, I was almost certain I could see movements -- human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land. 'We have been attacked,' screamed the manager. 'I know -- I know. It's all right,' yelled back the other, as cheerful as you please. 'Come along. It's all right. I am glad.'

""His aspect reminded me of something I had seen -- something funny I had seen somewhere. As I manoeuvred to get alongside, I was asking myself, 'What does this fellow look like?' Suddenly I got it. He looked like a harlequin. His clothes had been made of some stuff that was brown holland probably, but it was covered with patches all over, with bright patches, blue, red, and yellow -- patches on the back, patches on the front, patches on elbows, on knees; coloured binding around his jacket, scarlet edging at the bottom of his trousers; and the sun-shine made him look extremely gay and wonderfully neat withal, because you could see how beautifully all this patching had been done. A beardless, boyish face, very fair, no features to speak of, nose peeling, little blue eyes, smiles and frowns chasing each other over that open countenance like sunshine and shadow on a wind-swept plain. 'Look out, captain!' he cried; 'there's a snag lodged in here last night.' What! Another snag? I confess I swore shamefully. I had nearly holed my cripple, to finish off that charming trip. The harlequin on the bank turned his little pug-nose up to me. 'You English?' he asked, all smiles. 'Are you?' I shouted from the wheel. The smiles vanished, and he shook his head as if sorry for my disappointment. Then he brightened up. 'Never mind!' he cried encouragingly. 'Are we in time?' I asked. 'He is up there,' he replied, with a toss of the head up the hill, and becoming gloomy all of a sudden. His face was like the autumn sky, overcast one moment and bright the next.

""When the manager, escorted by the pilgrims, all of them armed to the teeth, had gone to the house this chap came on board. 'I say, I don't like this. These natives are in the bush,' I said. He assured me earnestly it was all right. 'They are simple people,' he added; 'well, I am glad you came. It took me all my time to keep them off.' 'But you said it was all right,' I cried. 'Oh, they meant no harm,' he said; and as I stared he corrected himself, 'Not exactly.' Then vivaciously, 'My faith, your pilot-house wants a clean-up!' In the next breath he advised me to keep enough steam on the boiler to blow the whistle in case of any trouble. 'One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles. They are simple people,' he repeated. He rattled away at such a rate he quite overwhelmed me. He seemed to be trying to make up for lots of silence, and actually hinted, laughing, that such was the case. 'Don't you talk with Mr. Kurtz?' I said. 'You don't talk with that man -- you listen to him,' he exclaimed with severe exaltation. 'But now -- ' He waved his arm, and in the twinkling of an eye was in the utter-most depths of despondency. In a moment he came up again with a jump, possessed himself of both my hands, shook them continuously, while he gabbled: 'Brother sailor . . . honour . . . pleasure . . . delight . . . introduce myself . . . Russian . . . son of an arch-priest . . . Government of Tambov . . . What? Tobacco! English tobacco; the excellent English tobacco! Now, that's brotherly. Smoke? Where's a sailor that does not smoke?""

""The pipe soothed him, and gradually I made out he had run away from school, had gone to sea in a Russian ship; ran away again; served some time in English ships; was now reconciled with the arch-priest. He made a point of that. 'But when one is young one must see things gather experience, ideas; enlarge the mind.' 'Here!' I interrupted. 'You can never tell! Here I met Mr. Kurtz,' he said, youthfully solemn and reproachful. I held my tongue after that. It appears he had persuaded a Dutch trading-house on the coast to fit him out with stores and goods, and had started for the interior with a light heart and no more idea of what would happen to him than a baby. He had been wandering about that river for nearly two years alone, cut off from everybody and everything. 'I am not so young as I look. I am twenty-five,' he said. 'At first old Van Shuyten would tell me to go to the devil,' he narrated with keen enjoyment; 'but I stuck to him, and talked and talked, till at last he got afraid I would talk the hind-leg off his favourite dog, so he gave me some cheap things and a few guns, and told me he hoped he would never see my face again. Good old Dutchman, Van Shuyten. I've sent him one small lot of ivory a year ago, so that he can't call me a little thief when I get back. I hope he got it. And for the rest I don't care. I had some wood stacked for you. That was my old house. Did you see?'

""I gave him Towson's book. He made as though he would kiss me, but restrained himself. 'The only book I had left, and I thought I had lost it,' he said, looking at it ecstatically. 'So many accidents happen to a man going about alone, you know. Canoes get upset sometimes -- and sometimes you've got to clear out so quick when the people get angry.' He thumbed the pages. 'You made notes in Russian?' I asked. He nodded. 'I thought they were written in cipher,' I said. He laughed, then became serious. 'I had lots of trouble to keep these people off,' he said. 'Did they want to kill you?' I asked. 'Oh, no!' he cried, and checked himself. 'Why did they attack us?' I pursued. He hesitated, then said shamefacedly, 'They don't want him to go.' 'Don't they?' I said curiously. He nodded a nod full of mystery and wisdom. 'I tell you,' he cried, 'this man has enlarged my mind.' He opened his arms wide, staring at me with his little blue eyes that were perfectly round."".",Joseph Conrad,1976,"[72, 76, 84, 86]",4

Walls come down and the guards come up

Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?

Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends

I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up

But I wanna spend this evening breathing in ya fragrance
Too long since I've seen my better half
Sometimes you gotta let go, close your eyes and let it crash
Road to life is the only one I have to give
Lonely isn't a strong enough adjective
To describe all those nights that I've tried to grip tight
I lack the necessary tools to help me get right
So take your place as the temporary savior
While I'm looking at your face like I'll be tested on it later
I bet you like to fuck, but you love to argue
Poke a hole into my chest and pull my heart through
Up to my room for cigarettes and cartoons
Or we could sit right here and try to guard these barstools
I'll take you anyway that I can have you
Bring along your ethics and your issues and your taboos
It's not the standard ""Free Bird' situation
But you're talking to these pieces of a man whose trying to make it
Through the puzzles, travels, struggles, battles
The body pillow pimp trying to snuggle with my shadow
We could stay proper keep the clothes on, no pressure
Just hold me and pretend like you've known me forever
Won't ya..

[Hook:]
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right
Be my woman tonight
Just ain't feelin' right

[Murs]
Damn, why'd she have to leave right after the show
All that eye contact made from the front row
Them vibes I was getting man I thought it was a go
Could used that type of company, you just don't know
I been on the road for like six months straight
Only two days off between all of them dates
The hardest working man in the underground game
Most times I'm too tired to hang around and spit game
Most nights are the same, shows is just like work
Leave the stage, stand around, selling merchs and shirts
Then I peeked her pink skirt out the corner of my eye
By the exit posted up like a tack, looking fly
I tried to play it cool, but I coudn't pretend
So I approached hella anxious with a silly ass grin
She said she dropped off her friends, so we could be alone
Gave her undivided attention, turned off her phone
Took me out for pancakes, paid for the dinner
Then took me to my room, let me watch sports center
And then we made out, and then we made love
And then I passed out while I got a backrub
But in the middle of the night I reached for a second helpin'
Got a hand full of sheets, I was all by myself an'
Before you could say: 'Goddamn that sucks'
JayBird called: ""cats, van, bags” … FUCK!

567,Every Beat Of My Heart,"Through these misty eyes I see lonely skies
Lonely road to Babylon
Where's my family
And my country
Heaven knows where I belong

Pack my bags tonight
Here's one Jacobite
Who must leave or surely die
Put me on a train
In the pouring rain say farewell
But don't say goodbye

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

One more glass of wine
Just for auld lang syne
And the girl I left behind
How I miss her now In my darkest hour

And the way our arms entwine

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart
I'm lost and alone in the dark
I'm going home

And we'll drink a toast
To the blood red rose
Cheer a while the
Emerald Isle
And to the northern lights
And the swirling pipes
How they make a grown man cry

Seagull carry me, over land and sea
To my own folk, that's where I want to be
Every beat of my heart
Tears me further apart

I'm going home",Gladys Knight & the Pips,1976,"[83, 83, 87, 89]",4

Since you were here, I can't go on
I cried for you, to no avail
Now my life runs cold when the night winds wail
But I cheat the hangman, cheated him many times before
The bell that tolls the hour has turned sweet lips to sour
Yes, I cheat the hangman and even when life has flown away
I leave a kiss behind

The rain that fell upon my stone
Like tears you cry I shared alone
I walk the night, I cannot sleep
The love you spend you cannot reap

The glow of love will then shine

Only lighted windows stare at the lonely stranger there returning home",The Doobie Brothers,1976,"[60, 65, 76]",3

574,For A Dancer,"Keep a fire burning in your eye
Pay attention to the open sky
You never know what will be coming down
I don't remember losing track of you
You were always dancing in and out of view
I must have thought you'd always be around
Always keeping things real by playing the clown
Now you're nowhere to be found
I don't know what happens when people die
Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
It's like a song I can hear playing right in my ear
That I can't sing
I can't help listening
And I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round
Crying as they ease you down
'cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing
Dancing our sorrow away
(right on dancing)
No matter what fate chooses to play
(there's nothing you can do about it anyway)
Just do the steps that you've been shown
By everyone you've ever known
Until the dance becomes your very own
No matter how close to yours
Another's steps have grown
In the end there is one dance you'll do alone
Keep a fire for the human race
Let your prayers go drifting into space
You never know what will be coming down
Perhaps a better world is drawing near
And just as easily it could all disappear
Along with whatever meaning you might have found
Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
(the world keeps turning around and around)
Go on and make a joyful sound
Into a dancer you have grown
From a seed somebody else has thrown
Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
And somewhere between the time you arrive
And the time you go
May lie a reason you were alive
But you'll never know",Katey Sagal,1976,"[63, 66, 69]",3

Back in my little town
Nothing but the dead and dying

Strong enough to survive
Strong enough to be gentle

My heart is spinning like a helter-skelter
We'll get to know each other if we can

She said hey - just a little bit - hold on
When ever I try to think of what it feels like to feel it
For the frst time, and was it really such a thrill
She said look, boy - but don't you touch

That ain't much - only a school boy crush

Got to keep this secret - can't take no chance
Don't want nobody else to know
There is nothing wrong with trying to start a romance
(But) we should take it rather slow
If we play it cool - It'll be all right
Don't let the teacher see us talking
But after school we will be out of sight
Everybody gonna think we just gone walkin'

And everybody's watchin'

Now I'm looking out my window
And what do I see?
I see an army of a soldier man
Marching across the street, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, Mr. Soldier man
Tomorrow is the day you go to war
But you are fighting for another man's cause
And you don't even know him

Ooo...!
What did he say to make you so blind
To your conscience and reason?
Could it be love for your country?
Or for the gun you use in killing?

[Chorus]
So... there is fire on the mountain
And nobody seems to be on the run
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin'

[Verse 3]
Hey, Mr. Lover man
Can I get a chance to talk to you?
'Cause you are fooling with a dead man's corpse
And you don't know what you do

So you say you have a lover
And you love her like no other
So you buy her a diamond that someone has died on
Don't you think there something wrong with this?

[Verse 4]
Tell me!
Who's responsible for what we teach our children?
Is it the Internet or the stars on television?
Why? Oh why? Why? Oh, Why? Oh!

So little Lucy turns sixteen
And like the movie she's been seeing
She has a lover in her daddy
She can't tell nobody till she makes the evening news

[Chorus]
For there is fire on the mountain
And there is nobody seems to be on the run
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin', oh yes

[Bridge]
One day the river will overflow
And there'll be no where for us to go
And we will run, run
Wishing we had put out the fire, oh!!!

[Chorus]
For there is fire on the mountain, yeah, yeah
And there ain't nobody seems to be on the run
Nobody, nobody, oh!
Oh, there is fire on the mountain top
And no one is a runnin', so, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
There is fire on the mountain
(Fire in Africa, oh...!)
Nobody seems to be on the run
(Fire everywhere, everywhere in the sea, yeah!)
Fire on the mountain top
(Fire in the ocean, la-da!)
No one is a runnin'!
Fire on the mountain
Nobody seems to be on the run
Fire on the mountain",Aṣa,1976,"[77, 47]",2
586,Breakfast For Two,"An air of self delusion that no two arms could ever contain
This lady is a hypnosis poet and when she speaks her words weep like rain
She tiptoes through the side streets in the morning and wears dark sunshades at night
However she might be spending her time I don't know you'd have to ask her neighbors

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one
My dear ramona

Born in some unnatural state that no one father would claim
This daughter saving up commissions from acting but no one's ever seen her play
She fixes breakfast for two in the morning and drinks dark coffee at night
Whoever she might be going to bed with, you can read about that in her Moleskine

But she ain't ever gonna open up (no)
She ain't ever gonna open up (no)
Not to no one

587,Blue Guitar,"I once knew a man
Showed me the sleight of hand
In the blink of an eye he danced across the strings
He played a song I'd never heard
Poignant and absurd
And to this day it leaves me wondering

How I wish tommorrow I were fishin'
Boy I got a mission, to shake it rattle and roll
Oh now just use your intuition
You'll get less competition, from the clock upon the wall

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me serenade
A simple masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

Was he real or make-believe
Or someone to deceive
That time is just a folly we can't see
You only know one song
Play it right or play it wrong
'Cause the truth is always somewhere in between

You and I - we can't change the weather
And we're all in this together so let the stong wind blow
Oh now things will be much better
If you don't become a prisoner to the reason you should know

You are what you are
You dream what you dream
Play on your blue guitar for me
Play me a serenade
A lover's masquerade
Play on your blue guitar for me

(let's play it boys)

How I wish tommorrow I were fishin'
Boy Igot a mission, to shake it rattle and roll
Oh now just use your intuition
You'll get less competition, from the clock upon the wall

You are what you are
You dream what you dream

Play me serenade

Baby, baby
Baby io so volare
Izeh, Izeh

[Ritornello]
Baby io so volare
Un giorno vieni con me
Io so come curare
Tu vieni un giorno con me
Con me, con me, con me
Con me, con me, con me
Con me, con me, con me
Con me, con me
Tu vieni un giorno con me

[Strofa 1]
Viaggio levitando come un fachiro
Tu stai screditando la famiglia amico
Sguinzaglio la mia dipendenza dalla gadro
Frà 'sti pacchi in giro fan lo sbirro ladro
Fumo le fumo l'essenza
Nuvole, nuvole e nebbia
In giro ho le brugole per chi ha bisogno
Io metto a posto e lo stato mi ferma
Faccio lo stesso che non m'interessa
Posto di blocco: pezzi di merda
Piuttosto la butto dal terzo a P-Terra
Piuttosto mi butto che scappo nell'erba
E questi fan brutto ma mai come me
Lo sanno tutti, pure la tua zozza
Se faccio le zozze sul pezzo
È perchè devo sporcarti l'orecchio per forza
E tu vieni con me che ti conviene
Che vedrai un giorno con me ti diverti
Come quel tifoso all'inizio di un derby
Con me sei schifoso: una pressa
Comprendi?

Vieni un giorno con me

[Strofa 2]
Quando mi scrivi quelle cose sai che non è vero
Che mi fomenti tanto per, ma lo vorresti dietro
Son fatto per non ascoltarti, tanto che vorresti?
Tu non ti ascolti e dai pareri come se sapessi
Io che ti scopo giusto proprio perché non capisci
Che ti confondi in due secondi
Vuoi la canna e il Riesling
Dopo ti offendi che provi a colpirmi
Ma ti riprendi? Dovresti coprirti!
Fra' per la strada continuo a colpire
Sto con la bandana e non mi piace che scoppi gli scarsi
Aperitivo con gli anacardi
Dopo le scrivo se vuole beccarsi
Sta fuori al bar con il suo bacardi
Sta con gli amici, non ha voglia di fare se stessa
Poi si allontana per fare se stessa
Sopra di me, me pari una leonessa
Lascio le pare per due ore, dopo le riacchiappo
Questa va via col culo rosso: impronta dello schiaffo
Faccio ""Un, due, tre"" però al due scappo
Faccio ""Vroom Vroom Vroom"" con il booster marcio
Ti fotto bene non mi vedi più
Ti ho scopato bene, forse troppo, non ti levi più
Ti ho firmato i Levi's, dopo i leggins non li levi più
Senti il mio profumo ovunque quindi non ti lavi più

591,The Last Game Of The Season (A Blind Man In The Bleachers),"He's just the blind man in the bleachers
To the local home town fans
And he sits beneath the speakers
Way back in the stands
And he listens to the play by play
He's just waiting for one name
He wants to hear his son get in the game

But the boy's not just a hero
He's strictly second team
Tho he runs each night for touchdowns
In his father's sweetest dreams
He's gonna be a star some day
Tho you might never tell
But the blind man in the bleachers knows he will

And the last game of the season is a Friday night at home
And no one knows the reason but the blind man didn't come
And his boy looks kinda nervous
Sometimes turns around and stares
Just as tho' he sees the old man sittin' there

The local boys are tryin' but they slowly lose their will
Another player's down and now
He's carried from the field
At halftime in the locker room
The kid goes off alone
And no one sees him talkin' on the phone

The game's already started
When he gets back to the team
And half the crowd can hear his coach yell
""Where the hell you been?""
""Just gettin' ready for the second half,""
Is all he'll say
""Cause now you're gonna let me in to play.""

Without another word, he turns and runs into the game
And through the silence on the field
Loudspeakers call his name
It'll make the local papers
How the team came from behind
When they saw him playin' his heart to win

And when the game was over
The coach asked him to tell
What was it he was thinkin' of
That made him play so well

""Tonight he passed away""

A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night, the stars overhead are Christmas tree lights

595,"Soul Train ""75""","100. Migos ft. Drake ""Versace""In June, Drake randomly released 4 songs at one time: his and J. Cole’s “Jodeci Freestyle"", PARTYNEXTDOOR’s “Over Here”, “The Motion"" with Sampha, and this banger by Atlanta rap trio Migos. This was the song that put Migos on the map, allowing them to have excellent promotion for their Y.R.N. mixtape. The track is one of Rap Genius’ 30 most viewed songs, coming in with 1.8 million views.99. BIG KRIT ""REM""98. Lupe Fiasco ""Peace of paper/Cup of JAYZUS""97. Joey Badass ""#Longlivesteelo""
96. Meek Mill ""Lil Nigga Snupe""95. Logic ""Nasty""
Produced by DJ Don Cannon, this wordplay-heavy track puts Logic on display for all to see. None can ignore Def Jam’s latest signee; the double entendres are abundant and the flow hits code red. Serving as his first single of the year proved to be a successful venture, gaining tens of thousands of views on Rap Genius and creating a platform for his Young Sinatra: Welcome To Forever mixtape.
94. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA ""Ronnie Drake"" 93. Kid Cudi ft. King Chip & ASAP Rocky ""Brothers""
92. Lupe Fiasco ""Animal Pharm""91. French Montana ""Ain't Worried About Nothin'""90. Mellow High ft. Domo Genesis ""Yu"" Domo Genesis constructs a catchy hook to bounce over Left Brain’s keyboard heavy production. The Odd Future duo of Domo and Hodgy Beats lay down dope bars with their usual uncensored subject matter of drugs, bitches and wolves!
89. Mike WiLL Made It  ft. Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa, & Juicy J ""23""88. Action Bronson ""Strictly For My Jeeps""
87. Rapsody ft. Chance the Rapper ""Lonely Thoughts""86. Ab Soul ft. Mac Miller ""The End Is Near""85. DJ Khaled ft. Drake, Rick Ross, & Lil Wayne ""No New Friends""“No New Friends” was the first single off DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success album. Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""
82. Flatbush Zombies ""MRAZ""81. Wale ft. Sam Dew ""Love/Hate Thing""80. Vic Mensa ""Lovely Day""“Lovely Day” is just one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance, because it’s so upbeat and fun! Vic lays down some dope bars, with metaphors that carry across multiple lines, a reference to Lupe’s “Daydreamin’”, and a shoutout to his best friend, what’s not to love about this track?79. Meek Mill ""Levels""78. Run The Jewels ""A Christmas Fucking Miracle""
77. Lil Wayne ft. Drake & Future ""Love Me""76. Danny Brown ft. Freddie Gibbs ""The Return""75. 2 Chainz ""Used 2""This rare 2 Chainz solo joint has banging drums, an infectious hook, and a great club vibe. Produced by Mannie Fresh, the cut from B.O.A.T.S ll #METIME sees Tity Boi travel from Cali to New Orleans in the space of 2 bars, party the night away, and encourage more twerking. What isn’t there to like?74. Lil Wayne ft. 2 Chainz ""Rich As Fuck""73. Vic Mensa ft. Ab-Soul ""Holy, Holy""
72. Tech N9ne ft. Serj Tankian ""Straight Out The Gate""71. ASAP Nast ft. Method Man ""Trillmatic""70. Kid Cudi ""Immortal""In an extremely personal ”Immortal”, Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud, this track saw Cudi handle all duties, production included. The drums hit hard, the harmonizing is uplifting and the strings melt your ears. Even an Adam Sandler sample made its way into the joint!
69. Tyler, the Creator ""48""68. Lil Wayne ft. Chance The Rapper ""You Song""67. Jhene Aiko ft. Childish Gambino ""Bed Peace""
66. TI ft. B.o.B & Kendrick Lamar ""Memories Back Then""65. Mac Miller ft. Schoolboy Q ""Gees""This playful track is about nothing at all, so who better to kill it than Q and Mac? Mac lays down a characteristically hilarious hook and switches flows and voices as the bouncy beat from Chuck Inglish changes up. Q does his high-energy Q thing and blesses us with a nice ""FIGG SIDEEEEEEEE"" to wrap it all up.64. Lil B ""I Love You""63. Danny Brown ft. Purity Ring ""25 Bucks""62. Schoolboy Q ""Yay Yay""61. Wale ft. Tiara Thomas ""Bad""60. Lupe Fiasco ""SLR 2""
The fan requested “Control” response brought out Super Lupe for the second time and he was none too happy with the game. He called out multiple rappers while seamlessly changing flows and displaying classic Lupe lyricism. Oh yeah, and he made the song in just two hours!59. Mac Miller ""Objects In The Mirror""58. Earl Sweatshirt ft. Tyler, the Creator ""Whoa""57. Childish Gambino ft. Chance the Rapper ""Worst Guys""56. 2 Chainz ft. Pharrell ""Feds Watching""55. Rich Homie Quan ""Type Of Way""
One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54. Vic Mensa ""Orange Soda""53. Ace Hood ""Bugatti"" ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels ""Banana Clipper""51. YG ""My Nigga""50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)” ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler, the Creator “Answer”47. Joey Badass “'95 'Till Infinity”46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames

12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same

08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views

Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree

The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West",Rap Genius,1976,[75],1

600,I Believe In Father Christmas,"They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
But instead it just kept on raining
A veil of tears for the Virgin's Birth
I remember one Christmas morning
A winter's light and a distant choir
And the peal of a bell and that Christmas Tree smell
And their eyes full of tinsel and fire

They sold me a dream of Christmas
They sold me a Silent Night
And they told me a fairy story
'Till I believed in the Israelite
And I believed in Father Christmas
And I looked at the Sky with excited eyes
'till I woke with a yawn in the first Light of dawn
And I saw him and through his disguise

I wish you a hopeful Christmas
I wish you a brave New Year
All anguish and pain and sadness
Leave your Heart and let your road be clear
They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth
Hallelujah, Noel, be it Heaven or hell
The Christmas you get you deserve

They said there'll be snow at Christmas
They said there'll be peace on Earth",Tony Hadley,1976,[95],1
