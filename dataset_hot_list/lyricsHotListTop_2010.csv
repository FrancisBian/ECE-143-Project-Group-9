0,Firework,"[Verse 1]
Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Verse 2]
You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow
Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time, you'll know

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

[Bridge]
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
As you shoot across the sky
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Aah, aah, aah""
You're gonna leave them all in awe, awe, awe

17,That's All She Wrote,"[Hook 1: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new, I seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin'
That I’m sewin' up the game, destroyin' like they hate me for it
Eventually, see they can't beat and then with me, they join
Others sworn under oath or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they were this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on, I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Thought you niggas been known, ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezys, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check, recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind

Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me

But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate
Terrible fate, not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho, I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothin' to cry over
Never shoulda came within range of my Rover
Shoulda known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull five bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Hook 2: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know

Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with (that's it)
But don’t get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit (nope)
Yeah, life is sure a bitch (bitch), but she know I’m rich (I'm rich)
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah-ha, I’m paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me totin' anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can't get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish–sorry, bro, this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't, I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin' it
Double timing it, but I still spit triple the amount of
Insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
To catch on; while you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dawg
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg

[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King, they were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle, shawty, that's why

[Hook 3: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
But still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote",T.I.,2010,[18],1

Is this some sick pleasure
Cannot take the pressure

Forget asking why
Say goodbye to your mama
Baby dry your eyes

Baby realize how you're playing us

I wonder if your eye's out
That's a hard price

I check it out with my drapes and sing

I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming

I'm back where I belong (Yeah)
I never felt so strong, man (I'm back, baby)
I feel like there's nothing I can't try
And if you feel me put your hands high (Put your hands high)
If you ever lost a light before, this one's for you
(Baby, put your hands high)
And you, the dreams are for you

[Verse 1: Diddy]
I hear the ""Tears of a Clown,"" uh, I hate that song
I always feel like they're talking to me, when it comes on (come on)
Another day, another dawn
Another Keisha, nice to meet ya, get the math, I'm gone
What am I supposed to do when the club lights come on?
It's easy to be Puff but it's harder to be Sean
What if my twins ask why I ain't marry their mom?
Damn, how do I respond?
What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown?
Shit! But I ain't finished growing
Another night, the inevitable prolongs
Another day, another dawn
Just tell Keisha and Teresa I'll be better in the morn'
(I'll be better in the morn')
Another lie that I carry on
I need to get back to the place where I belong

“A House Is Not a Home,” I hate this song
Is a house really a home when your loved ones is gone?
And niggas got the nerve to blame you for it
And you know you woulda took the bullet if you saw it
But you felt it, and still feel it
And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it (Deal with it), and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, playboy, and we keep ballin' (Ballin')
Baby, we been living in sin
Cause we been really in love, but we been living as friends
So you've been a guest in your own home
It's time to make your house your home
Pick up your phone, come on

“Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” I love that song
Whenever it comes on, it makes me feel strong
I thought I told y'all that we won't stop
Til we back cruisin through Harlem, these old blocks
It's what made me, saved me, drove me crazy
Drove me away, then embraced me
Forgave me for all of my shortcomings
Welcome to my homecoming
Yeah, it's been a long time coming
Lot of fights, lot of scars, lot of bottles
Lot of cars, lot of ups, lot of downs
Made it back, lost my dog (I miss you Big!)
But here I stand (Here I stand), a better man (Don't stop)

Defend my honor, protect my pride

But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up

Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, cause I made more on my second leg
Muthafuckin' Birdman Jr., 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take

Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

Would've came back for you
I just needed time, to do what I had to do
Caught in the life, I can't let it go, whether that's right, I will never know
Hoping you will forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back
Would've came back, would've came back
Would've came -

[Verse 3: Drake]
I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

33,Back To December,"Ali Eleot - Back To December



I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

This is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

Tears, we cried a flood

Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone

Then all my troubles will be gone

[Verse 2: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know

Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me

I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me déjà vu
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

36,Somewhere With You,"[Verse 1]
If you're going out with someone new
I'm going out with someone too
I won't feel sorry for me, I'm getting drunk
But I'd much rather be somewhere with you

[Chorus 1]
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

[Chorus 2]
You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

[Verse 2]
I won't sit outside your house
And wait for the lights to go out
Call up an ex to rescue me, climb in their bed
When I'd much rather sleep somewhere with you

Like we did on the beach last summer
When the rain came down and we took cover
Down in your car, out by the pier
You laid me down, whispered in my ear

I hate my life, hold on to me
Ah, if you ever decide to leave
Then I'll go, I'll go, I'll go

[Chorus 3]
I can go out every night of the week
Can go home with anybody I meet
But it's just a temporary high cause when I close my eyes
I'm somewhere with you, somewhere with you

If you see me out on the town
And it looks like I'm burning it down
You won't ask and I won't say
But in my heart I'm always somewhere with you

[Chorus 1]
Laughing loud on a carnival ride, yeah
Driving around on a Saturday night
You made fun of me for singing my song
Got a hotel room just to turn you on

[Chorus 2]
You said pick me up at three a.m
You're fighting with your mom again
And I'd go, I'd go, I'd go somewhere with you

Can go home with anybody I meet

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down

Don't wanna see you (no more)

I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

38,My Kinda Party,"[Verse 1]
I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscadine wine

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Verse 2]
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay

Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party

39,Love The Way You Lie,"[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

Said her name was a hand me down name
From the side of a family that long ago came
Over here on a boat from somewhere in Spain
Sounded to me just a little bit strange, I guess
But I have to admit, it felt good on my lips

[Verse 2]
She tipped the DJ to play her favorite song
A Spanish little number that was a rocking on strong
She grabbed me by the sleeve and said, ""Let's go and get it on""
By the second chorus I was singing right along with it
I don’t know what it meant but it felt good on my lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

[Chorus]
Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

[Verse 3]
She ordered us a drink, it was a purple kind of pink
She said it’s got a shot of a little bit of everything
Mellow yellow umbrella for a fella like me
It was just a bit mellow for me to be seen with
But I took a sip, yeah it felt good on my lips

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
You can go crazy too
Oh oh oh I, I wanna go crazy
I wanna go crazy with you

[Chorus]
Everybody saying whoa how sweet it is
Whoa yeah it felt good on my lips

[Verse 4]
When the lights came on and they hollered last call
I was busy getting lost in her cherry lip gloss
In a little corner booth, eye to eye no talk
She leaned in close and gave me one long
And wet Goodnight goodbye kiss and It felt good on my lips

Feel like it don't make s-s-s-s-sense

I'm thinking baby you and I are undeniable
But I'm findin' out love's unreliable
I'm giving all I got to make you stay
Or am I just a roadblock in your way?
'Cause you're a pretty little windstorm
Out on the boulevard
Something like a sunset
Oh, you're a shooting star
And I might drive myself insane
If those lips aren't speaking my name

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down
To counter this addiction
You got me on a mission
Tell me darling can I get a break some-
How could I say no?

Girl's got a love like woe!

Love so strong, then you moved on
Now I'm hung up in suspense
Because you're bringing me in and then you're kicking me out again

[Verse 2]
It's like a hurricane, speed train
She's a moving car
Catch her in the fast lane
Oh, I gotta know
Can I keep up with her pace?
Kick it into gear when I see that face
You can take up all my time 'cause you're the only one
That can make a storm cloud break
Pulling out the sun
And I can't get caught in the rain
Can I get your lips to speak my name?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've got some intuition or maybe I'm superstitious
But I think you're a pretty sweet pill that I'm swallowing down

We never spoke a word
But every thought she had, I heard
From across the room
We were standing face to face
I couldn't find the words to say
Give me one more move
I don't even know her name
I guess foolish pride's to blame

[Chorus: Zac Brown]
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away
And my heart won't tell my mind
To tell my mouth what it should say
I may have lost this battle
Live to fight another day
Now I'm falling in love as she's walking away

Wise man next to me did say
About the one that got away
Son, I missed my chance
Don't you let regret take place
Of the dreams you have to chase
Ask her to dance

You might fall down on your face
Roll the dice and have some faith

Don't be falling in love as she's walking away

47,Dog Days Are Over,"[Verse 1]
Happiness hit her, like a train on a track
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come

[Bridge]
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh

[Verse 2]
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back, back, back...
Struck from a great height
By someone who should know better than that

[Chorus]
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

Mama, you taught me to do the right things
So now you have to let your baby fly
You've given me everything that I will need
To make it through this crazy thing called life

And only want what's best for me
And I think I found the answer to your prayers

No, he's never gonna leave

I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)

[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay
(Oh, baby, don't hold out)
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]
I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)

I really can't stay

67,Rolling In The Deep,"[Verse 1]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out, and then I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

[Pre-Chorus]
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all

The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

[Verse 3]
Throw your soul through every open door (oh-oh)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa-oh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (oh-oh)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you – never had met me)
We could have had it all

[Chorus]
Voices in my head sayin' I could do better, damn
Voices in my head sayin' that I knew better
(You know better, what the fuck!)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

[Chorus]
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)
Voices in my head saying that I knew better
(Yeah, you know what's about to go down)
I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still, fuck

Part 2: ""Stick to the Plan""

[Bridge]
Voices in my head, conscience talking to me like
Look
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

[Chorus]
Stick to the plan, stick to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing
Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)

[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head",Big Sean,2010,"[69, 77, 81, 81, 91, 89]",6

Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

73,Waiting For The End,"[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning

But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm

Roll up, all night, I been running from the sun
Trying to bring the trophy back, to the city

We on, everything is a go, never take a T.O. (here we go)
I know you missed me...

77,Someone Else Calling You Baby,"[Verse 1]
I saw a truck backing out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messing with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whispering
A tear in your eye says I should have been listening

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Verse 2]
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I aren’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone

[Chorus]
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This being in the dark
Goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?

[Outro]
No goodbye aren’t never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No, don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Is someone else calling you baby?",Luke Bryan,2010,"[78, 75, 78, 80, 86, 96, 100]",7

Damn

Ugh

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my old girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them hoes take a hike
Then it’s on to the next—on—on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

[Chorus: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that ass, don’t compare, at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

All I want is you, mmh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
All I want is you, ooh-ooh, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

[Bridge: Miguel & J. Cole]
Cause they don’t smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don’t make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don’t photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it (yeah) I can’t replace it (yeah)
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal shit
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I’m kidding? Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be?
Lost in the player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say, ""I’m wrong"", you say, ""Come again?""
Damn, said I was wrong, look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes, how they coming in
Just sayin', don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I’m prayin', you ain’t content with tryna do your thang
And come back baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

[Chorus: Miguel]
That's why all I want is you now
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar

83,Bullets In The Gun,"[Verse 1]
They used to call me lightning
I was always quick to strike
Had everything I own
In the saddles on my bike
I had a reputation
For never staying very long
Just like a wild and restless drifter
Like a cowboy in a song

[Verse 2]
I met a dark haired beauty
Where they lay the whiskey down
In southern Arizona
In a little border town
She had to dance for money
In that dusty old saloon
I dropped a dollar in the jukebox
Played that girl a tune, yea

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

[Verse 3]
She was sitting on my lap
We still had shots to kill
When a man pulled up
Who owned the bar
In a Cadillac DeVille
He grabbed her by her raven hair
And threw her on the floor
Said no free rides for the cowboys
That ain't what I pay you for, no

[Verse 4]
She jumped up and grabbed my pistol
Stuck it in the fat man's back
Said open up the safe
And put your money in the sack
Then tied his hands behind him
And put a blindfold on his eyes
Said if you're dumb enough to chase us, man
You're dumb enough to die

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun, yeah

[Verse 5]
We rode across the border
Down into Mexico
When you're running from the law
Ain't that where everybody goes
We came to a town
With a name I could not spell
She gave me what I came for
In that Mexican motel

[Verse 6]
I woke up to sirens
And the sound of running feet
There were fifty Federales
Locked and loaded in the street
She grabbed my .44
I grabbed the money in the sack
She kissed me for the last time
And we headed out the back

[Bridge]
Every gun was on us
And every heartbeat pounded
There's only one thing left to do
When they got you all surrounded
She fired that old pistol
But we didn't stand a prayer
Money hit the gravel
Bullets filled the air

[Chorus]
Never see it coming
It just hits you by surprise
It's that cold place in your soul
That fire in her eyes
Makes you come together
Like wild horses when they run
Now the cards are on the table and
The bullets in the gun

But she don't wanna marry me

Bet she got on her dress now, welcoming the guests now

Doing a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask

87,Shake,"[JACQUES]
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

What's that motherfucking sound?
And I think I hear them nobs coming
Can they shut the whole place down?
I don't know about you, but I'm thinking about running
Everybody knows who the fuck they are
Everybody acts that they don't see the scars
When it comes down to it
Man I just don't think that these motherfuckers are that hard

Nah

They're stone cold thugs
They'll come in to your house and sell your newborn baby some drugs
Take your wife to the movies and then show her some love
And peace with the Homies, but expect no hugs
And you know they roll deep, better start praying
Cause it's all over when you hear them saying:

[Hook]

Nobs for lyf (4x)
Nobs for lyf
I can here them shouting
Nobs for lyf
And they will fuck your day up

[ImmortalHD]

ImmortalHD, bitches
If you got some love, show me
I'm the coolest motherfucker
Watching My Little Pony
And it's all for the nobs
Cause that's my fucking job
Go ahead and like this song
Or I'll call a fucking mob

Let's play, motherfuckers
All you nerds, come along
How many fucking f-words can we drop in to this song
I'm really not too sure
I fucking lost count
Now let's all sing together, while we burn this bitch down

[Hook]

Nobs for lyf (4x)
Nobs for lyf
I can here them shouting
Nobs for lyf
And they will fuck your day up

[Verse 1]
Every day I fight for all my future somethings
A thousand little wars I have to choose between
I could spend a lifetime earning things I don't need
But that's like chasing rainbows and comin' home empty

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'll be alright

[Chorus]
Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million
But you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that

[Verse 2]
I don't need a microphone (Yeah)
To say what I've been thinking
My heart is like a loudspeaker
That's always on eleven

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you strip me, strip it all away
If you strip me, what would you find?
If you strip me, strip it all away
I'm still the same

[Chorus]
Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million

You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that

[Bridge]
'Cause when it all boils down at the end of the day
It's what you do and say that makes you who you are
Makes you think about, think about it, doesn't it?
Sometimes all it takes is one voice

[Chorus]
Take what you want, steal my pride
Build me up or cut me down to size
Shut me out, but I'll just scream
I'm only one voice in a million
But you ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that from me (Oh-oh)
You ain't taking that
Take what you want, steal my pride

Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

Oh, wait, no I get it girl, I'm wit it
I've been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn, I wonder why I never learned my lesson
It's feeling like ya second chance and it's the first impression
And I heard there's nothin' new except for someone new
But how you s'posed to find the one when anyone'll come with you?
Talkin' to myself but I never listened
Cause man it's been a while and I swear that this one's different
That's why I'ma take you anyway you wanna go, let you meet my friends
So they can lecture me again about how reckless I have been
And I'm slowly runnin' out of all the time that I invested
Makin' all the same mistakes and I'm just tryin' to correct it
And I fall

96,One In A Million,"[Verse 1]
Guess I needed some time to get away
I needed some peace of mind, some peace of mind that'll stay
So I thumbed it down to 6th in L.A
Maybe a Greyhound could be my way

Police and niggers, that's right, get out of my way
Don't need to buy none of your gold chains today
Now, don't need no bracelets clamped in front of my back
Just need my ticket, 'til then, won't you cut me some slack

[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, that's what you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star
Maybe someday we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high

[Verse 2]
Immigrants and faggots, they make no sense to me
They come to our country and think they'll do as they please
Like start some mini Iran or spread some fucking disease
They talk so many God damn ways, it's all Greek to me
Well, some say I'm lazy and others say that's just me
Some say I'm crazy, I guess I'll always be
But it's been such a long time since I knew right from wrong
It's all the means to and end, I, I keep it moving along
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, you're a shooting star
You're one in a million, babe, you know that you are
Maybe some day we'll see you before you make us cry
You know we tried to reach you but you were much too high
Much too high, much too high, much too high, oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Radicals and racists, don't point your finger at me
I'm a small town white boy just trying to make ends meet
Don't need your religion, don't watch that much TV
Just making my living, baby, well, that's enough for me

[Chorus]
You're one in a million, yeah, you know that you are
You're one in a million, babe, you're a shooting star

106,Don't Cry For Me Argentina (Lea Michele Version),"[Verse 1: Lea Michele]
It won't be easy, you'll think it's strange
When I try to explain how I feel
That I still need your love after all that I've done
You won't believe me
All you will see is a girl you once knew
Although she's dressed up to the nines
At sixes and sevens with you
I had to let it happen, I had to change
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom
Running around, trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to

[Chorus: Lea Michele]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Verse 2: Lea Michele]
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions
They're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time
I love you and hope you love me

[Chorus: Lea Michele]
Don't cry for me Argentina
The truth is I never left you
All through my wild days
My mad existence
I kept my promise
Don't keep your distance

[Outro: Lea Michele]
Have I said too much?
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you
But all you have to do is look at me to know

When they take it off, everybody take it off

Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't; the real one's far too mean
The watered down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful—blasted-boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children; zip it; listen

Can we get much higher? So high

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
That's me, the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
""You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato?""
You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

Can we get much higher?

Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
Beyond the truest, hey, teacher, teacher
Tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

Can we get much higher? So high
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
(Saw the devil) in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

116,Crazy Beautiful Life,"[Verse 1]
I'm in love alright-ight-ight-ight
With my crazy beautiful life
With the parties, the disasters
With my friends all pretty and plastered
Every night we're down to go out
Wakin up on a different couch
'Til the next night, on the next flight
Yeah I guess we're doin alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, we're falling in love
Oh-oh-oh, 'til the sun's coming up
Oh-oh-oh, just living the life
Oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Every single night we fight to get a little high on life
To get a little something right, something real
At least we try
Time after time
Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life

[Verse 2]
I just hope some people see
There's nothin that I'm trying to be
Let me just stop all the ​shit​ talk
I know I'm the new bitch on the block
I've been through my sketchy phases
Been groped, been a shitty waitress
But I'm not now
Guess it worked out
Got here by running my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, we're falling in love
Oh-oh-oh, 'til the sun's coming up
Oh-oh-oh, just living the life

To get a little something right, something real

Try dodging all the douchebag guys
Try trading all the wasted times for something real in this crazy life

Can't we just stop time?
It's been a long five years
And nothing feels real to me

I need this more than anything
It's haunting each moment and I know it's my purpose
I can feel their eyes on me
I'm searching so desperately
The air it gets stifling but it's my life that I'm fighting for
You can't take that away

Show me the past, present, and future
I'm at the end of all I know here
Traveling the world from state to state
Anywhere that I can go
So, how do we (how do we) focus the point?
Make you look a little deeper than surface
Cause I won't (I won't) end up as a cliche

But go ahead and say no
C'mon give me your best shot
I see through the lies every time, not surprised
And it's so fucking overrated
Drop a new hit, you're all mad, send the hate in
Are you tuning in?
Are you watching us now?
Cause you haven't seen nothing
Are you tuning in?
Are you watching us now?
Cause you haven't seen nothing

I've been burying bad luck again and again
Like you think I don't know where I came from?
Cause there a whole line just waiting
Hoping for the fall
Watch this all fucking bury me
I hope you all know, I never forget and I won't let this go

But go ahead and say no
C'mon give me your best shot
I see through the lies every time, not surprised
And it's so fucking overrated

Cause you haven't seen nothing
Are you tuning in?
Are you watching us now?
Cause you haven't seen nothing

No, you haven't seen nothing

I showed it all but, you missed the point
You'll feel it when you miss it and you know it's gonna hurt. (I have shown it all. You'll feel it when I'm gone.)

But go ahead and say no
C'mon give me your best shot
I see through the lies every time, not surprised
And it's so fucking overrated

Hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh
Put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats
Then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold
Don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up

To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back, that the world is theirs

Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys

You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment

Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club

G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world

These are facts from a winner

You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe we were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side

[Chorus: CeeLo Green]
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side",Kid Cudi,2010,[92],1
136,Holding You Down (Goin In Circles),"(Intro)
Why can't I find somebody else
When I know, know that you're doing wrong
It's so hard, hard to let go

(Verse 1)
I done went through just about two bags of tissues baby
And you're looking at me like you ain't the issue baby
And though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby
And I keep coming, I keep coming back

(Hook)
I keep going in circles, circles
'Round and 'round
And while you're doing me so wrong
I just keep holding you down
I feel so stupid, foolish
Loving you all this way
But what I can I say
But I wanna go
I wanna go but I keep coming back

(Verse 2)
Why I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)
When I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)
It's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you
I live for you baby
I'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act
Cause I keep coming, I keep coming back

(Hook)

I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you baby
I can't stop

(Bridge)
I stay cause I love you but I hate that I stay
You know I won't go that's why you treat me this way
I want to be happy though it hurts me so bad
Don't know what it is that keeps me coming back

Hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said hol' up (wait a minute)
I said freeze!

137,Airplanes,"[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics?
And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Outro: B.o.B]

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay, I'm young and I’m tatted, I get them bucks like an addict
Rockin' this Christian Dior, I spend so much on my fabric
I got a wifey at home and what she wants she can have it
And she in love with my stick, she say I work it like magic
Okay, now no need to panic, I'm on a beach where the sand is
Somewhere smokin' on medication, no, I won't need a bandage
Some would look at my age and try to say I'm young and I'm handsome
I say I'm filthy fuckin' rich, so I'm an old dirty bastard
And my crib's a disaster and my kush is the master
I was in my yellow car, but my Ferrari go faster
Soundin' like a band in it and my diamonds the dancers
On the remix with Kesha, 'bout to go see the cashier
On the grind, so now my watch has got a lot of diamonds in it
I look down and see a hundred thou' and think it's time to get it
Brought a lot of marijauna and I'm here to share it
No, it’s not a problem, better get it, then I won't be here tomorrow, lil' mama

We start out so cute in our baby pictures
That momma shot for our daddy, so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway, but hey, one day he'll remember
If not, he's human, I'm human, you human, we'll forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum, can't see how momma hates him
He's such a cool ass guy, then wonder why she date him
I'm only eight, I'm not old enough, guess it's complicated
Two parent dwellings, expellin' have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence, so it don't get negated
I was gon' save it for later, but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and frou-frou, but it's the 1980s
But now that we are cool-cool, she sippin' Irish Baileys
She say, ""Stacks, you’re true blue?"" I said, ""nah, I’m Navy""
I call her ""Keisha,"" she like it because it's hood to her
She call me ""André 6000"" because I'm good to her

Bad bitches, I got 2 with me, wit you, better make it two or three
Bad bitches know me, so don't bother introducin' me
They want me more than diamonds
Wipe me down bitch, I’m super clean
I’m hella cold, mega paid, making moves doing things
Bitches stay queued and they all wanna do the king
I’m boiling, royalty, knew it when I seen her
I was gonna take her, make her my new royal penis cleaner
My demeanor something special and this dick is so impressive
Bitch I bet you'd take it off and take it with you if I let you
I ain't trippin’, I’m just here, they couldn’t catch you and I got you
Bitch my swag on supernatural, get you pregnant looking at you

139,Farmer's Daughter,"Well I heard he needed some help on the farm
Somebody with a truck and two strong arms
Not scared of dirt and willin' to work
Till the sun goes down
So I pulled up and said I'm your man
I could start right now and we shook hands
He said the fence needs fixin',
The peaches need pickin'
And the cows need bringin round

I was haulin hay, I was feedin the hogs
And that summer sun had me sweatin like a dog
So I cooled off in the creek
Then it was back to work in the daggum heat
I was cussin' out loud, thinkin bout quitin'
Lookin' back now I'm sure glad I didn't
Cuz just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I caught glimpse of the farmer's daughter

She was just gettin' home from Panama city
She was all tanned up and my kinda pretty
When her eyes met mine
I was thinkin that I would sure love my job
As the days got shorter our talks got longer
The kisses got sweeter and the feelings got stronger
So we'd hop in the truck and get all tangled up
Every chance we got
We were down by the river all night long
When the sun came up I was sneakin' her home
And draggin my butt to work
With the smell of her perfume on my shirt
I'd be on the tractor she'd be on my mind
With that sun beatin' down on this back of mine
Just when I thought it couldn't get no hotter
I fell in love with the farmer's daughter
We got married last spring
Woah and there ain't no better life for me

I'm still haulin' hay and feedin' the hogs
And that summer sun has me sweatin' like a dog
So I cool off in the creek
And she brings me outta glass of sweet ice tea
I'm on the tractor and shes on my mind
And I can't wait till its quitin' time
And just when I think it can't get no hotter
I come home to the farmer's daughter

I'm a wreck, I'm out of time

I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

[Pre-Chorus: Matt]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

[Chorus: Matt]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

[Verse 2: Mark & Matt]
Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

[Chorus: Matt & Mark]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow

And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!

Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod

I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!

143,Lo Mejor De Mi Vida Eres Tu,"[Verse 1]
Yo me siento al fin feliz
La tristeza no es para mí
Que me importan lo que viví
Si me regalan el futuro no lo quiero sin ti

[Chorus]
Ay no me digas no
Si escondes algo dámelo
Porque llegó la hora de estar conmigo
Pues el destino así lo escribió
Si es amor, Abrázame con ganas
Si no lo es, tal vez será mañana
Estando juntos mi mundo se llena de luz
Lo mejor de mi vida eres tú

[Verse 2]
Me voy de fiesta si quieres ir (quiero ir!)
De buenos aires hasta Madrid (hay ole!)
Y sin dormirnos acabar con parís
Te juro que jamás te vas a arrepentir

Si es amor, Abrázame con ganas
Si no lo es, tal vez será mañana
Estando juntos mi mundo se llena de luz

Lo mejor lo mejor
Eres tú

[Bridge]
Suéltate el pelo y juega entre las olas (entre las olas)

144,Sparks Fly,"[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again

But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with

Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?

I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa

On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (she deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does

Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)

How come?

When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

Around, around, around, around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around, around, around, around

Part 2: Haunted

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

157,Last Kiss,"[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Chorus]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last",Taylor Swift,2010,[71],1

Now I put the blade down, darling
I wanna see the light of the mornin'

Sedative ease the pain on my wrist
I put the blade down, darling, oh
I stood in the dark wishin' the end was near
Now I found my heart, and I know I have worth here

159,Enchanted,"[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is where the fathers ain't livin', at least not with us
Might see em round the city and won’t even say wassup
When niggas play tough, won't even smile in mirrors
And we learn to fuck hoes off trial and error
Just a small town nigga, big city hustle
Glued to the TV, Jigga, Diddy, Russell
These were our heroes, strictly for them zeros
For that Robert De Niro, niggas reload on them kilos, uh
Dodgin them people, mad at myself 'cause
I done seen some things that I’d rather not tell
Shawty smoke crack and her boyfriend too
And sometimes he touch her daughter how them boyfriends do
Pull up to the club where my boys went too
See that yellow tape and the boys in blue
A nigga on a stretcher and though I never met ya
I'm thinkin' God bless ya, the city tryna get ya

[Bridge: J Cole]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes, know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet you bet your Momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts, screamin', ""We miss ya!""

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 2: Omen]
Yeah, let's see God, I know you only do what's best for me
But is it cool if we negotiate my destiny?
They always tellin’ me it’s temporary
Then why it's feelin' like a cemetery?
My dreams ain't got no obituaries
My city hurtin' and none of us well-equipped here
You heard me say I was ballin’, I probably meant tears
I’m trying to get clear, I’m tryna quit fear
Who wrote the scripts here?
These kids live their whole life just killing time
Running the race with no finish line
They tryna noose us with they ropes, but I'm finna climb
I think my foolish pride might become my suicide
But I ain't tryna go, no, baby
And through these lines and quotes you gotta find some hope
'Cause I ain't dying, my words gon’ last forever
You can hold the treasure
Look inside you can see a diamond in my mind
I'm tired of seeing dope fiends wiping they nose clean
Is my neighborhood just a smoke screen?
I think I'm in the dungeon fam, I see low green
Sons raised by both queens but it's no kings

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Come with me
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la
Come with me (La da-da-da, la la la la)
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La da-da-da, la la la la

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It seems like niggas either feel ya or they tryna kill ya
I face the sky and hope that God ain't acting unfamiliar
You play whatever cards he deal no matter how peculiar
They tell me that it's God’s will, I’m asking ""God, will ya
Heal a nigga from all this pain?"" Mama smokin' cocaine
As it rains out, am I to blame? Try to stay sane
So I came outside where they rock with them thangs out
To clear my mind, the same time they blew that boy brains out
But will it change? It's like niggas is free
But our minds still in the chains, brothers killing each other
The blood spill, it's a shame, will it ever slow up?
A lot of niggas getting older, but they never grow up
And do they sons like they fathers did and never show up
Don’t even cry about it, just another episode of life
Watch the whole season, nigga, no re-runs
The devil out here buying souls, nigga, no refunds

[Bridge]
Man, don’t let the city get ya
Fuck the horoscopes know the ropes like a wrestler
If them bullets wet ya bet ya momma need a tissue
Your face on the front of our shirts screaming we miss ya

[Outro]
Another day, another song
A mother prays, another gone
But still we play like ain't nothing wrong
Like ain't nothing wrong
'Cause ain't nothing wrong
Im not as fast, I’m not as tall
But before I pass, I gotta ball
I gotta ball, I gotta ball
Nigga, I gotta ball",J. Cole,2010,[75],1

161,Never Grow Up,"[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up",Taylor Swift,2010,[84],1
162,Long Live,"[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered",Taylor Swift,2010,[85],1
163,Time Warp,"[Verse 1: Riff-Raff (Magenta)]
It's astounding
Time is fleeting
Madness takes its toll
But listen closely..
(Not for very much longer)
I've got to keep control

[Pre-Chorus: Riff-Raff; Both]
I remember doing the Time Warp
Drinking those moments when
The blackness would hit me
And the void would be calling

[Hook: All]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[Chorus: The Criminologist; All]
It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

[Hook: All]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[Verse 2: Magenta (Riff-Raff)]
It's so dreamy
Oh, fantasy free me
So you can't see me
No, not at all
In another dimension
With voyeuristic intention
Well secluded, I see all
(With a bit of a mind flip)
You're into the time slip
(And nothing can ever be the same)
You're spaced out on sensation
(Like you're under sedation)

[Hook: All]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[Verse 3: Columbia]
Well I was walking down the street
Just a having a think
When a snake of a guy gave me an evil wink
He shook-a me up, he took me by surprise
He had a pick up truck and the devil's eyes
He stared at me and I felt a change
Time meant nothing, never would again

[Hook: All]
Let's do the Time Warp again
Let's do the Time Warp again

[Chorus: The Criminologist; All]
It's just a jump to the left
And then a step to the right
With your hands on your hips
You bring your knees in tight
But it's the pelvic thrust
That really drives you insane

Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth

Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope

For all these demons, wish I could just go on

Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I’m so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—

[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

Paso mucha' noche' pensándote
Yo no sé ni cómo ni cuándo fue (Eh)
Pero sólo sé que yo recordé (Eh-eh)
Cómo te lo hacía yo aquella vez (Oh-oh)
Sí, yo no puedo seguir solo (Jeje)
Pero sé que te boté (Pero sé; que te boté)

[Estribillo: Ozuna]
De mi vida te boté, yeh, y te boté (Oh-oh)
Te di banda y te solté, yo te solté (Oh-oh)

Baby, la vida e' un ciclo (Wuh)
Y lo que no sirve yo no lo reciclo (No)
Así que de mi vida muévete
Que si te lo meto e' pa' recordar un T.B.T., yeh (Yeh)
Ya yo me cansé de tus mentira'
Ahora hay una más dura que me tira (Yeh)
Todo tiene su final, todo expira (Yeh)
Tú ere' pasado y el pasado nunca vira
Arranca pal' carajo (¡Wuh!), mi cuerpo no te necesita (No)
Lo que pide e' un perreo sucio en La Placita
No creo que lo nuestro se repita
Dale, prende un Phillie, deja uno ready pa' ahorita, yeh (¡Brr!)

[Pre-Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Odio saber que en ti una ve' má' yo confié
Odio to' lo' ""te amo"" que mil vece' te texteé
Baby, mejor que tú, ahora tengo como die'
Lo nuestro iba en un Bugatti y te quedaste a pie

[Estribillo: Bad Bunny]
Yo te boté; te di banda y te solté, yo te solté
Pal' carajo te mandé, yo te mandé
Y a tu amiga me clavé, me la clavé
Fuck you, hijo 'e puta, yeh (¡Huh!)

[Verso 2: Darell]
(Esta e' la verdadera vuelta, ¿oíste, baby'?)
Bebé, yo te boté (¡Ja!)
Y desde que te di esa' botá', las gata' son de tre' en tre' (Eso e' así)
Si tú quiere', pregunta, si no me cree' (Baby)
Que ya no tengo estré', pa' completar las filas son express (¡Ja-ja!)
¿Tú viste cómo el mundo se te fue al revé'?
Y yo con ella en R.D. (Jajajaja), que me enamoró el día que la probé
Yo ya no creo que vuelva y te dé, mami, porque el servicio te lo cancelé
Si no respondo (¡Ja!) el problema va a tocar fondo
Mami, respira hondo mientra' te lo escondo (Eso e' así)
Contigo obliga'o hoy yo me pongo el condón
Pero postea'o a media cancha, baby, como Rondón (¡Ja!)
Yo a ti te di una sepultura dura (Eso e' así)
Yo sé que con el tiempo la herida se cura (Por ley)

Te lo juro por Dio' aunque por Dio' no se jura (¡Ra-ta-ta-tá!)

[Estribillo: Darell & Nio García]
Bebé, yo te boté (E' que bebé yo te boté)

Sin sentido y sin razón (Sin sentido y sin razón; ah)
Pero tengo un culo nuevo que me da mucho cariño
Y me chinga bien cabrón (Bien cabrón)

[Estribillo: Casper Mágico]
No te lo vo'a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal
Pero te superé y de mi vida te boté (Yo te boté)
Y te di banda y te solté (Y te solté)
Y de ti no quiero saber (Quiero saber)
Y pa'l carajo te mandé, hoy me voy a beber (Me voy a beber)

[Verso 4: Ozuna]
Ozuna
De mi vida te boté y yo sé que no ere' cualquiera
Me pasaré la vida entera preguntando a dónde fue
Pero tu amiga me textea siempre que ella me desea
Se tira una foto conmigo y me dice: ""Pa' que tú la veas""

[Refrán: Ozuna]
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido
De tu nombre, tus beso', tu cuerpo, tus gemido' (Oh)
Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh-oh, baby)
Prendo pa' ver si me olvido

Lo hacíamo' en el carro, me gritaba al oído
Cierro los ojo' y pienso en todo lo que hicimo', baby (Oh)

[Verso 5: Nio García]
¡Nio!
Yo te di confianza y me fallaste
Te burlaste de mí y me humillaste

Me siento cabrón porque no estás aquí
Así como viniste tú te puedes ir (Te puedes ir; ¡uh-yeh!)

No te voy a negar que te sufrí, la pasé mal

Y de mi vida te saqué, yo te saqué
Bebé, yo te boté

[Verso 6: Nicky Jam]
Miento si digo que no me hace falta cuando me rozaba tu piel
(Rozaba tu piel)
Miento si digo que no me hace falta que llames al amanecer
(Al amanecer)
Pidiéndome que te agarre bien duro en la cama y te haga mi mujer
(Te haga mi mujer)
Aprovecho el remix con Ozu' para mandarte pa'l carajo también

No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad

I’ve been thinking about everything that’s been said
I realize what’s at stake
From the moment I met you
I just ain’t been the same

I need you here in my life
And we both know, that’s a hard thing to find
Girl, I’m a good man and you’re a good woman
There’s so much more I want to discover, baby

If it’s love, it’ll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know baby
If it’s love, it last forever
It’ll just start to show

You know I played the field for the longest time
Was in and out of love
Oh I, oh I paid the price
Tell me can you comprehend what you make me feel
Heaven only knows why broken hearts can heal

I need you, here by my side
If you’re not in my world, boy
Ain’t nothing right
You’re a good man, and I’m a good woman too
There’s so much more to discover with you

If it’s love, it’ll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know baby
If it’s love,girl, it last forever
It’ll just start to show

Maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can find the time
Maybe we can settle down, girl
Boy, you know your heart is mine

Maybe we can find a way to love a little better
Maybe we can a way to keep it all together
Maybe have a little faith and pray for this love, love

[Instrumental]

If you want to leave me
Will you leave me in your mind?
And think of me some evening
In the evening of our lives
'Cause the way I am keeps changing
And I just need a little time
'Cause the sentiment of feelings
Leads to ordinary lives and I want mine

If you want to keep me
Will you help keep me alive?

And there's too much on my mind

All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid

Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said ""speak now""

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Chorus - Variation]
And you say
""Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door""
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
""Speak now""",Taylor Swift,2010,"[86, 45, 8]",3

The track is one of Rap Genius’ 30 most viewed songs, coming in with 1.8 million views.99. BIG KRIT ""REM""98. Lupe Fiasco ""Peace of paper/Cup of JAYZUS""97. Joey Badass ""#Longlivesteelo""
96. Meek Mill ""Lil Nigga Snupe""95. Logic ""Nasty""
Produced by DJ Don Cannon, this wordplay-heavy track puts Logic on display for all to see. None can ignore Def Jam’s latest signee; the double entendres are abundant and the flow hits code red. Serving as his first single of the year proved to be a successful venture, gaining tens of thousands of views on Rap Genius and creating a platform for his Young Sinatra: Welcome To Forever mixtape.

Drake, Rick Ross, & Lil Wayne ""No New Friends""“No New Friends” was the first single off DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success album. Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous ‘Drake Lean’ meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, “No New Friends” was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky ""Kush Coma""83. Rick Ross ft. Future ""No Games""

72. Tech N9ne ft. Serj Tankian ""Straight Out The Gate""71. ASAP Nast ft. Method Man ""Trillmatic""70. Kid Cudi ""Immortal""In an extremely personal ”Immortal”, Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud, this track saw Cudi handle all duties, production included. The drums hit hard, the harmonizing is uplifting and the strings melt your ears. Even an Adam Sandler sample made its way into the joint!

Mac lays down a characteristically hilarious hook and switches flows and voices as the bouncy beat from Chuck Inglish changes up. Q does his high-energy Q thing and blesses us with a nice ""FIGG SIDEEEEEEEE"" to wrap it all up.64. Lil B ""I Love You""63. Danny Brown ft. Purity Ring ""25 Bucks""62. Schoolboy Q ""Yay Yay""61. Wale ft. Tiara Thomas ""Bad""60. Lupe Fiasco ""SLR 2""
The fan requested “Control” response brought out Super Lupe for the second time and he was none too happy with the game. He called out multiple rappers while seamlessly changing flows and displaying classic Lupe lyricism. Oh yeah, and he made the song in just two hours!59. Mac Miller ""Objects In The Mirror""58. Earl Sweatshirt ft. Tyler, the Creator ""Whoa""57. Childish Gambino ft. Chance the Rapper ""Worst Guys""56. 2 Chainz ft. Pharrell ""Feds Watching""55. Rich Homie Quan ""Type Of Way""
One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That’s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem “Type of Way"". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State’s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54. Vic Mensa ""Orange Soda""53. Ace Hood ""Bugatti"" ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels ""Banana Clipper""51. YG ""My Nigga""50. Joey Bada$$ “Unorthodox”Joey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey’s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from “Summer Knights”, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49. Rocko “U.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)” ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler, the Creator “Answer”47. Joey Badass “'95 'Till Infinity”46. Hopsin “Hop Is Back”45. Isaiah Rashad “Shot U Down (Remix)” ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q”
TDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad’s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original “I Shot U Down”. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it’s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino “Sweatpants”
43. Tech N9ne “Fragile” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & ¡MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller “Red Dot Music” ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z “Oceans” ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole “Forbidden Fruit” ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album ""Born Sinner"". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T “Hold On” ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q “Man Of The Year”37. Earl Sweatshirt “Sunday” ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z “FuckwithmeyouknowIgotit” ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator “IFHY” ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler’s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there’s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell’s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z “Tom Ford”33. J Cole “Crooked Smile” ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar “Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix” ft. Jay Z
31. Chance The Rapper “Acid Rain” 30. Childish Gambino “Telegraph Ave (Oakland)”Perhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about “what ifs” and reminiscing about things lost – sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things – whether to try again, or to walk away for good – all that wandering isn’t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd’s “Oakland” literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator “Rusty” ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper “Favorite Song” ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg “Work (Remix)” ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James
26. Pusha T “King Push” 25. Chance The Rapper “Juice”The first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance’s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can’t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor’s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you’re headbanging through the verse though, you’re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you’re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake “Hold On We're Going Home” ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg “Shabba” ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole “Let Nas Down”21. Eminem “Berzerk""20. Drake “Worst Behavior”This Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy’s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin’ in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake’s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you’ll never get the timing right for that initial “.......WORST!”19. Earl Sweatshirt “Hive” ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, “Hive.” Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem “Love Game” ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could’ve come straight from the ‘50s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em’s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they’re always going to be playing the game of love!
17. Drake “Started From The Bottom”
“Started From The Bottom”, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did ‘start at the bottom’, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino “3005”The lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist’s development over the last two years. It’s a good sampling of the album’s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don’t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.
15. Chance The Rapper “Cocoa Butter Kisses” ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.
14. Jay Z “Holy Grail” ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on ""pigeons"" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky “1 Train” ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.
""1 Train"" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames

12. Schoolboy Q “Collard Greens” Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Español that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West “ Black Skinhead”When word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808’s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he’s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it’s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you’d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole “Power Trip” ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole’s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song “Dreams” is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake “Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2” ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn’t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he’s no longer the same

08. Pusha T “Numbers On The Boards”
My Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the “No Artwork” cover, “Numbers On The Boards” is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring “that feeling back”, and “Numbers On The Boards” knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha’s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. “Kanye West - Bound 2” ft. Charlie Wilson
“Bound 2” was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye’s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye’s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. “Bound 2” is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson’s magical voice. What’s not to like?! Well, many would actually say “the video”, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye’s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song’s video as a commentary on the “wack” quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem “Bad Guy”Sequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song “Stan,” fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what’s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan’s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem’s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are “just symbolic/Of not knowing what you had ‘til it’s gone.”  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T “Nosetalgia” ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you’re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC’s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick’s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. “Nosetalgia” is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It’s dope. 04. Kanye West “Blood On The Leaves”
Blood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it’s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye’s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT’s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you’re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye’s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song’s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius’ prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song’s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem “Rap God”
”Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on”. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day ""Rap God"" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views

Proving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It’s safe to say ""Rap God"" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing’s going to stop him.02. Big Sean “Control” ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.
However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop’s homeland. But oh no, it wasn’t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?
01. Kanye West “New Slaves” ft. Frank Ocean
""New Slaves"" is best described as an “open letter” from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it’s without a doubt one of Kanye’s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the “best verse of all time” and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it’s hard to disagree

The Chi-town native doesn’t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It’s been 8 months since the song’s release and the significance of ”New Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song’s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn’t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. ”New Slaves” invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the Matrix
Just as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.— Kanye West",Rap Genius,2010,[89],1

I’m already gooking, on my period, PMS'ing

You got a problem? Hoe address it (get there)

[Verse 1: Yung Miami]
Real bitches to the square
I’m speaking for the boss bitches
And not you hoes that be fucking for hair
'Bout my dog I'll slide, if it’s a lick I'll drive, to a nigga I'll lie!
Sleepy hoes better wake up!
And get your motherfucking cake up
Or get smoked like a Grape Dutch
If you fucking for a stack? Bitch, it ain’t much (nothin')
It’s a drought ‘round here, pussy went up (facts)
Now my feelings on E, I need to fill up
A new Benz, just to sit up
Condo on a beach just to kick up (kick up)
After the check, we can split up

My nigga fucking on me, and I’m stressing
Haters tryna knock me for the shit that I’m blessed with, period!
You got a problem? Hoe address it

[Verse 2: J.T.]
My nigga acting crazy, (nigga, what's up)
I’m ‘bout to get rid of his baby
His mama acting shady, his sister tryna spray me (what)
His homeboys wanna fuck me
And every bitch in the hood wanna fuck on him, because me (facts)
I ain’t got time for these niggas, cause these niggas ain’t nothin'
I ain’t tryna figure out, who he sucking and fucking
Bitch, I got other shit to stress about (stress about)
My bills late, money running out
Pull up, them stores, bitch, are running out
I gotta get it by any means (period)
And keep Miami close, cause these other hoes only switch teams
When I’m in the field, just know I play for keeps
And keep my grass cut, so these bitches won’t creep

[Chorus: J.T.]

179,Our Kind Of Love,"Our kind of love, our kind of passion
Burns with a heat so hard to bear
It's not a game, no fad or fashion
Our kind of love's for those who dare

I must be strong, I must be bolder
Cling to my dream and never tire
Each love denied leave people colder
New love rekindles every fire

I shan't betray my heart's desire
Even though we come
From different sides
We won't hide

I am in love, no one can blame me
Such is my story and my fate
My kind of love will never shame me
My love is stronger than their hate
My love is stronger than their hate

I shall cling to her with all my might
It's my right

Causing the broken hearts to mend

No matter what may occur in life, everyday with her is like, a plus

Sure enough, even though them chicks be hatin on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side, through whatever situation we gon' ride

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yah I said it)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you
Fuck you too, woo!

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice

[Verse 1: Joyner Lucas]
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'
You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of nines
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo)
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo)
Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw 4 like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo, woo)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me
Fuck you think? (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I got a couple of mansions
Still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
But to these kids it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers.""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!""
""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap
Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They know what button to press or what lever to pull
To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya digs in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
Of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
Like California wishin' rain to pour
In that drought, y'all been prayin' for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboy

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Eminem]
So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",Eminem,2010,[27],1

187,Miss Me,"[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said ""If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em""
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

Can you feel it?

Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he's so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-Century schizoid man)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fucking nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, god damn it, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How 'Ye doing? I'm surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I'm driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting
(So excit—so excit—so excit—so excit—)

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

They pass me by
All of those great romances
It’s as if you’re robbing me
Of my rightful chances
My picture clear
Everything seemed so easy

[Pre-Chorus 1: Amanda Seyfried]
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it’s different
I want you to know...

[Chorus: Amanda Seyfried & Dominic Cooper]
One of us is crying
One of us is lying in her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only waiting for a call
Sorry for himself
Feeling stupid, feeling small
Wishing he had never left at all

[Verse 2: Amanda Seyfried]
I saw myself
As a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away
From the heat and the action
Just like a child
Stubborn and misconceiving

That’s how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I’ve changed
And I want you to know

201,Ridin' Solo,"[Verse 1]
You said that you’d come back around
So I waited here for you
It feels like things are different now
Don’t know what’s false or what’s true
So I take myself somewhere far
Somewhere new
I can’t feel you
What am I supposed to do

[Verse 2]
I won’t look back on things that don’t look my way
‘Cause time has made me change
It won’t let me stay
Why should I care when you absolutely never did
Don’t you know that love
It works both ways

You can go, go, go
And leave me

Is it crazy that I almost thought I loved myself
Less than I had loved you
Does it really matter what is sittin’ in my cup
I know it don’t got much to do with you

Light up the weed
Now I’m forgetting you
I’m fine on the line
But I’ll swallow your heart and I
I can’t remember you

202,Only The Good Die Young,"[Verse 1]
Come out Virginia, don't let me wait
You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, they showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

[Verse 2]
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty, we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one

[Pre-Chorus]
So come on Virginia, show me a sign
Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darling only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

[Verse 3]
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul
And a cross of gold
But Virginia, they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me
When you were counting on your rosary

[Pre-Chorus]
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun
You know that only the good die young

[Chorus]
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

[Bridge]
Said, your mother told you ""All that I could give you was a reputation.""
Aw, she never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

You Catholic girls start much too late
Aw, but sooner or later it comes down to fate

203,The Only Exception,"[Verse 1]
When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it
And my mama swore that she would
Never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

[Chorus]
But, darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Verse 2]
Maybe I know, somewhere
Deep in my soul, that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways
To make it alone, but keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now, I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

[Chorus]
Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

[Bridge]
I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't, let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception

And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo

And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie

She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long

But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money

Or maybe every time I took a step I didn't wait for God
(wait for God)
I don't know but if I'm weak I know that He is strong (strong!)
He sees it, all the hurt inside of me that keeps me numb (uh!)
And if I keep this unforgiveness how do I move on
When it was His Son who took the cross from me where I belong
(Where I belong!)

Have the grace, erase my past mistakes now I have it all
Waiting for so long with this pain inside till I finally call (I did)
Maybe where I wasn't, true love is what it reminds me of (woo)
Never have I felt the peace like only you provide (Yeah)
You wanted me, even though you knew you would die (Die)
Who am I, a heart empty without you inside (Uh-huh)
More beautiful than the bluest sky

Then you come crashing in
Like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that I can't keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stayed the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang
'Til the day you came
Showing me a another way and all that my love can bring

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that I can't keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart
With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall so far so long
Time to hold, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you
Than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you

With half of my, half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
Half of my heart is the part of a girl who's never truly loved anything

Oh, half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it

Today, I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch
Just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man

Oh oh, yes I said it
I said it, I said it, 'cause I can

Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out, ""This is great!""

I bet my old man will be so proud of me

212,Like We Used To,"[Verse 1]
I can feel her breath as she's sleepin' next to me
Sharing pillows and cold feet
She can feel my heart, fell asleep to its beat
Under blankets and warm sheets

[Pre-Chorus]
If only I could be in that bed again
If only it were me instead of him

[Chorus]
Does he watch your favorite movies?
Does he hold you when you cry?
Does he let you tell him all your favorite parts when you've seen it a million times?
Does he sing to all your music while you dance to ""Purple Rain""?
Does he do all these things, like I used to?

[Verse 2]
Fourteen months and seven days ago
Oh, I know you know
How we felt about that night
Just your skin against the window

Happens all the time, love, (I always end up feelin' cheated)
You're on my mind, love, (or so that matter when I need it)
It happens all the time- love, yeah

[Chorus]
Will he love you like I loved you?
Will he tell you everyday?
Will he make you feel like you're invincible with every word he'll say?
Can you promise me if this one's right
Don't throw it all away
Can you do all these things?
Will you do all these things like we used to?

There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it

Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round

I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Intro Verse: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good blood-sucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
No matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple double, no assists
And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit
Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gon' do now?""
Whatever I wanna do, gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West, Jay Z & both]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
(I'm a motherfucking monster)
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles' heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I get it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, ""Dutty Wine"" it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give a F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki 'cause she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's Child's Play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster!

[Outro: Bon Iver & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (decide)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide (no)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows

This is times up
Put your signs up
They done picked my dude
Out the line up
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them
You see many you call
Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders
Should I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
Fuck the bullshit but just don’t fuck it raw
Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I’m going
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I’m fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Stepping on the bullshit, you can be my doormat
Y’all ain't going nowhere with that hating shit, four flat
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn’t all that
Yeah, now time’s getting shorter
Red Light on your head like a fucking recorder now
Don't you cross me, you do better crossing the border
So much money piled up, I’m a motherfucking hoarder

221,I Am Not A Human Being,"[Verse 1: IBCircuits]
Come through in new jeans, rocking brand new denim
My rhymes so lyrical they like potent vemon
Like a thirteen-track Rodeo there’s no Antidote
I’m up way higher than a mountain goat
Bitch got 8 vaginas, call her octopus
And I got that spur like a platypus
And I kill that pussy, call me assassin
Brand new lambo so every car I’m passin'
My bars so nice that’s rockstar nice
Life is a gamble, I got rockstar dice
IPhone 3, that’s a rockstar device
Sippin' lean outta cups with some rockstar ice
Got the Rolls Royce rollin' and a rollie on my wrist
All these haters talking, and I'm slowly getting pissed
Run up on me, catch a bullet when you piss
Everybody knows with the pistol I don't miss
Point a gun at ya head in the bathroom
Make you drop the toothpaste, yeah you’re crestfallen
Tech N9ne and Wayne the only real rappers ballin'
Yeah, I got two yachts, I need a paradox
Talk shit and we’ll pull up like a pair of socks
Got 13 bitches, call me Milo
Spraying down the Five-O
They’re all dead on arrival
Fuck being a pussy
You gotta be a dick to be hard
Golden credit card, makes all the girls crazy
Call it a wild card
Sneak in your yard
Don’t give a fuck if there’s a guard
Spittin' these poems like I’m a bard
And to all your haters I give no regard

[Verse 2: TeamJimmy]
Uh, king of the bar checking in
Fuck with me wrong, you skin and bones, like skeletons
Uh, codeine is my medicine
You playing with fire like my name was Kevin Federline
Uh, man, what a time to be alive
The snakes will snake, the fake’ll fade, the real survive
Remember back, when I was on, my feature grind
Now you can’t come, even close to, where we reside
On sprite, wrong right, cannot tell the difference
Get right or get left, in dirt with no assistance
Miss me or go missing, turn your mistress to a Mrs
These hoes knows to get their nose out of my business
Struggle bars, I know, you’ll need your time to write
Don’t cause a scene, we can shoot it out, like Michael Myers
I’ll flip the script, shoot movie clips, in your line of fire
You’ll end up missing, and they won’t, even try and find ya
I know that I’d better get it, try kill me, I’ll never let em
We gon hit the club and throw it up, umbrella weather
All bark and no bite, you caught up in the strobelights
Whether you do or don’t fight, you’ll get hit with the no dice
Uh, they try to kick us while we down and out
Then they begging for attention, so the people crowd around
Do you love us, do you hate us, are you really bout it now

Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers ""Bombs away""

And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

So hard to breathe this air that we call love (ooh)
Ain't nothin' worse than the hurt we receive from love (ooh yeah)
When you get hurt by the one you livin' for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

I love you more than I love myself
Lovin' you no more
I just, I can't, I just can’t be lovin' you no more
I love you more than I love myself

[Verse 1: Diddy]
Hurt with the heart that's bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
I'm going through hell to convince she love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I’m ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I about to do when her parents do not try

I love you more than I love myself

I’ve been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is tryin' to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, tryin' not to over think
Only 'cause I drove and I've done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there’s pieces of ya hair still sittin' in my sink
And you still got underwear that’s sittin' in the dryer
How come every time that you’re suspicious I’m a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that’s the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I’m gon' do?
Since everything that I’m trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But uh, you see the same one I’m missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same, baby, then we’d be for sure

[Bridge 2: Dirty Money]
So selfishly, you can only show feelings
When you feel yours in jeopardy
Oh, time, oh, time has changed and I’m no longer willing
Can't you see how my heart is bleeding?
I guess I…

So many places (Woo!) that you might say I've seen it all
But my favorite place is the warm embrace
Of holding your hair back in a bathroom stall

[Chorus]
Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth
So bittersweet (Woo! Woo! Woo!)

[Post-Chorus]
I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be

[Verse 2]
All that hate is gonna burn you up
It keeps me warm at night
Warmer than anyone
I think how many drinks I've had
No more in either hand
I'm slurring on purpose
And it's certainly worth it

[Chorus]
Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth
So bittersweet (Woo! Woo! Woo!)

[Post-Chorus]
I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be
I guess that is how it's got to be

[Bridge]
You and me, another proverbial tree
It's such a mystery why you're here (But I can't live without you)
And you became as clear as cellophane
My voice of reasoning
I don't think I can take the way you make me out to be
I'm just setting, I'm just setting a trap
And I'm not pulling, no
I'm not pulling for you (Oh yeah!)

[Chorus]
Everything I do is bittersweet
You could tell me secrets that I'll probably repeat
I'm not trying to hurt you, I just love to speak
It feels like we're pulling teeth
So bittersweet

It feels like we're pulling teeth
So bittersweet
It feels like we're pulling teeth

238,Erase Me,"[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you

[Bridge: Kid Cudi]
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I'm Yeezy, she say ""Hi, I'm Aria""
No, you a angel, you wave ""Hi"" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, ""No, not my Aria""
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you",Kid Cudi,2010,"[97, 78, 69, 62, 22]",5

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me

[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense

Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, ""I just don't care""?

The thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase
Have you ever felt this way?

Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?

The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

253,This Ain't Nothin',"He was standin' in the rubble
Of an old farmhouse outside Birmingham
When some on-the-scene reporter
Stuck a camera in the face of that old man

He said, ""Tell the folks, please mister, what are you gonna do
Now that this twister has taken all that's dear to you""
The old man just smiled and said, ""Boy, let me tell you somethin'
This ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam""

""And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
And I held her hand 'til her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I learned at an early age
There's things that matter, and there's things that don't
So if you're waitin' here for me to cry
I hate to disappoint you boy, but I won't""

Then he reached down in the rubble and picked up a photograph
Wiped the dirt off of it with the hand that he still had
He put it to his lips and he said, ""Man she was somethin'
But, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""I lost my daddy when I was eight years old
That cave-in at the Kincaid Mine left a big ol' hole
And I lost my baby brother, my best friend, and my left hand
In a no-win situation in a place called Vietnam""

""And last year, I watched my lovin' wife
Of fifty years waste away and die
We were holdin' hands when her heart of gold stopped pumpin'
So, this ain't nothin'""

He said, ""This ain't nothin' time won't erase
And this ain't nothin' money can't replace""

He said, ""You sit and watch your lovin' wife
Of fifty years fightin' for her life
Then you hold her hand 'til her heart of gold stops pumpin'
Yeah, boy that's somethin'""

254,Introducing Me,"[Verse 1]
I'm, I'm good at wasting time
I think lyrics need to rhyme
And you're not asking
But I'm trying to grow a mustache
I eat cheese, but only on pizza please
And sometimes on a homemade quesadilla
Otherwise it smells like feet to me, and I
I really like it when the moon looks like a toenail
And I love you when you say my name

[Chorus]
If you wanna know, here it goes:
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows if were close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress
But it's easier to let ya take a guess at the rest
But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
And my heart, well, you asked for it
For your perusing, at times confusing, slightly amusing
Introducing me

I never, trust a dog to watch my food
And I like to use the word dude
As a noun, or an adverb, or an adjective, and I
I've never really been into cars
I like really cool guitars and superheroes
And checks with lots of zeros on 'em
I love the sound of violins and making someone smile

[Chorus]
If you wanna know, here it goes:
Gonna tell ya there's a part of me that shows if were close
Gonna let you see everything
But remember that you asked for it
I'm trying to do my best to impress

But you wanna hear what lives in my brain
And my heart, well, you asked for it
For your perusing, at times confusing, possibly amusing

Well, you probably know more than you ever wanted to
So be careful when you ask next time

Going back to the corner where I first saw you
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying ""If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?""
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

[Chorus]
'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving
I'm not moving

Policeman says, ""Son, you can't stay here""
I say, ""There's someone I'm waiting for
If it's a day, a month, a year""
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go

Who's waiting on a girl, oh
There are no holes in his shoes

But you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'Cause you know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved
I'm the man who can't be moved

'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (find you're missing me)

Sparks fly, it's like electricity

Time stops, like everything around me is frozen
And nothing matters but these few moments
When you open my mind to things I've never seen

Almost like the puzzle piece I’ve been tryna find
Falls right into place, you’re all that it takes
My doubts fade away when I’m kissin' you

And all the questions I’ve been askin' in my head
Like, ""Are you the one? Should I really trust?""

Past loves, they never got very far
Walls up, make sure I guarded my heart
And I promised I wouldn't do this
'Til I knew it was right for me

No guy that I've met before
Could make me (Make me) feel so right and secure
And have you noticed I lose my focus
And the world around me disappears?

268,Mockingbird,"[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Hook 2]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)",Eminem,2010,"[99, 100, 95, 100]",4

270,Your Love Is My Drug,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug

I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

“At war with the world, yet worlds apart
To return is a promise I can’t make
You see, we together have The Callous Heart
Because Callous Hearts don’t break.”

[Verse 1]
Do you recall when you’d lay on my chest?
Now where you once slept just lays such an emptiness
We’re going through this phase where we feel nothing
Making out with ‘loneliness’
Cheating on each other with ‘regret’

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re so forgettable and miserable
I wrote for you a chorus to end it all:

[Chorus]
And in the rain, I screamed your name
So darling, just you shut your pretty mouth
I know I mean nothing to you now

[Verse 2]
Do you recall when he had you undressed?
So young and so blessed, a letterbomb with no address
You were young and nameless, guilty but blameless
We woke the neighbours screaming at the weather once again

[Pre-Chorus]
We’re so forgettable and miserable
So I wrote for you a chorus to end it all
You wanna know why it rains?

[Chorus]
And in the rain, I screamed your name
So darling, just you shut your pretty mouth
I know I mean nothing to you now

[Bridge]
And all the colours bleed in on themselves and I’m left so cold
When all I wanted was a hand to hold to watch the world explode
I was all of the things that you always dreamt and then never did
All of the lives that you could have led but then never lived
The midnight kids

[Chorus]
And in the rain, I screamed your name
So darling, just you shut your pretty mouth
I know I mean nothing to you now

And in the rain, I screamed your name
So darling, just you shut your pretty mouth
I know I mean nothing to you now",Creeper,2010,[96],1

{Inaudible Chatter}

[Verse 1]
Ohh!
Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long

Doesn't matter when you'd rather

Get up, and go out

We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box crankin' out the CCR
Had a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohh!
You better hang on if you're taggin' along
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'

Yeah, we get up, and go out
Me and all my friends
We drink up, we fall down
And then we do it all again
Yeah, just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

[Bridge 1]
Don't want a wristwatch or an alarm clock
To see what time it is
From the moment I wake up
I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day till we fall down
So we can do it all again

[Bridge 2]
It's not the human walk
It's the human race
If you ain't livin' on the edge
You're takin' too much space
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around
Hanging out this afternoon

Rosé baby, waste two stacks
Hottest thing in the lot, that there mine
Can't spell sober, lost my mind

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I'm hearin' voices in my head, think I'm schizo-frantic
I swear they sayin', let's get it from another planet
36, a thousand times, I'm doing somersaults
Do it right and you can live your whole Summer raw
I'm out my mind, yea a nigga seeing double y'all
Now tell me whats the chance of Jizzle fuckin' both of y'all?
She said ""as long as we can do it with your ice on""
If that's the case, we might as well leave the lights on

Guess what my momma told me, she hate my partners
Guess why she hate em though
Cause all of em robbin'
Fuck the police, cause all of them problems
White girls fun, cause all of them swallow
Why I ain't fuck her at the house
Cause the bitch hollered
And where the pill man at
She need a blue dolphin
Old broke-ass nigga: stop cock-blockin'
Security, I need help cause the bitch stalkin'
A half fuckin' mil', that's what the whip cost me
100 dollars: that's what the pussy cost me
And when the nigga start hating, that's when the nigga lost me

Drop the top, no bra, got her titties out
Mention my name and bring the whole city out

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go

Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)

My daddy spent his life looking up at the sky
He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Verse 2]
Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Bridge]
Farmer Johnson does a little dance
Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle

But I never told you
What I should have said
No, I never told you

And now I miss everything about you
I can't believe it, I still want you
After all the things we've been through
I miss everything about you
Without you

You make it hard to see
Where I belong to

What I should have said
No, I never told you

I know they say ""You can’t go home again""
I just had to come back one last time
Ma'am, I know you don't know me from Adam
But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Verse 2]
Mama cut out pictures of houses for years
From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to Mama's dream

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

[Bridge]
You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it

286,Pray For You,"[Chorus]
Oh, you're telling me I changed on you?
Just ’cause you ain't got no change on you?
But the blame's on you
Keep my ting, boy, I changed on who?
Don’t make me grab that chain from you
That's a shame on you
So much rules that I break for you
And still you can't even say the truth?
I gotta let you go
Certain man are gonna make the news
While I'm out here makin' moves
But I'll pray for you

[Verse 1]
They're gonna tell you that they love you when it benefits
But the second that it doesn't, you’re irrelevant
So it’s only day ones that I'm steppin’ with
And any other nigga actin' salty can get peppered quick
I caught niggas doin' funny shit a couple times
And when I asked 'em ’bout it, they told me a couple lies
Man, you can put it on your sister or your mother's life
But I know the truth 'cause I can see it in them brothers' eyes
That wasn't part of the plan, no, we ain't part of a gang
But we just grew up in the same trench
Runnin' from the same feds, jumpin' over same fence
Lookin' at my pendant like I wondered where the rain went
And no lie, I put seven hundred grams of Benzocaine in my whole nine
And press it for the whole night
And when I go back to my trap in the morning
I dash it all down and feel i'm actually ballin'

[Chorus]
Oh, you're telling me I changed on you?
Just 'cause you ain't got no change on you?
But the blame's on you
Keep my ting, boy, I changed on who?
Don't make me grab that chain from you
That's a shame on you
So much rules that I break for you
And still you can't even say the truth?
I gotta let you go
Certain man are gonna make the news
While I'm out here makin' moves
But I'll pray for you

[Verse 2]
My nigga Melo just came out the can
So you know I had to put somethin' straight in his hand
And it wasn't from no trap, it came straight from the bank
Boy, you know I'm washin' up money big from the trap
Only time that they caught me lackin'
Your block saw a couples shootings and some naughty steppings
Could've sent my lil' niggas but I'm for the action
This is more than rappin'
Walkin' with a ten, I don't need to talk on that
'Cause we're in the thick of it
I was 13 on the block, hittin' little bits
Now when I'm look in my pop, there's a brick in it
I poured the mix and triple it
But still I'm on the millions, takin' pictures with the little kids
But no lie, for my young boy guilty
For the murder, I'm like, ""Oh my, he's gonna get us all life""
So when I go back to my yard in the evening
I'm looking to the sky, thankin' God for this freedom

Oh, you're telling me I changed on you?
Just 'cause you ain't got no change on you?

But enough about me, let me think should I be worryin' about if I can handle you?

Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me, I'm bossing up, pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's
Back to back, set a trap, hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track, bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin

Tell me if that's okay
Know, I'll be on my way
Should've known, now I feel insane
Am I insane?

I've waited way too long
Yeah, I know you've changed
You have a different face to me
I guess that I was wrong
I'm the one to blame
And that's a shame, you see

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're in my head
And I keep on forgettin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you're here instead
And it seems never ending

You don't feel the same

You say it's all alright
But you're not who's up at night
You'll probably say ""we tried""
This feels like all a lie
While you tend to try and hide
Your hold has got me tight

And nothing else is right
You're laced inside my mind
I'm holding on, I know it's wrong
But I can't see your side
And everything has changed
You're only in my brain
I can't seem to let this be

I've broken my heart so many times I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up then I let myself down

[Pre-Chorus]
I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

[Verse 2]
I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

All the B's that'll bleed and they sleep and they eat
Shit believe the thought we're all equal
Ain't a man on God's green be underneath any other
I don't wanna play preacher
But but I swear they turn their ear when we talk about peace and love
Sometimes might need a hug yea we all wanna come on up above
But this ain't about Jesus, no way, no Abe, no Ike, Moses or Mohammed
Yea it's all about believing, full steam ahead
Because I know the worst times are behind me
I don't wanna sound cheesy but but but I justa really mean it eh eh yea

Bout time to change a few things
We enslaved to the bank and we only wanna buy new shoes
The way that we think
We can do anything that we really wanna put our minds too
The american dream, the dream is a pyramid scheme, scheme
And it feels outta reach when it's hard and times are tough
But change starts with us yep, yep
We all want freedom yea to be who we be
I don't wanna be afraid when I speak to say what I'm feeling
Yea together we're strong but divided never been so weak
It's time we get even, yea yea, and really what I mean is, is, is
This change I can feel it, yea yea, Mr. President I think it's all gonna be O.K

(go, go, go, go, go, go)
I, I, I, I, I, I've been on my grind

So it's not about fame, and fortune
It's about believing and believing in yourself
And understanding that this life is life
It's liberty and the pursuit of happiness
And happiness isn't about getting what you want all the time
It's about loving what you have
So get ready it's a new day

294,Nightmare,"[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time

I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing

I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time

So I'd know yesterday was over
I put all your books on the top shelf
Even the one with the four leaf clover
Man, I'm getting older

I took all your pictures off the wall
And wrapped them in a newspaper blanket
I haven't slept in what seems like a century
And now I can barely breathe

Just like a crow chasing the butterfly
Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away
I guess I was just a little too late

Your words still serenade me
Your lullabies won't let me sleep
I've never heard such a haunting melody
Oh, it's killing me
You know I can barely breathe

Dandelions lost in the summer sky
When you and I were getting high as outer space
I never thought you'd slip away

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch: Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me neither""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame
And I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?

For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy

Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan

I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged

300,Ordinary Girl,"[Verse 1]
Louis sneakers, Kylie lip kit, Cartier bracelet
Could live life without fancy things
Loving life in my ripped jeans
Takin’ Snapchat selfies
I celebrate everyday, trying to be

[Chorus]
Just an ordinary girl in this extra ordinary world
I’m a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinary girl

[Verse 2]
Eyes on the big stage, mind on the test l take
Live stream, study breaks
Long nights make longer days
Some day I wanna do big things
But I don’t gotta be Superman
Stars are just dreams, work hard and reach
And you can do anything

[Chorus]
Just an ordinary girl in this extra ordinary world
I’m a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinary girl

[Bridge]
Keep you eyes ahead and don’t look back at what you’ve been
If you keep going, time will tell you when it’s right
Make your philosophy to live in belief of what you dream

[Chorus]
Not an ordinary girl in this extra ordinary world
Not  a typical teen, living out dreams
Watching life take shape, taking it day by day
It can happen to you, it can happen to me
Just to any ordinarygirl

And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 1]
Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
A violence prone, poor people zone
But it's my home, all I have known
Where I got grown, streets we would roam

Out of the darkness, I came the farthest
Among the hardest survival
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat

So we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that fateful day
It's not far away, but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

[Verse 2]
So many wars, settling scores
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor
I heard them say 'love is the way'
'Love is the answer,' that's what they say

But look how they treat us, make us believers
We fight their battles, then they deceive us
Try to control us, they couldn't hold us
Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers

But we struggling, fighting to eat
And we wondering, when we'll be free
So we patiently wait for that faithful day
It's not far away but for now we say

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

When I get older I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, and then it goes
And then it goes

And everybody will be singing it
And you and I will be singing it
And we all will be singing it

[Chorus]
When I get older, I will be stronger
They'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag
And then it goes back, and then it goes back
And then it goes back, oh

When I get older, when I get older
I will be stronger just like a wavin' flag
Just like a wavin' flag, just like a wavin' flag

Soon as we get started making love going hard
I hear a knock, knock, knocking on the wall
And as soon as I go deep getting it in, then again
There's a knock, knock, knocking on the wall

312,Up On The Ridge,"[Verse 1]
Let's blow out these city lights
Let's just leave it all behind
Get up where the air is still
You can hear the whippoorwill
Start a fire, pass the 'shine
Won't be home 'til morning time
Shout your name out in the wind
Confess my love for you again
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

[Verse 2]
Hey, now, honey child
We'd be running free and wild
No one care what you do
Ain't no law to answer to
Dance around in the dirt
Listen to them crickets chirp
Hear old Jake start to howl
When he hears that old hoot owl
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

[Verse 3]
Come on, girl, it's almost dawn
Let's get it 'fore the magic's gone
Tall, tall grass all around
Come on lay that blanket down
Wild flowers just like you
Lay on me like morning dew
Now take my hand walk with me
Sun come up through them trees
Give you all I got to give
That's how we live up on the ridge

[Chorus]
Won't you come with me tonight
Where moonlight drips into your eyes
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge
I just want one little kiss
When we get high up on the ridge

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood, let's go
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone

314,Young Forever,"[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)

Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)

And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit

Brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl, I'm too for real, lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid, you will feel
What I do, I do at will
Shootin' from the hip, yeah, boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my deathbed
Screamin', “F that!” – yeah, super-ill
Baby, what the deal? We can chill
Split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak, slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt 'fore I foot the bill
Listen, garden tool, don't make me introduce you
To my power tool, you know the fuckin' drill
How you douchebags feel knowin' you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby, crank the shit, 'cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well, shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at, man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium
And said, “Settle your fuckin' ass down!
I'm ready for combat, man!”
Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans
'Cause they fuckin' go bananas
Honey, I applaud that ass
Swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a goddamn Taz, yeah

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Girl, shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers
Playin' with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess
Who's knockin' at your door, people hit the floors
Yeah, tonight, ladies, you gon' get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'ma hit you broads
With Chris's force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue, ma'fucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Makin' cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef layin' on your kitchen floor
Other words, I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back, bring in two extension cords
I'ma measure my dick—shit, I need six inches more
Fuck, my dick's big, bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fuckin' swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted, I'm dope
I'm the longest needle around here—need a fix, ock?
I'm the big shot—get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl, you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter
Better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
White trash with a half a six-pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch attached to the back, dispatch

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Bitch, am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'?
Does a bird chirp? Does Lil' Wayne slurp 'zurp
'Til he burps and smoke purp?
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
I'd like you to remind yourself of what the fuck I can do
When I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a likin' to
Psych! I'm spikin' you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain—bitch, you listenin'?
Tryin' to turn me down, slut, I'm talkin' to you
Turn me back up! Are you insane?!
Tryin' to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playin'!
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? Where there's thunder, there is lightning
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
In three different locations on four separate occasions?
And you can bet your stankin' ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinkin' rash
So hit the dance-floor, cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone; shake your booty, shorty!
I'm the shit—why you think Proof used to call me ""Doody""?

[Chorus: P!nk]
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no, I won't back down, oh no",Eminem,2010,[62],1
321,Cold Wind Blows,"[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Intro]
'Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
Some want a bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game, whoa
But it shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice you remain, fuck 'em all
Tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again

[Ad-Libs]
God damn!
Is it that time again already?
Haha, okay
Y'all don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck, man
Don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right
Fuck y’all then!

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog—fall back, you mutts!
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it, a sick duck, I want my duck sicked, mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble 'em up, trick, yummy
Bitch, you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit, honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty, dance, while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah, struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucker, might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, 'cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on 'cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the Buddha, light a bong, but take a look at Mariah
Next time I inspire you to write a song—come on!

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Fuck it, I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Y'all are sittin' ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Motherfucker, I'll show you pussy-footin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 'til it makes a queef
And sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin'?
You musta mistook me for some sissy soft punk
Lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead, fuckin' hater, push me!
I told you ain't no fuckin' way to shush me
Call me a faggot 'cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up, all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down, ""Shady ease up!
Man, chill!"" Nah, I can't, goddamn it, rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit, the day that happens the world will stop spinnin'
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During an earthquake, urine in your face
'Cause you're fake (*lightning noise*)  Ow! What the fuck? That hurt, wait!
(*Lightning noise*) Ow! What the fuck? I just got struck by lightnin'
Alright then, I quit, God, I give up
Call it evil that men do
Lord, forgive me for what my pen do
""This is for your sins, I cleanse you
And you can repent, but I warn you
If you continue, to Hell I'll send you""
And just then the wind blew, and I said...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day
'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
""So long,"" 'til then, I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it, you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
""Oh, bitches don't like that,"" homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin'
Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
So, don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah
I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-Tune
The last thing you want to do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say, ""I was writing this and I thought of you,"" so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty below
Ask me why, man, I just don't know
No-no-no, no-no, no
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
Blow-blow-blows
Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know
But I'll probably be this way 'til my dyin' day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold
Mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me",Eminem,2010,[71],1
322,Stay,"[Verse 1]
Waiting for the time to pass you by
Hope the winds of change will change your mind
I could give a thousand reasons why
And I know you, and you've got to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Make it on your own, but we don't have to grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a thousand reasons why
But you're going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Verse 2]
Won't admit what I already know
I've never been the best at letting go
I don't wanna spend the night alone
Guess I need you, and I need to

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Make it on my own, but I don't wanna grow up
We can stay forever young
Living on my sofa, drinking rum and cola
Underneath the rising sun
I could give a million reasons why
But I'm going, and you know that

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay

[Post-Chorus]
All you have to do is
All you have to do is stay

[Bridge]
All you have to do is stay
So stay, yeah

[Chorus]
All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is wait a second
Your hands on mine
The clock is ticking, so stay
All you have to do is stay",Zedd & Alessia Cara,2010,[75],1
323,I Keep On Loving You,"If the world keeps on turning as I'm sure it's bound to do
Then I'll keep on loving you
If the dawn comes tomorrow and we know that it's true
Then I'll keep of loving you
But what the thing changes sky should fall
The dawn wouldn't come, the world wouldn't stall
I wouldn't care as long as you're near
It wouldn't matter to me at all
If the stars stay in heaven and the moon stays in the blue
Then I'll keep of loving you
If ever should lose you then I know just what I'll do
I'll just keep on loving you
You're heaven to me dear, you my every dream come true
And I'll keep of loving you
Life is so sweet when you are near
I couldn't do without you my dear
I love you so I want you to know
I think of you wherever I go
I will always be faithful and I'm sure that you'll be too
And I'll keep of loving you","Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, & Ray Price",2010,"[85, 78, 79, 84, 86, 90, 94, 90, 92, 90]",10
324,Talkin' 2 Myself,"[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins
On the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin' and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too
God, it feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself, you're slowly dyin'
You're denyin' your health is declinin' with your self-esteem
You're cryin' out for help

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself
Do something 'bout it, admit you got a problem
Your brain is clouded, you pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, let me hear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)

325,Up All Night,"[Verse 1: Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full: I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I-I-I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it
All up in your face man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night, whole crew's in here
Cause I don't really know who I'ma lose this year
Aww, man I love my team
Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, aww

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Drizzy say get her, I'ma get her
I got the kind of money, that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda—wait, wait—fixate
Which bitch, you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the Peach State
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed
M6 in front of M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect 100 thou' at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money 'til the death of me

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man, fuck what they be talkin' about
They opinion doesn't count, we the only thing that matters
Aww, so we do it how we do it

I mean, we can't even rock them shoes
If it don't got a comma on the price tag, you know?
I mean, I mean but then again
Who, who looks at the price tag, you know?
Aww yeah we in this bitch (uhh)

326,25 To Life,"[Produced by DJ Khalil & Danny Keyz]

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
Too late
(Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
I'm taking my life back)
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain
Bitch, you took me for granted
Took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it, now my respect, I demand it
I'ma take control of this relationship, command it
And I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?
Look at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left
But you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step
And I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in-depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left
I laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?
Yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate, but it's…

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(Yeah, can't take no more)
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh
‘Cause that ain't good enough
You expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap
Don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you – go marry someone else and make 'em famous!
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat
I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out, I fell for this
So many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this, I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a
Mess, cursed and blessed, but this time I
Ain't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss
You're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people
Who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you
My life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just...

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
(I'm gone, man)
Too late for the other side

Too late

[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block 'til I cut a kitten's head off
And stuck it in this kid's mailbox (Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it.""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic, whose eyes
Get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em, with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and, Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

330,9 AM In Dallas,"[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence

Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really going off, fireworks

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks

Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks

A door left open, a woman walking by
A drop in the water, a look in the eye
A phone on the table, a man on your side
Or someone that you think that you can trust
It's just another way to die

336,Solo,"[Verse 1]
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

[Verse 2]
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

[Chorus]
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven

We got lost, lines got crossed
And the light turned to static, babe
And then I jumped ship, got caught up in the current
And it carried both of us away
We were so much better
When we were together, baby

Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight

Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream

And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops

Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind
I know they will still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume?
It isn't easy, but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I would write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high
""To Sir, with love""

The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave
I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong, that's a lot to learn
What, what can I give you in return?

If you wanted the moon
I would try to make a start
But I would rather you let me give my heart

Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

[Verse 2]
Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Damn, has it been that long? (haha)
Say what happens since I been gone
They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time

[Hook]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart and I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, and you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go

[Verse 1]
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody wonder how I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true
Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect
Cause they more more closer
Cause I get it don't mean they do too
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know we never not goin all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna fit a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagant habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)

Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n NBA expansions
I was passin out Phantoms in 04 so no, dough ain't shit to me
Way past respect you see, but a nigga ain't even half as big as he finna be

[Hook]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go

(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go (go)

[Verse 2]
So fly why would I wanna land for
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fan or
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth
Nip it in the bud kill it like cancer
But when it rains, then it pours give a damn sure
In France, bonjour, merci, oui
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him shoulda kept your reciept
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free

[Bridge]
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in tha bag
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in the jet for a homie friend

I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?
If you recall, I was the one who used to move yay
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet, no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi, touché
If the king ain't back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100k downstairs by the trey pound
But if they wonderin who runnin the A now?

Yea you know, yea you know)

And we go, and we go (go)

Yeah you know that we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon blow where we drop
Let you know we on top

Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame everyone
You broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you got to break and make it feel so hard

Oh, and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard?

358,Beautiful Day,"[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stoney ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You love this town even if that doesn't ring true

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day

Reach me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering 'bout you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain

The holy or the broken Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch

And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Additional Lyrics]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah",Leonard Cohen,2010,"[76, 44, 86, 13, 48]",5

368,Roger That,"[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks, trick-or-treating the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow, flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me ""Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""
As-Salaam Alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've done penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Lear
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier
V.I.P. rosé; you can have a beer
'Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Smoke more than four quarters, we call it sudden death

Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me

Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet

I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet

I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life

So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside

A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmmmm

[Verse 2]
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages, I come lookin' for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there, lalalalalalala

[Verse 4]
Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange

After changes we are more or less the same

Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me
Leadin' me
Goin' home

[Verse 6]
In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving"", but the fighter still remains

The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?

Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 1]
Hey, who dat, who dat? That nigga you been waiting for
I mean the shit was all bad just a week ago
Rappers was bullshitting, fuck it I ain't hating though
Because now a nigga hot enough to fuck with one of Satan' hoes
And she can't tell the difference, I been through hell conditions
Wishing for air conditioning, feeling God was never listening
Now I'm on television, and did I fail to mention?
Your bitch is tired of missionary, boy you failed the mission
Speaking of positions just witness how I elevate it
Real niggas celebrate it, finger fuck whoever hate it
My life accelerated, but had to wait my turn
Then I redecorated, that mean my tables turned
Live life, might as well, only way to learn
Is try and fail, clientele the only way to earn
So if you're selling crack, or if you're selling rap
Make sure it's mean so them fiends keep on coming back

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
So don't worry about my motherfucking name

Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Verse 2]
Hey, the mind state of a winner
When you thinking about summertime I'm thinking about the winter
When you thinking about breakfast I'm heating up my dinner
I was plotting this moment back when y'all was riding spinners
Yeah I'm a menace, God as my witness, with this pen I'm insane, yup
Hungry like the nigga who ain't got the taste of fame yet
Clown told me, “Ain't you Roc? But where the fuck your chain at?”
Guess it's something like your girl, nigga it ain't came yet
The man make the chain, chain don't make the man
How many niggas do we know with hella ice but yet they lame?
The cloth from which we came me and them is not the same
It's like we all headed to Spain they took the boat I took the plane, damn
That boy's sick now hoes on his joystick
Heating up like May weather, dog I'm on that Floyd shit
Boy stick to your day job, said you was hot? Well, they lied
Is that your girl? Well, I just G'd her, no A-Rod

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame

Who dat, who dat? I got them saying
Who dat, who dat? Cole World
Who dat, who dat?

[Interlude: Andre 3000]
Now who else want to fuck with Hollywood Cole?

[Verse 3]
The little engine that could, this little nigga is good
Rappers claiming they sick, I heal niggas for good
A couple of y'all ain't took a field trip to the hood
And me? I'm fresh prince, I'm Will Smith to the hood
Baby, ain't saying names but we not the same
All the money and the fame don't change the fact that you lame
Might want to grab you a chain, want to tip up your hat
Might want to purchase some game, homey your shit is so wack
I got my finger on the trigger, tell that nigga, “hold that”
Want picture perfect baby you can check the Kodak
Hey, so anything you can do I can do better
And any chick you can screw I can get wetter
I'm young, black, gifted, live my life on the run
Bet your bottom dollar before I'm done
They say that I'm the one, ya nigga I'm the one
I got them saying

[Chorus]
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame
Who dat, who dat? Bitch I got that flame

382,I Dreamed A Dream,"I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they tear your dreams to shame

She slept a summer by my side
And filled my days with endless wonder
She took my childhood in her stride
But she was gone when autumn came

And still I dream she’ll come to me
And we will spend the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
There are storms we cannot weather

I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I’m living
So different now than what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed",Darren Criss,2010,"[96, 31]",2
383,Jessie's Girl,"[Verse 1]
Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know, he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl, and I wanna make her mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Verse 2]
I'll play along with this charade
That doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her, but the point is probably moot

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's lovin' him with that body
I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late, late at night

[Chorus]
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman...
Where can I find a woman like that?

[Bridge]
And I'm lookin' in the mirror all the time
Wonderin' what she don't see in me
I've been funny; I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love's supposed to be?

[Chorus]
Tell me where can I find a woman like that?
You know I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that?
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I want, I want Jessie's girl",Rick Springfield,2010,"[97, 64, 23]",3

385,Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever),"[Verse 1]
I was searching
You were on a mission
Then our hearts combined like
A neutron star collision
I have nothing left to lose
You took your time to choose
Then we told each other
With no trace of fear that...

[Chorus 1]
Our love would be forever
And if we die
We die together
And lie, I said never
'Cause our love would be forever

[Verse 2]
The world is broken
Halos fail to glisten
You try to make a difference but
No one wants to listen
Hail, the preachers, fake and proud
Their doctrines will be cloud
Then they'll dissipate
Like snowflakes in an ocean

[Chorus 2]
Love is forever
And we'll die, we'll die together
And lie, I said never
'Cause our love could be forever

[Bridge]
Now I've got nothing left to lose
You take your time to choose
I can tell you now without a trace of fear

[Verse 1]
Small talk I don't do that
Get rich homie, you knew that
It’s a damn shame, I don’t gang bang
But I beat a nigga blue black
I’m in the old school, no do-rag
Them old folk like how you do that?
He ain’t fooling me, this ain’t new to me
That ain’t an Aston Martin, that’s a new Jag
But it clean, though
And if you’re late on the payment, boy, that shit get repo’d
And your bitch easy, ha
I got her on the line and I’m in her like a free throw
Getting deep throat, at the Fontainebleau
We running trains on these freak hoes
And I told my nigga that I decoded
“Blah blah blah blah”
Quit going in on these niggas
I won’t stop stop stop stop
Keep putting my money over these bitches

Fuck nigga

I’ll show you what’s up nigga
Fuck nigga

Trying to keep it one hunna
And I tried to show love with you
That’s the main reason why I don’t trust niggas (trust)

Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty

[Verse 1]
We'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls

You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra

Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat

Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that

'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back

Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel rod that's so strong,  sends chills up your back
I'm a little more country than that
If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that

They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change.

401,Drop The World,"He won the race
The judges concluded
He was the better man
He'd come from victory

A hesitation
A one time show or place
His self would not allow
He had to be the best

He had denied
His urges cause they would have drained his strength
That battle had been
Won with side effects a few
He may have dropped the world

He would not let us down
Away I hope she's in a better place

She aced the test
A grade above the rest
Of the class felt the curve
A 93% was not enough
To feed her fix
She needs that perfect score

The endorphin rush she loved
It would opiate her

She had denied
All allegations of her loneliness
That battle had been won
With scars still under wraps
She may have dropped the world

She would not let us down

She may have dropped the world",NOFX,2010,"[75, 78, 74, 75, 70, 62, 62, 65, 68, 73, 86, 86, 83, 70, 56, 77, 75, 56, 20, 18]",20

[Intro: Brandy & Monica]
- Excuse me! Can I, please, talk to you for a minute?
- Uh huh. Sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named... You know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely I know his name
- Well, I just want to let you that he's mine
- Huh. No, no. He's mine!

[Chorus: Monica & Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
Think its time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
But see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
See, I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Monica & Brandy]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 2: Monica & Brandy]
Must you do the things you do
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know the boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)

He belongs to me (He belongs to me)

You can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start

403,Lady Is A Tramp,"(Verse)
I've wined and dined on mulligan stew
And never wished for turkey
As I hitched and hiked and drifted, too
From Maine to Albuquerque
Alas, I missed the Beaux Arts Ball
And what is twice as sad
I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca'ad
But social circles spin too fast for me
My hobohemia is the place to be

(Chorus)
I get too hungry for dinner at eight
I like the theater, but never come late
I never bother with people I hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

I don't like crap games with barons and earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Don't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the free, fresh wind in my hair
Life without care
I'm broke
It's oke
Hate California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

(Chorus 2)
I go to Coney, the beach is divine
I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine
I follow Winchell and read every line
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like a prizefight that isn't a fake
I like the rowing on Central Park Lake
I go to opera and stay wide awake
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the green grass under my shoes
What can I lose?
I'm flat
That's that
I'm all alone when I lower my lamp
That's why the lady is a tramp

(Chorus 3)
Don't know the reason for cocktails at five
I don't like flying. I'm glad I'm alive
I crave affection, but not when I drive
That's why the lady is a tramp

Folks go to London and leave me behind
I'll miss the crowning, Queen Mary won't mind
I don't play Scarlett in Gone With the Wind
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like to hang my hat where I please
Sail with the breeze
No dough?
Hi-ho!
I love LaGuardia and think he's a champ
That's why the lady is a tramp

(Chorus 4)
Girls get massages, they cry and they moan
Tell Lizzie Arden to leave me alone
I'm not so hot, but my shape is my own
That's why the lady is a tramp

The food at Sardi's is perfect, no doubt
I wouldn't know what the Ritz is about
I drop a nickel and coffee comes out
That's why the lady is a tramp

I like the sweet, fresh rain in my face
Diamonds and lace
No got
So what?
For Robert Taylor I whistle and stamp
That's why the lady is a tramp",Rodgers & Hart,2010,[81],1
404,I'm Single,"[Verse 1]
Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such
Damn, where is the fucking trust
I'm tired of the hoop and hollering
I'm 'bout to take the coupe to Collins
Then take a female to the Island
Then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas
I'm fucking her friends
Now her friends ain't even fucking with her

Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the night

Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something

And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 3]
Now she got on her fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah, I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your hands up
If you're single, put your-

I'm gonna keep the headphones though

Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No you're not, dude, don't lie
I'm awesome!
I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride
I'm awesome!
A quarter of my life gone by
And I met all my friends online
Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
I will run away from a brawl
I'm awesome!
There's no voice mail, nobody called
I'm awesome!
I can't afford to buy eight balls
And I talk to myself on my Facebook wall

[Verse 1: Spose]
You know my pants sag low (low)
Even though (though) that went out of style
Like ten years ago (go)
Spose, I got the swagger of a cripple
I got little biceps
Getting fatter in the middle
And lyrically I'm not the best
Physically the opposite of Randy Moss, and yet
So preposterous
Feel the awesomeness
The most obnoxious guest up at the sausage fest
Oh yes
The girls are repulsed
So I hide in my hood like I'm joining a cult
I'm as nervous as my cat, ol' Dirty Curtis
All my writtens are bitten and
All my verses are purchased
Me? I'll never date an actress
Got too many back zits
Plus, my whole home aroma is cat piss
Every show I do is poorly promoted
And if you like this
It's cause my little sister wrote it

Motherfucker, I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude, don't lie

The swagger of a cripple

Check it out
I'm from Maine and I don't hunt (nope)
And I can't ski
Smoke weed but I can't roll blunts
Find me whipped by my wifey
My neck not icy
Eatin' at McDonald's because Subway's pricey
Ha, and my uni-brow is plucked
Just asked my mom if I could borrow ten bucks
She's like, ""For what?
Blunt wraps and some Heinekens?
You skinny prick, go get a gym membership and vitamins!""
I'm like, ""Mom please, don't blame it on me
I got my bad habits from you, Dad, and Aunt Steve.""
My attitude's sour but my futon's sweet
And the hair on my ass, it is Jumanji

Can't tweet up on my Twitter

[Verse 3: Spose]
Furthermore I am cornier than Ethanol
Cheesier than Provolone
I spent ages eight to ten living in a motorhome
With a ego the size of Tim Duncan
Even though I got shit for brains like a blumpkin
I'm twenty-four, serving lobster rolls
Because I spent a decade filling Optimos
And I'm not even the bomb in Maine
On my game, I'm only about as sexy as John McCain
Now put your hands up
If you have nightmares
If you wouldn't man up if there was a fight here
If you got dandruff
If you drink light beer
I'm outta breath

But I'm awesome!
No, you're not, dude don't lie

I'm drivin' around in my mom's ride

""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense?
When I got the whole world in front of me?""
So, I said...

I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together

And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

[Chorus 2]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (if you go with me)
For life (see the world with me)

And save me my fistful of tears (save me, save me, save me yeah)

Cause I, I go insane (I go insane baby)
Crazy sometimes (keep me from losing)
Trying to keep you from losing your mind (baby you save me, baby you--)
Open your eyes (open your eyes--)
See what's in front of your face
And save me my fistful of tears (save me my fistful of tears--)

409,All I Ever Wanted,"[Intro]
Def Starz

[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Verse 1: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was to make a fucking difference
Knew a lot that never did it
Tryna be the one who did it
Grew up in the project building
Witnessed dealings and some killings
Devil grinning with how we living
Niggas sinning just to get it
Used to go to bed at night while watching roaches on the ceiling
Taking turns with plates and fork
Because there wasn't enough dishes
Taught to share with all my siblings, If I got it they can get it
I remember watching my OG get high up in the kitchen
I remember finding pipes she hid up in the oven mitten
How I used to throw them out
The ninth floor window like I'm pitching
Then act like I never did it
Thinking that would make her quit it
I still pray to God for healing
If you're real I know you hear me (Ahhhh)

[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Verse 2: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was to make it to the top
Used to look up to my Pops, and all he played was Big and Pac
I figured if I rapped like them well maybe i could get this guap
Put me on TV, I can't see me in no can or in no box
Never thought I had to hussle, never thought I'd tote these Glocks
Never thought I fight them cases, sleeping counties on a cot
Niggas think shit funny til this 40 gets to singing, Jamie Foxx
You beef with me then bodies drop
Boy you dont want to be my opps
And I dont leave no witnesses so can't nobody can tell the cops
Niggas snitching, choppers take them out the picture when I crop
Never planned on popping pussies or nobody getting shot
But I ain't never complain about mine, Nigga you know how I rock

[Hook: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good

[Bridge: Dallas Eli]
All I ever wanted, was to give my people hope
And get their backs up off the ropes
Make my people proud, keep your heads above the clouds
Bought my momma a big ol' house, I just wanna see you smile

[Verse 3: Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted was my OG off of drugs
Used to wash clothes in the tub, Never thought I'd be the plug
All I ever wanted was to make it with this rapping
First I'll trap and get to stacking and invest and make it happen
All I ever wanted to see my niggas shine
Never thought that you would be jealous
You was hating all the time
Had that fuck shit on your mind, don't know how you was designed
But the Lord didn't make me blind, I know how to read them signs

[Hook: Dallas Eli & Montana of 300]
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my family out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see you smile and know you're good
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to get my homies out the hood
All I ever wanted, all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted was to see her smile and know she good",Montana of 300,2010,"[100, 98, 97, 96, 96, 99]",6

Yes, I can see her
'Cause every girl here wanna be her
Oh, she's a diva

They say she low down
It's just a rumor and I don't believe 'em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

[Pre-Chorus: Akon (with David Guetta)]
She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen befo'
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood, hood
I'm tryna find the words to describe this girl without being disrespectful

411,Run Joey Run,"Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Every night, the same old dream
I hate to close my eyes
I can't erase the memory
The sound of Julie's cry

She called me up, late that night
She said, ""Joe, don't come over
My Dad and I just had a fight
And he stormed out the door!

I've never seen him act this way
My God, he's goin' crazy
He said he's gonna make you pay
For what we done
He's got a gun!
So run, Joey run, Joey run!""

Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gonna get married
Just you wait and see

Got in my car
And I drove like mad
'Til I reached Julie's place
She ran to me
With tear-filled eyes and bruises on her face

All at once
I saw him there sneaking up behind me
(Watch out!)
Then Julie yelled, ""He's got a gun!""
And she stepped in front of me

Suddenly, a shot rang out
And I saw Julie falling!
I ran to her
I held her close
When I looked down
My hands were red
And here's the last words Julie said

Daddy, please don't
It wasn't his fault
He means so much to me
Daddy, please don't
We're gon...na get... mar...ried......

412,Ice Ice Baby,"[Intro]
Yo VIP, let's kick it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
""Will it ever stop?"" Yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme, I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
“Did you stop?” No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla
Ice ice baby Vanilla

[Verse 3]
Take heed 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say “Damn!”
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

413,Hillbilly Bone,"[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
Oh man, you've got to watch where you're steppin' around here
Yeah, I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Conway Twitty
Don't know nothin' 'bout grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that's in them genes
Aren’t nothing wrong, just gettin' on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton, Trace Adkins, Both]
Nah, you ain’t gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
Yeah, bubba, all you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you got to let it shine
When it feels so right that it can't be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
You ain't alone, you ain't alone

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin' Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you got to admit that it's in them genes
Ain’t nothin' wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone

[Instrumental]

[Chorus: Blake Shelton & Trace Adkins]
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts bangin' and the fiddle saws
You can't help but a hollerin', Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man, you got to admit that's in them genes

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this

[Verse 1]
My, my, my my music hits me so hard
Makes me say, ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessin' me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

[Chorus]
I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we livin' and ya know (You can't touch this)
Look in my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move outta yo seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rollin', hold on!
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's goin' on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

[Chorus]
Yo, I told you (Can't touch this)
Why you standin' there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school's in, sucka (You can't touch this)

[Verse 3]
Give me a song, or rhythm
Makin' 'em sweat, that's what I'm givin' 'em
Now, they know
You talkin' 'bout the Hammer, you're talkin' 'bout a show
That's hyped, and tight
Singers are sweatin', so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

[Chorus]
That's word because you know (You can't touch this)
(You can't touch this)
Break it down!

[Breakdown]
Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 4]
Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave yo hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump
(Bump, bump, bump)

[Chorus]
Yeah (You can't touch this)
Look, man (You can't touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)
Ring the bell, school's back in

Stop, Hammer time!

You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop, Hammer time!

[Verse 5]
Every time you see me, the Hammer's just so hyped
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doin' this?
With others makin' records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay
It's ""Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer""
And the rest can go and play
You can't touch this

[Chorus]
You can't touch this
You can't touch this
Yeah (You can't touch this)

Too hot (Can't touch this)
Yo, we outta here (Can't touch this)",MC Hammer,2010,[92],1
416,Temporary Home,"[Verse 1]
Little boy, six years old
A little too used to being alone
Another new mom and dad
Another school, another house that will never be home
When people ask him how he likes this place
He looks up and says with a smile upon his face

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is my temporary home

[Verse 2]
Young mom, on her own
She needs a little help, got nowhere to go
She's looking for a job, looking for a way out
'Cause a half-way house will never be a home
At night, she whispers to her baby girl
""Someday we'll find our place here in this world""

[Chorus]
This is our temporary home, it's not where we belong
Windows and rooms that we're passing through
This is just a stop on the way to where we're going
I'm not afraid because I know
This is our temporary home

[Verse 3]
Old man, hospital bed
The room is filled with people he loves
And he whispers, ""Don't cry for me, I'll see you all someday""
He looks up and says, ""I can see God's face""

[Chorus]
This is my temporary home, it's not where I belong
Windows and rooms that I'm passing through
This was just a stop on the way to where I'm going
I'm not afraid because I know
This was my temporary home

When I look at you
When I look at you
When I look at you
When I look at you

When I look at you

[Verse 1: Snypa Issocool]

Jeremy Scott Addidas, I'm flyer than those sneakers
If you love your girlfriend, make sure I don't meet her
Tiger blood in my veins, turn a keeper to a cheetah
If I see her then assume, I left with the 10 digits to reach her
Stiff dick on the bleachers, while you treat the bitch like a diva
I'm so fucking Cole, you thought I was sleeping with Keyshia
Montreal's where I reside, French man, East side
Canada is where I'm at, hate on me I can see why
Nearly lost 5 g'z hoppin' out of that G5
Everybody wasted on that ""White Boy"", it was never cool to be high
My youtube gettin' quick hits, Groupies wanna' lick dick
Facebook full of bitches, cause my bankroll full of digits
So I hit this, dip quick, tryna' set me up with a hickie
So I'm wipin' off all this lip gloss, why the fuck she used all this lip stick?
Those chips you not holdin', talk cheese, you nacho'ing
Hold up my nigga you braggin' but did anybody saw what you got goin'?
Pants sag, I'm not growin', my drawls showin', Ralph Lauren
God knows I ain't rich bitch, but Rick knows that I'm not Owen
I don't really give a shit, motherfuck your feelings bitch
If my shit was that wack, why the fuck you listenin'?
I'm feeling important, my vodka is imported though
If a picture's worth a thousand words, then this night better be recorded
Get drunk as fuck, til' my vision get distorted
Shoutout to my haters man, my skater fans gone support it
In the back of the Accord, dick up in her juice box
Snap back to the back boy, now I feel like 2Pac
I see death around the corner, holler if you hearin' me
Told her what she wanted to hear, and now she sittin' here with me
Right after I get it, I'mma put my team on it
You leased your BM , someone preowned it
Stones in my ears frozed like I dropped it in freon bitch
I'm weirdo yellow diamonds looked like a peed on it
You can beg to differ, but one thing we could agree on
If you think that I ain't dope, you probably on shit
Moet in the presi, baby welcome to the good life
They stuck at the airport, while we already took flight
Worst day of your life let me, turn it to a good night
I stare at my left and she said that I still look right
Put your bets up, man I swear I'm the next up
Ask my momma nigga, put that on everything like ketchup
Niggas trying to catch up, but I'm ahead of them by light years
Living out my dreams, these niggas wake up to a nightmare
Fuck your feelings, swallow your opinion
I don't lose no, no sleep over no women
These niggas be cold grillin' when I enter the premises
Vintage snap back so old make yo grand mama reminisce
What the fuck you think, Mountain Dew up in my drank
Let my money talk for me, that's a statment from the bank",Snypa Issocool,2010,"[94, 91, 68, 52, 27, 16, 25, 58, 57, 81, 79, 96, 88]",13

See me sadness, when me laugh
When me quiet, hear me work
Feel me love and want me bitch
Pull me switch, drag me over
Know me hard when me soft
Know me scared when me talk tough
Go get them guts
Go get them guts
Cut, then cut up your sleeve!
All is useless, it's not real
Feel it all this stress
And give you all emotion or nothing
Explosive expulsion of a bye bye
Say bye-bye!
Expose your emotion over my
And say bye-bye!

[Hook: Elliphant]
All or nothing
Everything or nah
Grey zone is for you to visit and get out of
Reach the bottom of the sky, man

In loneliness you gotta make it, gotta unite
Come, I need you closer, ain't you hearing
My inner wish is passing through the feeling

Ey!
Woman chase me need a man
Love me like you hate me man

Waking up the sleepy land
Move me hard, move me soft
Know me scared when me talk the tough
Unlock the man's head, unlock the man's
Unlock the man's up your head
Words are enough to say
Feelings have no song or flesh
It's a whisper from the red
Say want me fall down, me rise up, up, up, up
Say want me clear, love me good!

[Verse 3: Bunji Galan]
Huh!
We Viking rule like Elliphant
Step into everything relevant
Don't care if you malevolent
Or you may never land
Well it is clear and evident
We roll in like the president
Look pon the whole street
Then see for the resident
And given them democracy
Axes sharp make sure that thing is permanent
Have to get what I have to get
Me don't care if it is hard to get
I come take and then calculate
Then do something immaculate
Look pon de wall
Check pon de right
Listen to tonda
Look at the light
We came here for all or nothing at all
That is the way of the Viking

[Hook: Elliphant]
All or nothing
Everything or nah
Grey zone is for you to visit and get out of
Reach the bottom of the sky, man

No longer the lost
No longer the same
And I can see you starting to break
I'll keep you alive
If you show me the way
Forever and ever
The scars will remain
I'm falling apart
Leave me here forever in the dark

Daylight dies
Blackout the sky
Does anyone care?
Is anybody there?
Take this life
Empty inside
I'm already dead
I'll rise to fall again

God help me, I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun
God help me, I've come undone
Out of the light of the sun

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Haha, Luda!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know

I be like knick, knack, patty, wack
Oh, where my kitty cat?
Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces

422,Beautiful,"[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fuckin' depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—

[Pre-Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes

[Chorus]
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
Then I'm reaching out for you

[Outro]
Yeah, to my babies: stay strong
Daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny
Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful",Eminem,2010,[61],1

Another long summer's come and gone
I don't know why it always ends this way
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides
Are as empty as my broken heart tonight

[Chorus]
But I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you promised you'd be back again
And so I wander 'round this town
'til summer comes around

[Verse 2]
I got a job working at the old park pier
And every summer now for five long years
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks
And I count the days 'tell you just might come back

[Chorus]
But then I close my eyes and one more time
We're spinning around and you're holding' on tightly
The words came out, I kissed your mouth
No Fourth of July has ever burned so brightly
You had to go, I understand
But you swore that you'd be back again
And so I'm frozen in this town
Till summer comes around

[Chorus]
Oh and I close my eyes and you and I
Are stuck on a Ferris wheel rocking with the motion
Hand in hand we cried and laughed
Knowing that love belonged to us girl, if only for a moment
And ""Baby I'll be back again"" you whispered in my ear
But now the winter wind is the only sound
And everything is closing down
'til summer comes around

Nothing I can say
Done running from this pain in my way
I'm fighting every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, ""Okay""
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

430,New Morning,"[Verse 1]
One morn I awakened
A new sun was rising
The sky was a Kingdom
All covered in blood
The moon and the stars
Where the troops that lay conquered
Like fruit left to wither
Poor spiritual food

[Verse 2]
And the spears of the bright sun
All brave with its conquest
Did hover unearthly
With banners of fire
I knelt in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes

[Verse 3]
Thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood
Let there be no sadness
No sorrow
Let there be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
Oh yes it's today
For us

I thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood

Oh yes it's today
For us",Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,2010,[100],1
431,According To You,"Spring comes like a kiss upon the mouth
Soft and sweet with all the power of the earth behind
Broken fever and soaking sheets
Twisted round our bodies in the cool of the morning
Turning the cards over one by one
I see the faces staring back from across the ages
And everything tastes so strong, so strong
But you could never sense because
According to you
There isn't anything left to believe in
Because you never could see
That there is everything that we are receiving
We joined the battle between right and wrong
When we were all so young and certain
And now we pass the passions on
In the broken light streaming through the shredded curtain
They bring you scapegoats to sacrifice
Anything or anybody just to nail your pain to
They bring you promises you know are lies
So you feel betrayed in everything that you cling to so
According to you
There isn't anything left to believe in
Because you never could see
That there is everything that we are receiving
Come back to us all

432,Heartbreak Warfare,"[Verse 1]
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Verse [2]
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Chorus]
If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

[Verse 3]
How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all

[Bridge]
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down

[Chorus]
Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again

Disappointment has a name

So letting go ain't easy
I'm hanging on but growing cold
While my mind is leaving

Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep
Because I'm halfway gone, and I'm on my way
And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long
Because I'm halfway gone, I'm halfway gone
Halfway gone, I'm halfway gone

[Verse 2]
You got one foot out the door
And choking on the other
Always think there's something more
Is just around the corner

Talk, talk is cheap
Give me your word you can keep

And I'm feeling, feeling, feeling this way
Because you're halfway in, but don't take too long

I am a god
Even though I'm a man of God
My whole life in the hand of God
So y'all better quit playin' with God

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning

[Chorus]
I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AHH!
AHH!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, ""What up, Yeezus?""
I said, ""Shit—I'm chillin'
Tryna stack these millions""
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's our cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god

444,Hello,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore

Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

445,Hello Goodbye,"[Verse 1: Erik Segerstedt]
Hello, goodbye, you were perfect
But now that the sun's coming out we're through
Your body and mine, empty bottles of wine
And the memories are chasing clues

Let's not make things complicated
We're better off seperated

[Chorus 1: Erik Segerstedt]
'Cause now we're sober, it's all over
Don't push your luck and ask if you could stay
There's nothing more I need, just go away
Just go away

Hello, goodbye, you were perfect last night
But this bed isn't made for two
You said please stay the night, I could be mr. right
For a second that line felt true

Let's not make things complicated
We're better off seperated

[Chorus 2: Tone Damli]
'Cause now we're sober, it's all over
And nothing that you say will sound okay
I'll pack my things there ain't no other way
Now we're sober, don't come closer
Don't push your luck and ask if I could stay
There's nothing more I need, I'll go away

[Bridge: Both]
We could do this all again
We should enjoy it while we can
Call me whenever you feel alone
And I will take you home
But then you're on your own, 'cause

Hello goodbye, you were perfect
But now that the sun's coming out we're through

[Chorus 3: Both]
Now we're sober, it's all over
'Cause every now and then I need to play
With you the game gets better every day
Now we're sober, don't come closer

446,Life After You,"[Verse 1]
Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know

[Chorus 1]
Believe me, I won't stop at nothin'
To see you, so I've started runnin'

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

[Verse 2]
Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time

[Chorus 1]
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

[Bridge]
You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

[Chorus 1]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you, God knows what I'd do, yeah

[Chorus 2]
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinking that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through, yeah

Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long

Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?

And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless

You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

452,That's How Country Boys Roll,"[Verse 1]
They wake up in the morning and they drink their coffee black
They love their woman one beat shy of a heart attack
On the way to work they might stop by a fishing hole
That's how country boys roll
Yeah, they work, work, work, all week til the job gets done
Weekends they bar-b-que and have a cold one
They run on a big ol' heart and a pinch of Skoal
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

[Verse 2]
Well if you don't know your way around
They'll draw you a map
And if you're broke and you ask
They'll give you the shirt off their back
All they need is a little gas
A few dollars to fold
That's how country boys roll

[Chorus]
Yeah, they're spinning their wheels
Casting their reels
Way back on them all county roads
Singing in bars
Souping their cars just to see how fast they'll go
From a ball and glove to them falling in love
They do everything heart and soul
That's how country boys roll

Aw come on now
Yeah they're crying aloud
Humble and proud
They love moma and Jesus and Jones

Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall

Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night

Don't let me fall, don't let me fall

And he'll never know your story like I do

Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me

I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doin' with a dick like that?

Oh
La, la, la, la, la
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
I know it might be crazy
But did you hear the story?
I think I heard it vaguely
A girl and a zombie
Oh, tell me more, boy
Yeah
Sounds like a fantasy
Oh, what could go so wrong
With a girl and a zombie
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darker side
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me
Right from the start you caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh, I've got a feeling
If you get to know me

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side
Yeah, yeah

We're gonna be someday
We're gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We're gonna be someday

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Girl, you look delicious
Oh, I mean gorgeous
Well, now you're getting fearless
No, I'm just rooting for us
If different was a super power
We'd be so flawless
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours
I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark
Imagine it now they start a spark
You got my attention
What happens next, then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we want
I like the way you're thinking
I can almost see it

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both]
Someday
This could be, this could be ordinary
Someday
Could we be something extraordinary?

463,Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart,"[Intro]
Let's do it, baby, let's do it, baby
Let's do it, do it

[Verse 1]
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the time you were tellin' me lies

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Post-Chorus]
Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

[Verse 2]
Lonely, only nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end
Oh

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

[Bridge]
Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love
And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

[Chorus]
So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

464,One Day,"[Verse 1]
She stares at her ceiling once again with a hundred thoughts
""Maybe he knows who I am; probably not""
She walks down the hall with her head down low, scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice she's swarmed with butterflies

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Verse 2]
He always walks the crowded halls and is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low and never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice she runs away

[Chorus]
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside

[Bridge]
One day maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day she'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking, she'll call him mine
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day he'll look into her eyes
And say that, ""You're my only light""

[Chorus]
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I understand that you will never be mine
And that's fine, I'm just breaking inside",Tate McRae,2010,"[94, 85, 90, 89, 93, 90]",6

466,Why Don't We Just Dance,"[Verse 1]
Baby why don't we just turn that TV off?
Three hundred fifteen channels
Of nothing but bad news on
Well, it might be me, but the way I see it
The whole wide world has gone crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?
Guess the little bitty living room ain't going to look like much
When the lights go down and we move the couch
It's going to be more than enough
For my two left feet and our two hearts beating
Nobody's going to see us go crazy
So baby, why don't we just dance?

[Chorus]
Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air
Baby, why don't we just dance?

[Verse 2]
Baby, why don't you go put your best dress on?
Those high heeled shoes you love to lose
As soon as the tunes come on
On second thought, just the way you are
Is already driving me crazy

Down the hall, maybe straight up the stairs
Bouncing off the wall, floating on air

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (Said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre

That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep

I just didn't know what to do (I just didn't know what to do)

So baby, whatcha say

Mmmm, whatcha say
Mmmm, that you only meant well? (Well of course I did, baby)
Well of course you did
Mmmm, whatcha say (whatcha say, whatcha say)

473,Do You Remember,"[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Kanye West]
Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Uhm—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, ""Spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet""
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Scary, scary
No more parties in L.A.
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A.

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A 38-year-old 8-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)!
Big, big money (Money, money, money!)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker!

You gotta think
I make a lot of music about the struggle
I don't mind goin' through the struggle
This just another one, ya heard me
(Say Kevin bruh, man what the fuck I'm hearin'?)
I will not be disrespected
(What's goin' on out there?)
Nigga or bitch
(Damn bruh you dropped the ball)

Go to jail who gonna look out for your daughter
All on the news bout what happened in Florida
Posted on Worldstar a iPhone recorded
She grabbed my dick overreacted, I'm sorry
Two or three times I had already warned her
Edit that part out, I don't Like to argue
My children go with me to every performance

[Interlude]
Wrong you should have respect for yourself
You a queen and you wasn't respectin' yourself
Ever been disrespected, you know how it felt
You don't have to like me go love someone else

[Verse 2]
Father forgive me I fucked up a blessin'
When ever I fall you the only one to catch me
Let's change the subject, I gave a confession
You put me back in it I bet I go extra

[Interlude]
Wrong you should have respect for yourself
You a queen and you wasn't respectin' yourself
Ever been disrespected, you know how it felt
You don't have to like me go love someone else

[Verse 3]
SauceLord Rich way they got me feelin'
I don't get tired, I got ten jobs
I am Zuse bumpin' Lito when I'm chillin'
I'ma Breadwinner that is my religion
Don't comment on twitter let you know I meant it
I might like her picture
I'm like nigga really?
I'm like Bobby Fischer eat my competition
I'm ready to die, you gone have to kill me
With you right or wrong, don't believe in switchin'
Nasty from the shoulders watch how I switch positions
Put him in a blender my heart been December
Put him in a spitter, can't be reassembled
I'm a real nigga, really made mistakes
Never ran away, I am not pretendin'
High school back when I was at McKinley
I still fuck with Scooby, shout out to lil Brittney
Stayed with black guys, niggas always pickin' on a bright nigga
I am really with it
Damn my homeboy always in his feelin's
This ain't bout him, I'm just reminiscin'
He was crackin' jokes, always bein' silly
I was doin' me fuck a public image
Passionate I can be extra sometimes
Brasi turn back into Kevin sometimes
Ain't right in the head, look back up in jail
Lord don't let us get put back in the cell
Washin' clothes in the toilet water (Damn)
Drinkin' out the faucet had to use your hands
Gunna on the phone ""They got you lookin' bad""
For a punt return they gone run it back
Deal with it, Kevin stand up in they chest
This the same girl was pullin' out her breast
Got her mother lyin' tryna get a check
Remember who you are, they envy your success
Diamonds in your mouth all around your neck
Black and Hispanic the worst you could be
I think to myself they must hate Puerto Ricans
Father Moroccan my mother Boriqua
Daddy a Muslim, my mother a Christian
I read from the book, a lot I don't remember
Santeria beads Karma comes along
Now they want me gone like I'm Farrakhan
Praise you when you up, kick you when you fall
Throw you to the vultures, sniper pick you off
In a court of law brought you to the floor
All my young rappers they kept it one million
Learn from my misfortune don't get in your feelin's
Be an individual you go to prison
I just took a stand with my saggin' pants
I just tell the truth like I'm Jesus Christ
Meant to say Jesus
I'm who they don't like
I'ma move around I don't like the vibe

Don't you run when you hear the sirens coming
When you hear the sirens coming
You better not run 'cause the sirens not coming for you
What have you done?
You went to school that day
Was a bit late but it was a Monday
Kept after class for answering back
You apologized, ain't no harm in that

Gun crime into your right ear
Drugs and violence into your left

Subconscious waves you accept

Pause the poison to answer his message
Your boy sounds rushed, fears for his adolescence

Tall black shadow as you're getting off the bus
Shadow shows no emotion so what's even the fuss?
But the face of your boy casts a darker picture
Of the red handed act, he's gonna whisper;
""Look blud I'm sorry 'cause I know you got my back
He was running, I couldn't think, I had to get out of that""
Not long ago you were miming to the ""Shook Ones""
Now this really is part two 'cause you're the shook one
Hands you the tool as you question your friendship
How's man like you gonna make me a convict?
Level of a felon when I've done nothing wrong
Blood on my hands but I don't know where it's from, oh
You got blood on your hands but you don't know where it's from

When you hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming

The blue lights are coming for you

But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing

I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one

And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
Yeah, yeah

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey (Hey, hey)

Never, think just for shits and giggles
Do we spit syllable riddles for bits and kibbles
So chicks can wiggle and shake
Cuz this image is fake

[Verse 2: Akil]
I’m trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

[Verse 3: Soup]
Some brothers debate some love and some hate
Whatever the case its all about the choices you make
That’s the reason you balloon'll deflate

[Verse 4: Chali 2na]
But do beleive we trying to rap back to its primitive state
Wait

[Verse 5: Marc 7even]
No overnight success or running with vets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I’m willing to bet the farm you’ll give you right arm
For a piece of the pie ask yourself why

[Hook: All]
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to

From the soul comes something amazing

How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain’t payin my bills
Or feeding my kids, judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

[Verse 11: Marc 7even]
Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you’re a star
Why you frontin’ (you ain’t nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing
If your people still wanting

[Verse 12: Chali 2na]
And you got money ain’t givin’ them nothing

[Verse 13: All]
Flossin and frontin

[Verse 14: Soup]
Your game of charades
The way you behave
The image you save
Your brother thats one big parade
I’m sick of your ways

The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with the gays

Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days

He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl,  you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself

494,Follow Me Down,"[Verse 1]
Since I met you I've been crazy
Since I've been with you I've been lost
You make everything seem so hazy
Love comes with such a cost

Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

[Chorus]
Follow me down to the river
Drink while the water is clean
Follow me down to the river tonight
I'll be down here on my knees
So follow me down to the river
Follow me down through the trees
Follow me down to the river, man
I'll be down here on my knees
I'll be down here on my knees

[Verse 2]
Nights avoiding things unholy
Your hand slips across my skin
I go down on you so slowly
Don't confess none of your sins

Have I lost my mind?
Have I lost my mind?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When you're young you always take what you can get
Even bicycles and sprinklers get you wet
Now I know that there's a different way to die

Heart still beats
But I am not alive

[Intro: Drake]
Hey, oh-oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong
Got this little song for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus: Drake]
Shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it down, down, down
You would shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round
And they'd notice, they'd notice
You would shut it—

Girl you're the greatest
And if he say you ain't, girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
And if he say you ain't, that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, every time you come around
Shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
And let me put you in the Louboutins
What you want, what you need
I can be your everything
Them other niggas just wanna hit it
But if they had it, wouldn't know what to do with it

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream]
And together we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
You'd be the baddest girl around, round, round

That we shut it down, down, down
They know we shut it down, down, down
Every time we come around, round, round
And they'd notice (they'd know) they'd notice

TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down, down
Ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down, down

[Verse 3: Drake]
Shooting stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut 'em down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves, the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
But she don't have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found the one?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn, I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around, it's obvious—

[Chorus: Drake & The-Dream]
You shut that thing down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down (down, down, down)
You shut it down, you shut it down

[Verse 4: Drake]
The way I’m feeling, the things I say
All just happen when you pass my way
What can I do to make you stay?
I know it’s getting late, but girl I don’t want you to leave
You tell me you’re just not the type, you wanna do this right
And I’m not trying to say I don’t believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people?
Take those fucking heels off, it’s worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off, I swear you won’t forget me
You’ll be happy that you let me

We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out, I
I didn't come here to hurt you
Now I can't stop

I want you to know that it doesn't matter
Where we take this road, but someone's gotta go
And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
It started with a perfect kiss then we could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

You know that I love you so
I love you enough to let you go

I want you to know that it doesn't matter

It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, mane, ever, mane, ever, mane

[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothin' to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city, faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club, you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a countrywide tour'd be the outcome?
Labels want my name beside a X, like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga, I'm about my business
Killin' all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is askin' for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches

Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the buildin'
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button, ""What?"" nothin'
Now it's super bad chicks givin' me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack?
Chasin' the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back

Okay, hello, it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fuckin' roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm restin' in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleepin' on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh

[Chorus: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin' if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waitin' patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as befo'
Bashin' in the brains of these hoes
And establishin' a name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talkin' about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth-spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it
Payback, motherfucker
For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinkin' of savin' face
You ain't gonna have no face to save

I'm going to miss that smile
I'm going to miss you my friend

503,White Liar,"[Chorus]
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

[Verse 1]
You better be careful what you do
I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes
If they ever found you out
You better be careful what you say
It never really added up any way
I got friends in this town

[Chorus]
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

[Verse 2]
You said you went out to a bar
And walked some lady to her car
But your face has more to tell
'Cause my cousin saw you on the street
With a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don't lie too well

[Chorus]
Hey, white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire
Slips off of your tongue like turpentine
And I don't know why, white liar

[Bridge]
Here's a bombshell just for you
Turns out I've been lyin' too

[Chorus]
Now I'm a white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
And it spreads just like a fire

506,Rain,"[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

507,Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You,"[Verse 1]
I remember the way you made love to me
Like I was all you'd ever need
Did you change your mind?
Well, I didn't change mine
Now here I am trying to make sense of it all
We were best friends, now we don't even talk
You broke my heart
Ripped my world apart

[Chorus]
Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?

[Verse 2]
I can't get you out of my head
I still feel you in this bed
Left me all alone
You couldn't be more gone
From falling apart to fighting mad
From wanting you back to not giving a damn
I've felt it all
I've been to the wall

[Chorus]
Didn't you know how much I loved you?
Didn't you know how much I loved you, baby?
I gave you everything, every part of me
Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?

One day justice will come and find you
And I'll be right there in your memory to remind you

Didn't you feel it when I touched you?
Didn't I rock you when I loved you, baby?
Baby, tell me
Didn't you know how much I loved you?

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)

This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick

Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town""
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

Too much pressure and I'm nervous

And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact

And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well faith was strong but you needed proof
Y'saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
Well she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and cut your hair
And from your lips she drew Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
Seen this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I saw your flag on the marble arch
Our love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin

My jaw drops, you fell from the stars, and I'm starstruck

Let's fuck until we slump over

She told you, we need each other
Hah, what if she trippin? I'm just kiddin'
Back to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous

Of distant dark places

The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up

Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

Pretty girls is my reputation
One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners

528,Consider Me Gone,"[Verse 1]
Every time I turn the conversation
To something deeper than the weather
I can feel you always shutting down
And when I need an explanation for the silence
You just tell me you don't want to talk about it now
What you're not saying is coming in loud and clear
We're at a crossroads here

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Verse 2]
With you, I've always been wide open, like a window or an ocean
There is nothing I've ever tried to hide
So when you leave me not knowing where you're going
I start thinking that we're looking, we're looking at goodbye
How about a strong shot of honesty?
Don't you owe that to me?

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
If you don't get drunk on my kiss
If you think you can do better than this
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

[Bridge]
Consider me a memory
Consider me the past
Consider me a smile in an old photograph
Someone who used to make you laugh

[Chorus]
If I'm not the one thing you can't stand to lose
If I'm not that arrow to the heart of you
Then I guess we're done
Let's not drag this on
Consider me gone

The ship is waiting
All systems are go
""Are you sure?""
Control is not convinced

Has the evidence
No need to abort

Watching in a trance

All is working

He's alive
No one understands
But Major Tom sees
""Now the light commands
This is my home

Wait until I know you better

Our condolences as you fightin' against this
We’re right by your side while we tryin' to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that's left, accept them into your garden
So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin'
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So let's get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them 'til they get strong again

So we know we just can’t rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon' catch a break, my friend lost his mother, and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that
Nah, not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us

On a cold dark ground
And the rain is falling down
The church doors thrown open
I can hear the organ's song
But the congregation's gone

My city of ruins
My city of ruins

Drifting through the evening trees
Young men on the corner
Like scattered leaves
The boarded up windows
The empty streets
While my brother's down on his knees

My city of ruins
My city of ruins

Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!
Come on rise up!

Now there's tears on the pillow
Darling where we slept
And you took my heart when you left
Without your sweet kiss
My soul, is lost my friend
Now tell me how do I begin again?

Pray for the love Lord

I said, ""Hey girl, what's your name?
Haven't I seen you before?
I recognize them dark green eyes
When you do-si-doed across the floor""
""Are you alone, or are you with someone?""
She said, ""As a matter of fact I'm not""
So I took her hand, that's when it all began
And we headed towards the parking lot

[Chorus - Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I have not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

[Verse 2 -Jake Owen]
We went riding around rocking to the sound
Of ""A Country Boy Can Survive""
And I knew then she was my kindof a girl
Cause she was singing every single line
Then she slid on over put my hand on her shoulder
And I asked her what she wanted to do
She said, ""It really don't matter where we go
Just as long as I'm riding with you""

[Chorus-Jake Owen]
And she said, ""Hey boy, do you mind
Taking me home tonight?
Because I am not never seen a country boy
With tires on his truck this high""
I said, ""Climb on up, but honey watch the cup
That I'm spittting my dip inside
And hold on tight cause it's going to be wilder
Than any eight second ride""

So we headed out to Old Tobacco Road
Put the tailgate down and we made love
She said ""A true country boy is hard to find

540,Fifteen,"[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

Another packaged lie to keep us trapped in greed
And all the green belts wrapped around our minds

Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I’m too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you’d stay

Fall

[Verse 1]
Now the dark begins to rise
Save your breath, it's far from over
Leave the lost and dead behind
Now's your chance to run for cover
I don't want to change the world
I just want to leave it colder
Light the fuse and burn it up
Take the path that leads to nowhere
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

Fall

[Verse 2]
Watch the end through dying eyes
Now the dark is taking over
Show me where forever dies
Take the fall and run to heaven
All is lost again, but I'm not giving in

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change
And I am not proud, cold blooded fate
I will shut the world away

I will not!

[Chorus]
I will not bow, I will not break
I will shut the world away
I will not fall, I will not fade
I will take your breath away

And I'll survive, paranoid
I have lost the will to change

I'm all messed up
I'm messy, I'm messy
I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
Walk into the room with my skirt tucked into my shoes (my shoes)
I skated here, I'm sweating, had a good day how about you (it was alright)
Let's talk about things, Dan, game plan
Hey Stan, why you talking over me? (ah)
Chatting shit, I'm not a kid, well this is patronizing
Then explain how you studied this at Uni so you'd know (mhm)
More than me about the thing that paid for my phone (yeah)
Why don't you make it a hat trick and comment on my look
Like ""Bit outlandish, love, but you know, don't judge a book""
(Don't judge it)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I don't know who you think I am
But your bitch is not one
I'm good at what I do
And don't ever let anyone
Tell me that your song's okay
But sweetie did you know
A couple changes here and there would make it super cool
(It would be so awesome, like so much better)

[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess
Cause I say what I like and what I hate

I'm all messed up
I'm messy as a boy
And I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Don't you think she'd look a little bit nicer if she combed her hair every once in a while, aha
Look at those jeans, so messy, jeez
You know what, her natural hair colour would look so much better on her with her bone structure
She probably doesn't even write her own songs, hahahaha
Open up my mouth and rap some fiction poems prose
But all that you can focus on is my makeup and clothes
I don't have perfect skin, I don't live in fairytale land (La la la)
Stop telling me to grow some balls, I'm happy as a woman

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Also on that subject maybe you should change your look
Your presentation's scruffy and it's time you really took
This whole thing seriously, do you really want success?
Just cause I'm a girl I think that you think you know best
(Well let's be honest, I do)

[Chorus]
They say I'm a hot mess
I don't care what they say
They say I'm a hot mess
Cause I know what I'm doing
Guess I'm just a hot mess

How the world works, I'm female you see
Please stop using such big words
My brain can't take it
I'm just a little girly

I don't know how deep to go
But I'ma let it all out so come peep the show
Got my first Xanny of my mate, I ain't gonna say his name
It was fun at the start, I used to treat it like a game
This around the time when The Nebulizer dropped
I was on all types of shit, but there’s one I couldn’t stop
And it played with my brain, but I focused on the music
I focused so much, didn't realize I abused it
Never had a plan to stop, not in that prediction
Going through fame, couldn’t see I had addictions
One turned to two, turned to three, turned to four
Then I need about six a day, a little bit more
Mixing it with lean, gotta stop people seeing
What damages can be by looking at me, shit
What to do cause I feel like a fool
And I hate any rapper making Xannies look cool
Shit was getting bad I was filled up with hateful
Thoughts in my mind, I would argue with April
Agreed I would stop, shit I'd give it a go
By the first fucking night, felt like slitting my throat
Second night, my body shaking
The ambulance appear and I'm thinking in my mind, what the fuck they doing here?
Suddenly I'm caught up and there's no time to muck round
Lucky I got here, cause my body 'bout to shut down

[Verse 2]
Back to square one, nah man you can't quit
You gotta wean yourself off, that's some hard shit
What the fuck man, my brain is a mess
I can't remember that much, feel the pain in my legs
I wish it was that easy, I could give up and go
And people still got the hide to tell me pick up my phone
Maybe that's my fault, I didn't speak on it much
I didn't see if as a problem, I would keep it from cunts
Rates could always tell, when I couldn't pronounce certain words, brain dead
Yeah should I be proud?
Anxiety was killing me, the doctors couldn't deal with me
Put me on a program cut me down on the pills and weed
All scared, cause I feel on my own
I told ‘em “let me chill’, now they think I'm dissing them bro
Waking up tired, I gotta take more pills
And I didn’t even wanna take ‘em, is this fucking for real?
Losing touch of myself, it's like reality's false
It's like I’m walking around without having a pulse
It's a feeling of death, or like nothing is left
'Cause there I'm holding my chest, just put a hole in my head
You see the older I get, It's getting scary as fuck
I'm like an eighteen in the head, I weren’t aware of those drugs
The shit that they 'cause, I talk to mirrors on walls
I don't need this shit ever, but to pills I will fall

[Verse 3]
I opened up on ‘No Rest’ told cunts everything
That I done ice, didn't leave out anything
I quit that shit, yeah I left it flat dead
That was 5 years ago, they still think I'm a crackhead
If that's what we going off, fuck me dead
In 5 years I'll be clean, they'll be calling me a Xanny head
Funny how the world works for a paycheck
Once the fame hit, I became a train wreck
I wasn’t shit anyway, so why does it count?
Why so many people love me? I can't figure it out
But I'm telling you now, don't you follow my path
Look you couldn’t if you tried, 'cause I'm going in hard
Fuck a poppin' a pill, just to go out today
How'd I end up like this? I don't know, it's a way
Well I'm blaming the fame, yeah I said it before
But it's enough to make me high, feel like ending it all, but I

[Verse 4]
Brush it off got my fans on my side too, and my girl and my brothers
And the whole crew
Spilling the truth, it's like all I can do
That's why I don't have time for rappers that are saying they're true
When they lie to their fans, apologize in the end
I never lied to mine and this is why I’m the man
I tell you what I'm going through, I don’t care what they think
That's why I'm triple popping pills, leaning over the sink
I'm almost fuckin' crying as I’m writing this shit
'Cause of all my close ones, and the lives I affect
I came from the bottom, I made it my problem
Created the option, now fame has adopting
My brain gotta stop it, insane I am not this
Strange we got Scott sick, I'ma watch a clock tick
Just fuck off, I said it just fuck off
If I won’t have my tablets I’ll find a bridge to jump off
Fucking idiots, thinking that the shit is cool
‘Till they dyin’ in the vomit of there own drool
What I meant to say? Don’t do what I done
I've cut down on the program, yeah I’ve won
Repped it from the street, turned into a star then
Caught a fucking habit on the Xanex but the bars went
Crazy and I'm just dealing with fame
I just want my fans to know that I’ll still be the same. I'm good",Kerser,2010,"[99, 83]",2
559,Run This Town,"[Produced by Kanye West & No I.D]

[Intro: Rihanna]
Feel it comin' in the air
Hear the screams from everywhere
I’m addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair
Can’t be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
We gon' run this town!

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row

[Hook: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care

Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

[Outro: Jay Z & Rihanna]
Whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Yeah, yeah, whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy

560,Funhouse,"[Verse 1]
I dance around this empty house
Tear us down, throw you out
Screaming down the halls
Spinnin' all around and now we fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Pictures framing up the past
You're taunting smirk behind the glass
This museum full of ash
Once a tickle, now a rash

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun!

[Verse 2]
Echoes knockin' on locked doors
All the laughter from before
I'd rather live out on the street
Than in this haunted memory

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've called the movers
Called the maids
We'll try to exorcise this place
Drag my mattress to the yard
Crumble, tumble, house of cards

[Chorus]
This used to be our funhouse
But now it's full of evil clowns
It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
This used to be our funhouse

It's time to start the countdown
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down
I'm gonna burn it down

Oh
I'm crawling through the doggy door
My key don't fit my lock no more
I'll change the drapes
I'll break the plates
I'll find a new place
Burn this fucker down

Do, do, do, do, do, do, do

562,Gettin' You Home,"[Verse 1]
Tuxedo waiters, black tie
White table clothes and red wine
We've been planning, this night
Looking forward to it for some time
Now honey I know you love getting dressed up
And you know I love showing you off
But watching your baby blue eyes
Dancing in the candle light glow
All I can think about, is getting you home

[Chorus]
Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home

[Verse 2]
I don't need this menu, no I don't
I already know just what I want
Did I hear you right, did you tell me
Go pay the waiter and lets leave
Now honey I know by that look in your eyes
And your hand drawing hearts on mine
That our night out of the house
Ain't gonna last too long
When all you can think about, is getting me home

[Chorus]
Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about is getting you home

Walking through the front door
Seeing your black dress hit the floor
Uh honey there sure ain't nothing
Like you loving me all night long
And all I can think about, all I can think about
All I can think about is getting you home",Chris Young,2010,"[94, 92]",2
563,(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To,"[Verse 1]
The moon was shining on the lake at night
The Slayer T-shirt fit the scene just right
Through smeared mascara
I looked into your eyes and saw a light

[Verse 2]
You told me stories about your chickadees
They didn’t like BB guns or stupid archery
You charmed the lifeguard
He let them use the pool all day for free

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped
And I looked down at my feet
I was next to you and you were right there next to me
Then I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you’re wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
So make the move (make the move)
Cause I ain’t got all night

[Verse 3]
The rest of the summer was the best we’ve ever had
We watched Titanic and it didn’t make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

[Verse 4]
Your mom cooked meatloaf, even though I don’t eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

[Pre-Chorus]
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me
And I said

[Chorus]
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue

[Bridge]
So much pain may come our way
There may come a day when we have nothing left to say
When the conversation stops and we’re facing our defeat
I’ll be next to you and you’ll be right there next to me
Then I’ll say

[Chorus]
Girl, if you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to)
I want you to
I swear it's true
Without you, my heart is blue",Weezer,2010,"[100, 95]",2
564,Music Box,"[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like ""Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula""
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me

Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

I hear my music box playing a song for me

Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch

Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like ""nigga"" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, ""grrr"", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
""Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

[Chorus]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, ""First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Ow""
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' ""What the fuck is up?"" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch",Childish Gambino,2010,"[95, 76]",2

569,Kings And Queens,"[Intro: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless
Five girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that R8 then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed-ed, cross-sign baptism, West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head on
I'm too strong, eight arms, ticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks so I hope it open every door

[Chorus: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, young...

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uhh, never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death
We ain't cool with all of these niggas, I'm through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas, you lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young'un will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king but I’m way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches
Double MG, YMCMB cause we run this, you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around, I am Charles Sheen
Ralph...

[Chorus: Tyga]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream

[Verse 3: Nas]
Uhh.. yeah, yeah
You're in the presence of a majestic, esoteric
Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest cause I come from where metal spit
Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip
Won't pop another pill, can't drink another sip
Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips
A white Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz
That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang
Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything
Escobar season begins so let the semis ring
Pimp of the year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk

570,Hell Breaks Loose,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups?
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER, we are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow, no, not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy, girl, you just hit the lottery

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
This is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, this song’s like a seance, it haunts
It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance
It's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what? Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing, stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah, man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But, homie, just mark my words
I'm murderin' the flow, liquid courage, I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door, power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking, it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it, freak, move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there?
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT, yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hatin' on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us, you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink no matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems, we're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose",Eminem,2010,[29],1

Ooooh, New York!
Ooooh, New York!

[Verse 1]
Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

[Hook 1]
Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!

[Verse 2]
On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

[Hook 2]
I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

All aboard!
Okay, next stop, my basement (Ha-ha)
I'll meet you down there!

[Chorus]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He'd say, ""What if you went platinum?"", I'd just laugh at him
""That's not happening, that I can't fathom""
Eighty-some million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touché me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Whoopsa-that-a-fucking-daisy
That’s a no-no, even she knows Da-Da's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cuckoo, bananas, fucking-A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's 'cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen, man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted 'cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters, turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I oughta just be honest, but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day, when I met Dre

""Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots""
All these fucking voices in my head, I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason, slash, Leatherface, and
Together makes 'em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the Wiener Schnitzel up his ass, hopped away, some-
-body please stop the patient, get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the Scheiße, ask Doctor Dreson
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away, son
No, not a-now, not a chance, not today, son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stain, feck it
I'll just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

Elevator in my house, hah, smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in the microwave, I'm
Thinking 'bout an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbors step away, then I just pepper-sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hide out, drive by my house and beep
Like, now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker (bah), try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out why now there's beef
Mace in your face, bitch, cry now, pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above 'em just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement, yelling ""Stop!""

573,On Fire,"[Intro]
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know, the one thing I notice about critics, man
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'ma tell 'em

[Verse 1]
Augh, yesterday my dog died
I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said: ""Next time you blog, try to spit a flow.""
You wanna criticize, dog? Try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up, so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter, here I go
Flows tighter, hot-headed as Ghost Rider
Cold-hearted as Spider-Man throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires, in a hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen, dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf, this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds, this is the salt, so get lost
Shit, dissin' me is just like pissin' off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze
Beat you in the jaws with it, grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers, gizzards, and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in a blizzard with Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him, and visit his dog

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so fuckin' sick
I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire)
(You're on fire)

[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long-ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look, this ain't a song
It's a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over, so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, you're a fuckin' flash in the pan
I pop up, you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man, yeah, I'm pissed
But I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything, metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fuckin' chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun, man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon
Fuck it, I ain't playin', pull up in a van
And hop out on a homeless man holding a sign sayin'
""Vietnam vet"", I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him nine grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage, you ain't never seen a brute
You wanna get graphic, we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut poop
Sayin' you sick, quit playin', you prick, don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one, 'cause ain't nobody there
And nobody will fuckin' test me
'Cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines, but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Nah, don't waste it, save it, psycho—yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines
That you said about Michael's hair (Woops!)

[Chorus]
(You're on fire) That's how you know you're on a roll
'Cause when you're hot it's like you're burning up everyone else's cold
(You're on fire) Man, I'm so hot
My motherfuckin' firetruck's on fire, homie
(You're on fire) You need to stop, drop, and roll
'Cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip-hop shop to blow
(You're on fire) Yeah

In the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
My whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind, make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
