Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

[Chorus: All & Mariah Carey]
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (Together)
One sweet day

[Verse 3: Boyz II Men & (Mariah Carey)]
Darling, I never showed you (No, no, no, no)
Assumed you'd always be there (Always there)
I thought you'd always be there
I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (But I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared (Yeah, and I know)

[Chorus: All, Mariah Carey]
And I know you're shining down on me from Heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way (Lost along the way)

1,"Exhale (Shoop Shoop) (From ""Waiting To Exhale"")","LETTER V

Had I determined to travel in Sweden merely for pleasure, I should probably have chosen the road to Stockholm, though convinced, by repeated observation, that the manners of a people are best discriminated in the country.  The inhabitants of the capital are of the same genus; for the varieties in the species we must, therefore, search where the habitations of men are so separated as to allow the difference of climate to have its natural effect.  And with this difference we are, perhaps, most forcibly struck at the first view, just as we form an estimate of the leading traits of a character at the first glance, of which intimacy afterwards makes us almost lose sight.

As my affairs called me to Stromstad (the frontier town of Sweden) in my way to Norway, I was to pass over, I heard, the most uncultivated part of the country.  Still I believe that the grand features of Sweden are the same everywhere, and it is only the grand features that admit of description.  There is an individuality in every prospect, which remains in the memory as forcibly depicted as the particular features that have arrested our attention; yet we cannot find words to discriminate that individuality so as to enable a stranger to say, this is the face, that the view.  We may amuse by setting the imagination to work; but we cannot store the memory with a fact.

As I wish to give you a general idea of this country, I shall continue in my desultory manner to make such observations and reflections as the circumstances draw forth, without losing time, by endeavouring to arrange them.

Travelling in Sweden is very cheap, and even commodious, if you make but the proper arrangements.  Here, as in other parts of the Continent, it is necessary to have your own carriage, and to have a servant who can speak the language, if you are unacquainted with it.  Sometimes a servant whose can drive would be found very useful, which was our case, for I travelled in company with two gentlemen, one of whom had a German servant who drove very well.  This was all the party; for not intending to make a long stay, I left my little girl behind me.

As the roads are not much frequented, to avoid waiting three or four hours for horses, we sent, as is the constant custom, an avant courier the night before, to order them at every post, and we constantly found them ready.  Our first set I jokingly termed requisition horses; but afterwards we had almost always little spirited animals that went on at a round pace.

The roads, making allowance for the ups and downs, are uncommonly good and pleasant.  The expense, including the postillions and other incidental things, does not amount to more than a shilling the Swedish mile.

The inns are tolerable; but not liking the rye bread, I found it necessary to furnish myself with some wheaten before I set out.  The beds, too, were particularly disagreeable to me.  It seemed to me that I was sinking into a grave when I entered them; for, immersed in down placed in a sort of box, I expected to be suffocated before morning.  The sleeping between two down beds—they do so even in summer—must be very unwholesome during any season; and I cannot conceive how the people can bear it, especially as the summers are very warm.  But warmth they seem not to feel; and, I should think, were afraid of the air, by always keeping their windows shut.  In the winter, I am persuaded, I could not exist in rooms thus closed up, with stoves heated in their manner, for they only put wood into them twice a day; and, when the stove is thoroughly heated, they shut the flue, not admitting any air to renew its elasticity, even when the rooms are crowded with company.  These stoves are made of earthenware, and often in a form that ornaments an apartment, which is never the case with the heavy iron ones I have seen elsewhere.  Stoves may be economical, but I like a fire, a wood one, in preference; and I am convinced that the current of air which it attracts renders this the best mode of warming rooms.

We arrived early the second evening at a little village called Quistram, where we had determined to pass the night, having been informed that we should not afterwards find a tolerable inn until we reached Stromstad.

Advancing towards Quistram, as the sun was beginning to decline, I was particularly impressed by the beauty of the situation.  The road was on the declivity of a rocky mountain, slightly covered with the mossy herbage and vagrant firs.  At the bottom, a river, straggling amongst the recesses of stone, was hastening forward to the ocean and its grey rocks, of which we had a prospect on the left; whilst on the right it stole peacefully forward into the meadows, losing itself in a thickly-wooded rising ground.  As we drew near, the loveliest banks of wild flowers variegated the prospect, and promised to exhale odours to add to the sweetness of the air, the purity of which you could almost see, alas! Not a smell, for the putrefying herrings, which they use as manure, after the oil has been extracted, spread over the patches of earth, claimed by cultivation, destroyed every other.

It was intolerable, and entered with us into the inn, which was in other respects a charming retreat.

Whilst supper was preparing I crossed the bridge, and strolled by the river, listening to its murmurs.  Approaching the bank, the beauty of which had attracted my attention in the carriage, I recognised many of my old acquaintance growing with great luxuriance.

Seated on it, I could not avoid noting an obvious remark.  Sweden appeared to me the country in the world most proper to form the botanist and natural historian; every object seemed to remind me of the creation of things, of the first efforts of sportive nature.  When a country arrives at a certain state of perfection, it looks as if it were made so; and curiosity is not excited.  Besides, in social life too many objects occur for any to be distinctly observed by the generality of mankind; yet a contemplative man, or poet, in the country—I do not mean the country adjacent to cities—feels and sees what would escape vulgar eyes, and draws suitable inferences.  This train of reflections might have led me further, in every sense of the word; but I could not escape from the detestable evaporation of the herrings, which poisoned all my pleasure.

After making a tolerable supper—for it is not easy to get fresh provisions on the road—I retired, to be lulled to sleep by the murmuring of a stream, of which I with great difficulty obtained sufficient to perform my daily ablutions.
The last battle between the Danes and Swedes, which gave new life to their ancient enmity, was fought at this place 1788; only seventeen or eighteen were killed, for the great superiority of the Danes and Norwegians obliged the Swedes to submit; but sickness, and a scarcity of provision, proved very fatal to their opponents on their return.

It would be very easy to search for the particulars of this engagement in the publications of the day; but as this manner of filling my pages does not come within my plan, I probably should not have remarked that the battle was fought here, were it not to relate an anecdote which I had from good authority.

I noticed when I first mentioned this place to you, that we descended a steep before we came to the inn; an immense ridge of rocks stretching out on one side.  The inn was sheltered under them; and about a hundred yards from it was a bridge that crossed the river, the murmurs of which I have celebrated; it was not fordable.  The Swedish general received orders to stop at the bridge and dispute the passage—a most advantageous post for an army so much inferior in force; but the influence of beauty is not confined to courts.  The mistress of the inn was handsome; when I saw her there were still some remains of beauty; and, to preserve her house, the general gave up the only tenable station.  He was afterwards broke for contempt of orders.

Approaching the frontiers, consequently the sea, nature resumed an aspect ruder and ruder, or rather seemed the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty.  Still it was sublime.

The clouds caught their hue of the rocks that menaced them.  The sun appeared afraid to shine, the birds ceased to sing, and the flowers to bloom; but the eagle fixed his nest high amongst the rocks, and the vulture hovered over this abode of desolation.  The farm houses, in which only poverty resided, were formed of logs scarcely keeping off the cold and drifting snow: out of them the inhabitants seldom peeped, and the sports or prattling of children was either seen or heard.  The current of life seemed congealed at the source: all were not frozen, for it was summer, you remember; but everything appeared so dull that I waited to see ice, in order to reconcile me to the absence of gaiety.

The day before, my attention had frequently been attracted by the wild beauties of the country we passed through.

The rocks which tossed their fantastic heads so high were often covered with pines and firs, varied in the most picturesque manner.  Little woods filled up the recesses when forests did not darken the scene, and valleys and glens, cleared of the trees, displayed a dazzling verdure which contrasted with the gloom of the shading pines.  The eye stole into many a covert where tranquility seemed to have taken up her abode, and the number of little lakes that continually presented themselves added to the peaceful composure of the scenery.  The little cultivation which appeared did not break the enchantment, nor did castles rear their turrets aloft to crush the cottages, and prove that man is more savage than the natives of the woods.  I heard of the bears but never saw them stalk forth, which I was sorry for; I wished to have seen one in its wild state.  In the winter, I am told, they sometimes catch a stray cow, which is a heavy loss to the owner.

The farms are small.  Indeed most of the houses we saw on the road indicated poverty, or rather that the people could just live.  Towards the frontiers they grew worse and worse in their appearance, as if not willing to put sterility itself out of countenance.  No gardens smiled round the habitations, not a potato or cabbage to eat with the fish drying on a stick near the door.  A little grain here and there are appeared, the long stalks of which you might almost reckon.  The day was gloomy when we passed over this rejected spot, the wind bleak, and winter seemed to be contending with nature, faintly struggling to change the season.  Surely, thought I, if the sun ever shines here it cannot warm these stones; moss only cleaves to them, partaking of their hardness, and nothing like vegetable life appears to cheer with hope the heart.

So far from thinking that the primitive inhabitants of the world lived in a southern climate where Paradise spontaneously arose, I am led to infer, from various circumstances, that the first dwelling of man happened to be a spot like this which led him to adore a sun so seldom seen; for this worship, which probably preceded that of demons or demigods, certainly never began in a southern climate, where the continual presence of the sun prevented its being considered as a good; or rather the want of it never being felt, this glorious luminary would carelessly have diffused its blessings without being hailed as a benefactor.  Man must therefore have been placed in the north, to tempt him to run after the sun, in order that the different parts of the earth might be peopled.  Nor do I wonder that hordes of barbarians always poured out of these regions to seek for milder climes, when nothing like cultivation attached them to the soil, especially when we take into the view that the adventuring spirit, common to man, is naturally stronger and more general during the infancy of society.  The conduct of the followers of Mahomet, and the crusaders, will sufficiently corroborate my assertion.

Approaching nearer to Stromstad, the appearance of the town proved to be quite in character with the country we had just passed through.  I hesitated to use the word country, yet could not find another; still it would sound absurd to talk of fields of rocks.

The town was built on and under them.  Three or four weather-beaten trees were shrinking from the wind, and the grass grew so sparingly that I could not avoid thinking Dr. Johnson’s hyperbolical assertion “that the man merited well of his country who made a few blades of grass grow where they never grew before,” might here have been uttered with strict propriety.  The steeple likewise towered aloft, for what is a church, even amongst the Lutherans, without a steeple?  But to prevent mischief in such an exposed situation, it is wisely placed on a rock at some distance not to endanger the roof of the church.

Rambling about, I saw the door open, and entered, when to my great surprise I found the clergyman reading prayers, with only the clerk attending.  I instantly thought of Swift’s “Dearly beloved Roger,” but on inquiry I learnt that some one had died that morning, and in Sweden it is customary to pray for the dead.

The sun, who I suspected never dared to shine, began now to convince me that he came forth only to torment; for though the wind was still cutting, the rocks became intolerably warm under my feet, whilst the herring effluvia, which I before found so very offensive, once more assailed me.  I hastened back to the house of a merchant, the little sovereign of the place, because he was by far the richest, though not the mayor.

Here we were most hospitably received, and introduced to a very fine and numerous families.  I have before mentioned to you the lilies of the north, I might have added, water lilies, for the complexion of many, even of the young women, seem to be bleached on the bosom of snow.  But in this youthful circle the roses bloomed with all their wonted freshness, and I wondered from whence the fire was stolen which sparkled in their fine blue eyes.

Here we slept; and I rose early in the morning to prepare for my little voyage to Norway.  I had determined to go by water, and was to leave my companions behind; but not getting a boat immediately, and the wind being high and unfavourable, I was told that it was not safe to go to sea during such boisterous weather; I was, therefore, obliged to wait for the morrow, and had the present day on my hands, which I feared would be irksome, because the family, who possessed about a dozen French words amongst them and not an English phrase, were anxious to amuse me, and would not let me remain alone in my room.  The town we had already walked round and round, and if we advanced farther on the coast, it was still to view the same unvaried immensity of water surrounded by barrenness.

The gentlemen, wishing to peep into Norway, proposed going to Frederic Hall, the first town—the distance was only three Swedish miles.  There and back again was but a day’s journey, and would not, I thought, interfere with my voyage.  I agreed, and invited the eldest and prettiest of the girls to accompany us.  I invited her because I like to see a beautiful face animated by pleasure, and to have an opportunity of regarding the country, whilst the gentlemen were amusing themselves with her.

I did not know, for I had not thought of it, that we were to scale some of the most mountainous cliffs of Sweden in our way to the ferry which separates the two countries.

Entering amongst the cliffs, we were sheltered from the wind, warm sunbeams began to play, streams to flow, and groves of pines diversified the rocks.  Sometimes they became suddenly bare and sublime.  Once, in particular, after mounting the most terrific precipice, we had to pass through a tremendous defile, where the closing chasm seemed to threaten us with instant destruction, when, turning quickly, verdant meadows and a beautiful lake relieved and charmed my eyes.

I had never travelled through Switzerland, but one of my companions assured me that I should not there find anything superior, if equal, to the wild grandeur of these views.

As we had not taken this excursion into our plan, the horses had not been previously ordered, which obliged us to wait two hours at the first post.  The day was wearing away.  The road was so bad that walking up the precipices consumed the time insensibly; but as we desired horses at each post ready at a certain hour, we reckoned on returning more speedily.

We stopped to dine at a tolerable farm; they brought us out ham, butter, cheese, and milk, and the charge was so moderate that I scattered a little money amongst the children who were peeping at us, in order to pay them for their trouble.
Arrived at the ferry, we were still detained, for the people who attend at the ferries have a stupid kind of sluggishness in their manner, which is very provoking when you are in haste.  At present I did not feel it, for, scrambling up the cliffs, my eye followed the river as it rolled between the grand rocky banks; and, to complete the scenery, they were covered with firs and pines, through which the wind rustled as if it were lulling itself to sleep with the declining sun.

Behold us now in Norway; and I could not avoid feeling surprise at observing the difference in the manners of the inhabitants of the two sides of the river, for everything shows that the Norwegians are more industrious and more opulent.  The Swedes (for neighbours are seldom the best friends) accuse the Norwegians of knavery, and they retaliate by bringing a charge of hypocrisy against the Swedes.  Local circumstances probably render both unjust, speaking from their feelings rather than reason; and is the astonishing when we consider that most writers of travels have done the same, whose works have served as materials for the compilers of universal histories?  All are eager to give a national character, which is rarely just, because they do not discriminate the natural from the acquired difference.  The natural, I believe, on due consideration, will be found to consist merely in the degree of vivacity, or thoughtfulness, pleasures or pain, inspired by the climate, whilst the varieties which the forms of government, including religion, produce are much more numerous and unstable.

A people have been characterised as stupid by nature; what a paradox! Because they did not consider that slaves, having no object to stimulate industry; have not their faculties sharpened by the only thing that can exercise them, self-interest.  Others have been brought forward as brutes, having no aptitude for the arts and sciences, only because the progress of improvement had not reached that stage which produces them.

Those writers who have considered the history of man, or of the human mind, on a more enlarged scale have fallen into similar errors, not reflecting that the passions are weak where the necessaries of life are too hardly or too easily obtained.

Travellers who require that every nation should resemble their native country, had better stay at home.  It is, for example, absurd to blame a people for not having that degree of personal cleanliness and elegance of manners which only refinement of taste produces, and will produce everywhere in proportion as society attain a general polish.  The most essential service, I presume, that authors could render to society, would be to promote inquiry and discussion, instead of making those dogmatically assertions which only appear calculated to gird the human mind round with imaginary circles, like the paper globe which represents the one he inhabits.

This spirit of inquiry is the characteristic of the present century, from which the succeeding will, I am persuaded, receive a great accumulation of knowledge; and doubtless its diffusion will in a great measure destroy the factitious national characters which have been supposed permanent, though only rendered so by the permanency of ignorance.

Arriving at Frederic Hall at the siege of which Charles XII lost his life, we had only time to take a transient view of it whilst they were preparing us some refreshment.

Poor Charles!  I thought of him with respect.  I have always felt the same for Alexander, with whom he has been classed as a madman by several writers, who have reasoned superficially, confounding the morals of the day with the few grand principles on which unchangeable morality rests.  Making no allowance for the ignorance and prejudices of the period, they do not perceive how much they themselves are indebted to general improvement for the acquirements, and even the virtues, which they would not have had the force of mind to attain by their individual exertions in a less advanced state of society.

The evening was fine, as is usual at this season, and the refreshing odour of the pine woods became more perceptible, for it was nine o’clock when we left Frederic Hall.  At the ferry we were detained by a dispute relative to our Swedish passport, which we did not think of getting countersigned in Norway.  Midnight was coming on, yet it might with such propriety have been termed the noon of night that, had Young ever travels towards the north, I should not have wondered at his becoming enamoured of the moon.  But it is not the Queen of Night alone who reigns here in all her splendor, though the sun, loitering just below the horizon, decks her within a golden tinge from his car, illuminating the cliffs that hide him; the heavens also, of a clear softened blue, throw her forward, and the evening star appears a smaller moon to the naked eye.  The huge shadows of the rocks, fringed with firs, concentrating the views without darkening them, excited that tender melancholy which, sublimating the imagination, exalts rather than depresses the mind.

My companions fell asleep—fortunately they did not snore; and I contemplated, fearless of idle questions, a night such as I had never before seen or felt, to charm the senses, and calm the heart.  The very air was balmy as it freshened into morn, producing the most voluptuous sensations.  A vague pleasurable sentiment absorbed me, as I opened my bosom to the embraces of nature; and my soul rose to its Author, with the chirping of the solitary birds, which began to feel, rather than see, advancing day.  I had leisure to mark its progress.  The grey morn, streaked with silvery rays, ushered in the orient beams (how beautifully varying into purple!), yet I was sorry to lose the soft watery clouds which preceded them, exciting a kind of expectation that made me almost afraid to breathe, lest I should break the charm.  I saw the sun—and sighed.

One of my companions, now awake, perceiving that the postillions had mistaken the road, began to swear at him, and roused the other two, who reluctantly shook off sleep.

We had immediately to measure back our steps, and did not reach Stromstad before five in the morning.
The wind had changed in the night, and my boat was ready.

A dish of coffee, and fresh linen, recruited my spirits, and I directly set out again for Norway, purposing to land much higher up the coast.
Wrapping my great-coat round me, I lay down on some sails at the bottom of the boat, its motion rocking me to rest, till a discourteous wave interrupted my slumbers, and obliged me to rise and feel a solitariness which was not so soothing as that of the past night.

2,Hey Lover,"[Intro: Michael McCary]
I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]

Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

3,"Gangsta's Paradise (From ""Dangerous Minds"")","Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:

*show ODB with hair*

You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:

""Fantastic Voyage""

Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood

Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside

Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it

A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by

And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned

*video starts*

You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:

""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone

Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke

Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise

You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down

Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street

And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…

So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams

And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success

Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:

They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…

Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...",Rap Critic,1995,"[4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 28]",20
4,Diggin' On You,"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

[Pre-Chorus]
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on, so I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Ain't no time for new relation-ships

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that

Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Bridge: Chilli (T-Boz)]
Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you
And I am diggin' the scene

So you say you wanna get away
We don't need a plane

Let them wash away your pain

I could be your fantasy

I could be your fantasy

Listen to the waves

So you say you wanna get so high?
Breathe me in like air tonight

7,Breakfast At Tiffany's,"Sid Arbuck: Hey! Hey, baby, what’s going on here?
Holly Golightly: Oh, hi.
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Gorightly! Someday...someday! Miss Gorightly!
Sid Arbuck: What happened to you anyway/You take off for the powder room. That’s the last I see you.
Holly Golightly: Now, really, Harry...
Sid Arbuck: Harry was the other guy. I’m Sid. Sid Arbuck. You like me, remember?
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Gorightly! I protest!
Holly Golightly: Oh, darling, I am sorry, but I lost my key.
Mr. Yunioshi: But, that was two weeks ago. You cannot go on keep ringing my bell. You disturb me. You must have a key made!
Holly Golightly: But it won’t do any good. I lose them all.
Sid Arbuck: Come on, baby. You like me. You know you do.
Holly Golightly: I worship you, Mr. Arbuck. Good night, Mr. Arbuck.
Sid Arbuck: Wait a minute! What is this? You like me. I’m a liked guy. You
like me, baby, you know you do. Didn’t I picked up the check for five people—your friends, I never seen them before. When you asked for change for the powder room, what did I give you? I give you a $50 bill. Now doesn’t that giveme some rights?
Mr. Yunioshi: In 30 seconds, I going to call the police! All the time, a disturbance! I get no sleep! I got to get my rest! I’m an artist! I going to call vice squad on you!
Holly Golightly: Don’t be angry, you dear little man. I won’t do it again. If you
promise not be angry, and I might let you take those pictures you mentioned.
Mr. Yunioshi: When?
Holly Golightly: Sometime.
Mr. Yunioshi: Anytime.
Holly Golightly: Good night.
Holly Golightly: Mmm.
Paul Varjak: I’m sorry to bother you, but I couldn’t get the downstairs door
open. Uh... I guess they sent me the upstairs key. I couldn’t get the downstairs door open. I said, I guess they sent me the...uh, upstairs key. I
couldn’t get the downstairs door open. I’m Sorry to wake you.
Holly Golightly: That’s quite all right. It could happen to anyone. Quite
frequently does. Good night.
Paul Varjak: I—I hate to, uh...I hate to bother you, but if I could ask one more
favor...could I use the phone?
Holly Golightly: Sure. Why not?
Paul Varjak: Hank you. Well, this is a...nice little place you’ve got here. You
just moved in, too, huh?
Holly Golightly: No. I’ve been here about a year. The phone’s over there. Well, it was. Oh, I remember. I stuck it in the suitcase. Kind of muffles the sound.
Paul Varjak: I’m...sorry. Is he all right?
Holly Golightly: Sure. Sure, he’s o.k. aren’t you, cat? Poor old cat. Poor slob. Poor slob without a name. The way I look at it I don’t have the right to give him one. We don’t belong to each other. We just took up by the river one day.
I don’t even want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I’m not sure where that is, but I know what it’s like. It’s like Tiffany’s.
Paul Varjak: Tiffany’s? You mean the jewelry store?
Holly Golightly: That’s right. I’m crazy about Tiffany’s. Listen. You know those days when you get the mean reds?
Paul Varjak: The mean reds? You mean, like the blues?
Holly Golightly: No the blues are because you’re getting fat or maybe it’s been raining too long. You’re just sad, that’s all. The mean reds are horrible.
Suddenly you’re afraid, and you don’t know what you’re afraid of. Don’t you
ever get that feeling?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: When I get it, the only thing that does any good is to jump
into a cab and go to Tiffany’s. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look. Nothing very bad could happen to you there. If I could find a real-life place that made me feel like Tiffany’s, then...then I’d buy some furniture and give the cat a name. I'm sorry. You wanted something. Oh, the
telephone.
Paul Varjak: It’s just that I’m supposed to meet somebody. I mean this is 10:00 Thursday morning, isn’t it? I just got off a plane from Rome, and I'm not too sure.
Holly Golightly: Thursday... is this Thursday?
Paul Varjak: I think so.
Holly Golightly: Thursday! Oh, no! It can’t be! It’s too gruesome!
Paul Varjak: Well, uh...what’s so gruesome about Thursday?
Holly Golightly: Nothing, except I never remember when it’s coming up, Wednesdays I generally just don’t go to bed at all because I have to be up to catch the 10:45. And they’re so particular about visiting hours. Would you be a
darling and look under the bed and see if you can find a pair of alligator shoes.
Paul Varjak: Sure
Holly Golightly: I’ve got to do something about the way I look. I mean a girl just can’t go to Sing Sing with a green face.
Paul Varjak: Sing Sing?
Holly Golightly: I always thought it was a ridiculous name for a prison. Sing Sing, I mean. It sounds more like it should be an opera house or something.
Black, alligator. You know all the visitors make an effort to look their best. It’s only fair. Actually, it’s very touching, all the women wearing their prettiest things. I just love them for it, and I love the kids. I mean the kids the wives bring. It should be sad seeing kids there, but it isn’t. They all have ribbons in
their hair and lots of shine on their shoes. You’d think there was going to be ice cream.
Paul Varjak: Now as I understand it, what we’re doing is we’re getting you ready to visit somebody at Sing Sing.
Holly Golightly: That’s right! You could always tell what kind of a person a man thinks you are by the earrings he gives you. I must say, the mind reels.
Paul Varjak: May I ask whom?
Holly Golightly: Whom what? Oh, whom I’m going to visit?
Paul Varjak: I guess that’s what I mean.
Holly Golightly: I don’t know that I should even discuss it. But, well, he never
told me not to tell anyone. Cross your heart and kiss your elbow.
Paul Varjak: I’ll try.
Holly Golightly: You probably read about him. His name is Sally Tomato.
Paul Varjak: Sally Tomato?
Holly Golightly: Oh, don’t look so shocked. They couldn’t prove he was even part of the mafia, much less head of it. My dear, the only thing that they did was prove that he cheated at his income tax. Anyway, all I know is that he’s a darling old man. He was never my lover or anything like that. In fact, I never
knew him until after he was in prison. But I adore him now. I mean. I’ve gone to see him every Thursday for seven months. Now I think I’d go even if he didn’t pay me. Shoes.
Paul Varjak: I could only find one. He pays you?
Holly Golightly: That’s right, or anyway his lawyer does, if he is a lawyer, which I doubt, since he doesn’t have an office, only an answering service, and he always wants to meet at Hamburger Heaven. There you are, you sneak.
Thank you.
Paul Varjak: You’re welcome.
Holly Golightly: Dress. Dress. Here we are. Bag, and a hat, too. There we are. Anyway, about seven months ago, this so-called lawyer, Mr. O’Shaughnessy, asked me how I’d like to cheer up a lonely old man and pick up a hundred a week at the same time. I told him, “look, darling, you’ve got the wrong Holly Golightly.” A girl can do as well as that on trips to the powder
room. I mean any gentleman with the slightest sheik will give a girl $50 bill for the powder room. And I always ask for cab fare too —that’s another 50. But then he told me his client was Sally Tomato. He said “Dear old Sally had seen me at Elmo’s or somewhere and had admired me a la distance. So wouldn’t it
be a good deed to visit him once a week? But, how could I say no? It was all so wildly romantic. How do I look?
Paul Varjak: Very good. I must say I’m amazed.
Holly Golightly: You were a darling to help. I could never have done it without you. Bag.
Paul Varjak: Call me anytime. I’m just upstairs, or I will be as soon as I get moved in.
Holly Golightly: Bye, cat.
Paul: Uh...
Paul Varjak: Uh, you mean he gives you $100 for an hour’s conversation?
Holly Golightly: Oh, Mr. O’Shaughnessy does as soon as I meet him and give him the weather report.
Paul Varjak: Look it’s none of my business, but it sounds to me like you could get in trouble.
Holly Golightly: Hold this for me, will you?
Paul Varjak: And what do you mean, weather report?
Holly Golightly: Oh there’s just a message I give Mr. O’Shaughnessy so he knows I’ve really been up there. Sally tells me things to say like, uh... oh, there’s a hurricane in Cuba, and cloudy over Palermo, things like that. You
don’t have to worry. I’ve taken care of myself a long time.
Paul Varjak: Taxi! I never could do that.
Holly Golightly: It’s easy.
2E: Paul. I’m late. I know it. Don’t tell me you were locked out? Didn’t you get the key? Oh, darling. I’m so sorry.
Paul Varjak: No, I got the key, all right. Miss Golightly, my neighbor, was kind
enough to let me in. Miss Golightly’s on her way to Sing Sing. Just visiting, of
course. Miss Golightly, Mrs. Falenson, my...decorator.
Holly Golightly: How do you do?
2E: How do you do? Ooh, darling. Let me look at you.
Holly Golightly: Are—are you through?
2E: Was the flight absolutely ghastly?
(at the same time) Holly Golightly: I’m in a terrible rush.
Holly Golightly: Grand central station, and step on it darling.
2E: Is it really only three weeks since I left you in Rome? Seems like years.
You seen the apartment?
Paul Varjak: Not yet.
2E: Hmmm I know it was wicked of me, but I couldn’t resist. I went ahead and
fixed it up without you. I think its darling of course, but if you absolutely hate it,
we can rip everything out and start from scratch.
Mr. Yunioshi: Uhh! Miss Gorightly!
Man: Hey, baby! Where you going? Aww. Come on, baby. Open the door.
Aw, be a pal. You’re breaking up a beautiful party. Come on, baby. Open the
door. Hey, the band’s swinging. Aw, come on, baby.
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Gorightly! Once again, I must protest! If you don’t stop
that phonograph right this minute, I’m going to call the police department.
Yeah. That more better.
Man: What’s the matter, baby? Aw, come on. You’re a great kid. Open the
door. Come on, baby. I’m waiting for you.
Holly Golightly: It’s all right. It’s only me.
Paul Varjak: Uh, wait a minute. Miss, uh...
Holly Golightly: Golightly. Holly Golightly. I live downstairs. We met this
morning. Remember?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: It’s all right. She’s gone. I must say she works late hours for
a decorator. The thing is, I have the most terrifying man downstairs. I mean
he’s sweet when he isn’t drunk, but let him start lapping up the vino, and, oh,
golly, quel beast. It finally got so tiresome down there, I went out the window.
Look you can throw me out if you want to, but you did looked so cozy in here,
and your decorator friend had gone home, and it was getting cold out thereon
the fire escape.
Paul Varjak: And I always heard people in New York never get to know their
neighbors. Well... how was Sing Sing?
Holly Golightly: Fine. I made the train and everything.
Paul Varjak: And what’s the weather report?
Holly Golightly: Small-craft warnings, block island to Hatteras—whatever
that means. You know, you’re sweet. You really are. And you look a little like
my brother Fred. Do you mind if I call you Fred?
Paul Varjak: Not at all.
Holly Golightly: 300. She’s very generous. Is that by the week, the hour, or
what?
Paul Varjak: Okay. The party’s over. Out.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred. Darling Fred, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your
feelings. Don’t be angry. I was just trying to let you know I understand. I
understand completely.
Paul Varjak: It’s okay. Stick around. Make yourself a drink. Throw me my
robe. I’ll make you one.
Holly Golightly: You stay right where you are. You must be absolutely
exhausted. I mean, it’s very late, and you were sound asleep and everything. I
suppose you think I’m very brazen or tres fou or something.
Paul Varjak: You’re no fouer than anybody else.
Holly Golightly: Yes, you do. Everybody does. And I don’t mind. It’s useful
being top banana in the shock department. What do you do, anyway?
Paul Varjak: I’m a writer, I guess.
Holly Golightly: You guess? Don’t you know?
Paul Varjak: Okay, positive statement. Ringing affirmative. I’m a writer.
Holly Golightly: The only writer I’ve ever been out with is Benny Shacklett.
He’s written an awful lot f television stuff, but quel rat. Tell me, are you a real
writer? I mean, does anybody buy what you write or publish it or anything?
Paul Varjak: They bought what’s in that box.
Holly Golightly: Yours?
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm.
Holly Golightly: All these books?
Paul Varjak: Well, there’s just the one book, 12 copies of it.
Holly Golightly: “nine lives, by Paul Varjak.” they’re stories.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm. Nine of them.
Holly Golightly: Tell me one.
Paul Varjak: They’re not the kind of stories you can really tell.
Holly Golightly: Too dirty?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, I...suppose they’re dirty, too, but only incidentally. Mainly
they’re angry, sensitive... intensely felt, and that dirtiest of all dirty words—
promising. Or so said the times book review, October 1, 1956.
Holly Golightly: 1956?
Paul Varjak: That’s right.
Holly Golightly: I suppose this is kind of a ratty question, but what have you
written lately?
Paul Varjak: Lately, I’ve been working on a novel.
Holly Golightly: Lately, since 1956?
Paul Varjak: Well, a novel takes a long time. I want it exactly right.
Holly Golightly: So, no more stories.
Paul Varjak: Well, the idea is I’m supposed to not fritter my talent on little
things. I’m supposed to be saving it for the big one.
Holly Golightly: Tell me. Do you write every day?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Today?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: It’s a beautiful typewriter.
Paul Varjak: Of course. It writes nothing but sensitive, intensely felt,
promising prose.
Holly Golightly: But there’s no ribbon in it.
Paul Varjak: There isn’t?
Holly Golightly: No.
Paul Varjak: Oh. You know something you said this morning has been
bothering me all day.
Holly Golightly: What’s that?
Paul Varjak: Do they really give you $50 whenever you go to the powder
room?
Holly Golightly: Of course.
Paul Varjak: You must do very well.
Holly Golightly: I’m trying to save, but I’m not very good at it. You know, you
do look a lot like my brother Fred. I haven’t seen him of course since I was 14.
That’s when I left home. And he was already 6’2”. I guess it must have been
the peanut butter that did it. Everybody thought he was dotty the way he
gorged himself on peanut butter, but he wasn’t dotty, just sweet and vague
and...Terribly slow. Poor Fred. He’s in the army now. That’s really the best
place for him until I can get enough money saved.
Paul Varjak: And then?
Holly Golightly: And then Fred and I... I went to Mexico once. It’s a wonderful
place for raising horses. I saw one place near the sea that... Fred’s very good
with horses. Even land in Mexico costs something. And no matter what I do,
there’s never seems to be more than a couple hundred dollars in the bank. It
can’t be 4:30. It just can’t. Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?
It’s all right. Really, it is. We’re friends. That’s all. We are friends, aren’t we?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Okay., let’s don’t say another word. Let’s just go to sleep.
Where are you, Fred? It’s cold. There—there’s snow in the wind.
Paul Varjak: What is it? What’s the matter? Why are you crying?
Holly Golightly: If we’re going to be friends, let’s just get one thing straight
right now. I hate snoops.
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
2E: Lucille, darling? 2E.
Paul Varjak: Huh?
2E: I’ve been trying desperately to reach you. Bill just got back—a day early,
the beast—so I’m afraid I’ll have to beg off. You’ll explain to the rest of the
girls? You’re a darling. Maybe we can have a long lunch tomorrow. I’ll phone
you in the morning.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm. Whatever you say.
2E: You will manage to survive without me tonight?
Paul Varjak: Sure. I might even take a wild boyish fling at writing.
2E: Good night.
Paul Varjak: Good night.
O.J. Berman: Got yourself stuffed, huh, Polly, baby? Serves you right,
bigmouth.
O.J. Berman: Buon giorno.
Irving: Huh?
O.J. Berman: Aren’t you drinking?
Irving: Mm-hmm.
O.J. Berman: You have pockets there or something? What do you go by?
Irving: Hmm?
O.J. Berman: What’s your name? What’s your name? What do you call
yourself?
Irving: Irving.
O.J. Berman: Ohh, yean. Perfect, perfect. That’s wonderful. Perfect. I’ll be
right back, Irving, baby.
Irving: Mm-hmm.
O.J. Berman: Yeah? Whoa whoa. Kid’s still in the shower. You expected?
Paul Varjak: I was invited. That what you mean?
O.J. Berman: Don’t get all tense and soft. Come on in. it’s a party. There’s a
lot of characters coming around here who aren’t expected. I’ll buy you a
drink. You drink?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
O.J. Berman: Then I’ll buy you a drink.
Paul Varjak: Okay.
O.J. Berman: Hey, honey, your skirt’s split there. What do you drink kid?
Paul Varjak: Bourbon.
O.J. Berman: Bourbon. On the rocks?
Paul Varjak: Yeah—no. with water.
O.J. Berman: You want rocks first?
Paul Varjak: Uh, yeah. Not too much.
O.J. Berman: All right. That’ll set you free. Know the kid long?
Paul Varjak: Not very. I live upstairs.
O.J. Berman: You’re kidding! Look at this place. What a place. It’s
unbelievable. What a dump. What do you think?
Paul Varjak: About what?
O.J. Berman: Is she or isn’t she? Wait a minute. Hold it. Harriet!
Guest: Hi, J.B.
O.J. Berman: “J.B.”? Oh! What’s that?
Guest: You know Gil?
O.J. Berman: Yeah. How are you?
Gil: How about a drink?
O.J. Berman: In the kitchen. You’ll find everything you need.
Gil: Thanks.
O.J. Berman: Yeah. So—oh, honey, that is you. That is you.
Holly Golightly: Fred, darling, I’m so glad you could come.
Paul Varjak: I brought you a house present. Something for the bookcase.
Holly Golightly: Oh, you’re sweet. Doesn’t that look nice? Give me a
cigarette,
O.J. Berman: Sure, sure.
Holly Golightly: O.J. he’s a great agent. He knows a lot of phone numbers.
What’s Jerry Weld’s phone number O.J.?
O.J. Berman: Come on, lay off.
Holly Golightly: I want you to call him and tell him Fred’s a genius. Stop
blushing, Fred. You didn’t say you’re a genius, I did. So Quit stalling O.J.. Just
tell him what you’re going to do to make Fred rich and famous?
O.J. Berman: Now why don’t you let Fred baby and me settle that, huh,
puppy?
Holly Golightly: Okay. But just remember, I’m the agent. He’s already got a
decorator. I’m the agent.
O.J. Berman: Hold it. Hi, boys. Come on in there. Right in the kitchen
everything you need. So listen, Fred, baby, What are—
Paul Varjak: No, its Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Oh! It is? I thought it was Fred, baby.
Paul Varjak: No
O.J. Berman: Well Answer the question. Is she or isn’t she?
Paul Varjak: Is she or isn’t she what?
O.J. Berman: A phony.
Paul Varjak: I don’t know. I don’t think so.
O.J. Berman: So, you don’t, huh? Well, you’re wrong. She is. Uh, on the
other hand, you’re right, because she’s a real phony. You know why?
Because she honestly believes all this phony junk that she believes in. I
mean it. Now look, I like the kid, I sincerely like the kid. I do. I’m sensitive,
that’s why. You got to be sensitive to like the kid. It’s .. It’s what you call a
touch, a streak of the poet.
Paul Varjak: You known her long?
O.J. Berman: Are you kidding? I’m the guy that discovered her. I’m O.J.
Berman. A couple of years ago, back in the coast, she was just a kid—lot of
style and class...you know
Paul Varjak: Lot of what?
O.J. Berman: Class. She had a lot of class. But when she opened her mouth,
you didn’t know what she was talking about—whether she was a hillbilly or an
Okie. You know how long it took me to smooth that accent?
Paul Varjak: No.
O.J. Berman: I’ll tell you how long. One year. Know how we did it? Ah We
gave her French lessons. Figured once she could imitate French, she‘d have
no trouble imitating English. And, ah, finally, when I thought she was ready I
arranged for a little screen test. The night before the screen test, oh I could
have killed myself. The night before, the phone rings. I picked it up. I said,
“O.J. speaking.” she says, “this is Holly.” I says Holly?, You sound so far away
honey. What’s with you?.” she says, “I’m in New York.” I said, “What kind of
New York? You gotta screen test tomorrow.” She says,” I’m in New York
because I’ve never been to New York before.” I says “Get yourself on the
plane, get back here.” ”She says, “I don’t want to.” “What do you mean you
don’t want to? What do you want?” she says, “I don’t want to.” I says, ”What
do you want?” She says, “when I find out what I want, I’m going to let you
know.” so, look, Fred, baby— you know. Don’t tell me --.
Paul Varjak: It’s Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Paul baby, sure . Don’t tell me she isn’t a phony. You know
what I mean?. Irving. Honey, Irving, where you been?
Holly Golightly: Mmm, thanks. Mike, darling, I tried reaching you all day long.
Your answering service doesn’t answer.
Guest: Well you know the kind of trouble people have with answering
services.
Holly Golightly: Well, I guess so. Say I saw your mother down at the Roxie
the other day.
Guest: And after all that she said about him, and he knows ….
Paul Varjak: Holly!
Female Guest: Time, darling.
Holly Golightly: What?
Female Guest: Time?
Holly Golightly: You have a watch?
Male Guest: No.
Holly Golightly: Oh, let me see. 6:45.
Female Guest: Thank you.
Female Guest: Aaahh! Really, was that necessary?
Paul Varjak: This is some party. Who are all these people, anyhow?
Holly Golightly: Who knows? The word gets out. You don’t mind, do you,
darling? Mmmm. Reinforcements.
Guests: Right in there.
Mag Wildwood: Holly? Holly, d-darling!
Paul Varjak: What’s that?
Holly Golightly: Mag Wildwood. She’s a model, believe it or not, and a
thumping bore. But just look at the goodies she brought with her.
Paul Varjak: He’s all right I suppose, if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking
men with passionate natures and too many teeth.
Holly Golightly: I don’t mean that one, I mean the other one.
Paul Varjak: The other one?
Holly Golightly: He’s Rusty Trawler.
Paul Varjak: Huh?
Holly Golightly: Rusty Trawler. He happens to be the ninth richest man in
America under 50.
Paul Varjak: Now, that, indeed, is a remarkable piece of information to have
at your fingertips.
Holly Golightly: I keep track of these things.
Delivery Boy: Excuse me. You owe me 47--
Holly Golightly: Hold this a minute for me will you darling.
Holly Golightly: Mag, darling, what are you doing here?
Mag Wildwood: Holly! I was upstairs working with Yunioshi—Easter stuff for
the b-bazaar. Then these two nice boys came to pick me up. It was a mistake,
of course. My wires got crossed somewhere. They were both very sweet
about it. May I present Jose Silva Pereira? He’s from Brazil. Miss G-Golightly.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Very kind of you, miss Golightly, to allow me to attend
your party. I’m so interested in North American culture. I’ve been already of
course to the statue of liberty and to the restaurant automatique. But this is
the first time I am in a typical North American home.
Mag Wildwood: Wouldn’t he just m-melt in your mouth? And this is Mr. Rusty
Trawler. Miss Golightly. You’re not vexed at me for bringing him?
Holly Golightly: Of course not, darling.
Mag Wildwood: Darling. I’m glad. Now, who’s going to bring me a bourbon?
Holly Golightly: O.J.
O.J. Berman: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?
O.J. Berman: Yeah. Which one’s Miss Wildwood?
Mag Wildwood: Mr. Berman, we haven’t been formally introduced. But I’m
Mag Wildwood from Wildwood, Arkansas. That’s...hill country.
Holly Golightly: Now, you just make yourself right at home, senor
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, don’t trouble yourself. I’m contented to stand
observing the customs of your country.
Holly Golightly: Okay, you do that. Now come along, Mr. Trawler. Let’s see
what we can find to amuse you with.
Husband: I wasn’t supposed to pick you up.
Wife: You said you would pick me up, and at the last minute I had …
Husband: Look I wasn’t supposed to pick you up, here or anywhere.
Paul Varjak: Yeah?
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Golightly? This time I’m a-warning you! I am definitely this
time going to calling the police!
Female Guest: Wow!
Male Guest: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Is it something important?
Paul Varjak: Nah. just the guy upstairs complaining about the noise.
Jose da Silva Pereira: He’s angry.
Paul Varjak: Well, He did mention something about calling the police.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, the police. The police? Oh! That I cannot have. I’d
better look for Miss Wildwood and go.
Female Guest: To think I’d find a beau of mine mousing after a piece of
cheap Hollywood trash.
Holly Golightly: Mag, darling, you’re being a bore.
Mag Wildwood: Shut up, you! You know what’s going to happen to you? I’m
going to march you over to the zoo and feed you to the yak... just as soon as I
finish this drink.
Holly Golightly: Timber!
Aaahh!
Sorry. Oh.
O.J. Berman: Oh, good evening, Ed.
Paul Varjak: It’s Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Oh, yes. You remember Irving, don’t you?
Paul Varjak: This is Jose.
O.J. Berman: Nice to meet you.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Wonderful seeing you.
O.J. Berman: Yes -- Jewel thieves.
Holly Golightly: Sally helps me with my accounts. I have no head for figures
at all. I’m trying desperately to save some money, you know I told you. I just
can’t seem to. He makes me write down everything in there. What I get, what I
spend. I used to have a checking account. He made me get rid of that. He
feels, for me anyway, that it’s better to operate on a cash basis, tax wise.
Sally Tomato: Someday, Mr. Fred, you take this book, turn into a novel.
Everything is there. Just fill in a little of the details.
Holly Golightly: Certainly would be good for some laughs.
Sally Tomato: No. no, I don’t think so. This is a book would break the heart.
“Mr. Fitzsimons—powder room, $50. “Less $18--repair one black satin dress.
Cat food, 27 cents.”
Holly Golightly: Sally, darling, please stop. You’re making me blush. But
you’re right about jack Fitzsimons. He’s an absolute rat. But I guess, of
course, I really don’t know anybody but rats. Except, of course, Fred here.
You do think Fred is nice, don’t you Sally?
Sally Tomato: For you... I hope he is.
Convict: Give me a kiss goodbye.
Holly Golightly: Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.
Paul Varjak: Goodbye, Uncle Sally.
Sally Tomato: Goodbye and don’t forget to send that book. Heh?!
Paul Varjak: I won’t.
Holly Golightly: Oh, what about the weather report?
Sally Tomato: Oh, yes. Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans.
Holly Golightly: Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans? Isn’t
that the weirdest? I bet they haven’t had snow in New Orleans for a million
years. I don’t know how he thinks them up.
Holly Golightly: Moon river wider than a mile I’m crossin’’ you in style
someday oh, dream maker you heartbreaker wherever you’re goin’ I’m goin’
your way two drifters off to see the world there’s such a lot of world to see
we’re after the same rainbow’s end waitin’ ‘round the bend my huckleberry
friend moon river and me.
Hi.
Paul Varjak: Hi.
Holly Golightly: What you doin’?
Paul Varjak: Writing.
Holly Golightly: Good.
Paul Varjak: Well, hello. What’s wrong?
2E: I don’t know. It’s probably nothing. I want to see if he’s still there.
Paul Varjak: See if who’s still there? What are you talking about?
2E: Look. See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon. I didn’t say anything. I
didn’t want to sound neurotic, but... when he’s there again today...
Paul Varjak: Who do you think he is?
2E: It could be anybody, of course, but what crossed my mind was... suppose
Bill’s having us watched, huh?
Paul Varjak: I’ll take care of this.
2E: No. no, don’t. Please. If that’s what it is, you’ll only make everything
worse.
Paul Varjak: I’ll be careful. You wait here.
2E: Darling, please don’t. I don’t think you should.
Paul Varjak: Now, take it easy. I just want to find out what this is all about.
Paul Varjak: All right, what do you want?
Doc Golightly: Son, I need a friend. That’s me, that’s her, that’s her brother
Fred.
Paul Varjak: You’re Holly’s father?
Doc Golightly: Her name ain’t holly. She was Lula Mae Barnes. Was till she
married me. I’m her husband Doc Golightly.
Paul Varjak: Paul Varjak.
Doc Golightly: I’m a horse Doctor. Animal man. Do some farming, too, near
tulip, Texas. Her brother Fred’s getting out of the army soon. Lula Mae
belongs home with her husband, her brother, and her children.
Paul Varjak: Children?
Doc Golightly: Them’s her children.
Paul Varjak: She’s got four children?
Doc Golightly: Now, son, I didn’t claim they was her natural-born children.
Their own precious mother—precious woman—passed away July 4th,
independence day, 1955, the year of the drought. When I married Lula Mae,
she was going on 14. Now you might think the average person going on 14
wouldn’t know his own mind. But you take Lula Mae, she was an exceptional
person. I’ll tell you son she just plumb broke our hearts when she run off like
she done. Just plain had no reason. All the housework was done by our
daughters. Lula Mae could just take it easy. I tell you that woman got
positively fat, while her brother, he growed up into a giant, which is a sight
different from the way they come to us. A couple of wild young’uns they was. I
caught ‘em outside the house stealing milk and turkey eggs. Lula Mae and her
brother had been living with some mean, no-account people about 100 mile
east of tulip. She had good cause to run off from that house. Never had none
to leave mine.
Paul Varjak: What about her brother? Didn’t he leave, too?
Doc Golightly: No sir. We had Fred with us till they took him in the army.
That’s why I come to talk to her about. I had a letter from him. He’s getting out
of the army in February. That’s why I got on a Greyhound bus to come and
get her. Lula Mae’s place is with her husband, her children, and her brother.
Huh?
Paul Varjak The prize from the cracker jack. Want it?
Doc Golightly: Uh-uh. Never could understand why that woman run off. Don’t
tell me she weren’t happy. Talky as a jaybird she was, with something smart
to say on every subject. Better than the radio. The night I proposed, I cried
like a baby. She said, “What do you want to cry for, Doc? Of course we’ll be
married. I never been married before.” Well I had laughed and hugged and
squeezed her. “Never been married before.” listen, son, I advise you, I need a
friend, ‘cause I don’t want to surprise her or scare her none. Be my friend. Let
her know I’m here. Will you do that for me, son?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, sure, Doc, if that’s what you want. Come on.
Holly Golightly: All right. Coming. Oh, darling, I’m just on my way out. I’m
supposed to be at 21 half an hour ago. Maybe we can have a drink or
something tomorrow.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Lula Mae... if you’re still here tomorrow.
Holly Golightly: Oh, please, where is he? Fred? Fred?
Doc Golightly: Gosh. Lula Mae. Gee, honey, don’t they feed you up here?
You’re so skinny.
Holly Golightly: Hi, Doc.
Doc Golightly: Gosh, Lula Mae... kingdom come.
Paul Varjak: What is it? What’s the matter? You all right?
Holly Golightly: I guess so. No, I’m not. Fred will you help me?
Paul Varjak: If I can.
Holly Golightly: I want you to come to the bus station with us, Doc and me.
He still thinks I’m going back with him. I don’t know if I can play the scene
alone.
Paul Varjak: Holly. What can I do? He’s your husband.
Holly Golightly: No, he’s not.
Paul Varjak: He’s not?
Holly Golightly: It was annulled ages ago. But he just won’t accept it. Please,
Fred, I’ll tell him you’re seeing us off. Don’t say anything. Just meet us out
front in about an hour. Please?
Doc Golightly: You wait right here, honey. I’ll get the bag.
Paul Varjak: Why don’t I get some Magazines?
Holly Golightly: Please, Fred, don’t leave me.
Train Attendant: Attention, please. Leaving from platform five, through coach
to Dallas—Philadelphia, Columbus, Indianapolis, Terre haute, St.. Louis,
Tulsa, Oklahoma city, Denison, Dallas.
Doc Golightly: Come on, Lula Mae. That’s us.
Holly Golightly: Doc, I’m not coming with you. Come on. Let’s walk together
quietly and I’ll try and help you understand. Help me talk to him, Fred.
Doc Golightly: That’s alright son. I appreciate you want to help, but it’s
between Lula Mae and me.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Doc.
Doc Golightly: I love you, Lula Mae.
Holly Golightly: I know you do, and that’s the trouble. It’s a mistake you
always made DOC—trying to love a wild thing. You were always lugging
home wild things—Once it was a hawk with a broken wing. Another time it
was a full-grown wildcat with a broken leg... remember?
Doc Golightly: Lula Mae there’s something—
Holly Golightly: You mustn’t give your heart to a wild thing. The more you do,
the stronger they get until they’re strong enough to run into the woods or fly
into a tree, then to higher trees, then to the sky.
Doc Golightly: Lula Mae there’s something I got to tell you.
Stranger: Excuse me.
Doc Golightly: A couple weeks ago, I got a letter from young Fred.
Holly Golightly: From Fred? He’s all right, isn’t he?
Doc Golightly: Yeah, he’s fine, I guess. He’s getting out of the army in
February. That’s what he wrote to tell me about.
Holly Golightly: In February? Well, that’s only four months.
Doc Golightly: So, see, you got to come back Lula Mae. Your place is with
me, your children and your brother.
Holly Golightly: Doc, you’ve got to understand. I can’t come back.
Doc Golightly: And you got to understand what I’m trying to tell you. I don’t
want to seem like I’m pressuring you, but it got to. If you don’t come back with
me, I’m going to have to write young Fred, tell him that unless he wants to
look out for himself, he better sign up for another hitch.
Holly Golightly: Doc don’t you do that. Don’t you write that to him. I’ll write
him myself and tell him I want him here with me. I’ll take care of him. Don’t
you worry.
Doc Golightly: You’re talking crazy, Lula Mae.
Holly Golightly: Doc, stop calling me that. I’m not Lula Mae anymore.
Doc Golightly: All right, Lula Mae. I guess you know what you’re doing.
Doc Golightly: Keep an eye on her, will you, son? At least see she eats
something once in a while.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Doc.
Doc Golightly: So skinny.
Holly Golightly: Please, Doc. please understand. I love you, but I’m just not
Lula Mae anymore. I’m not.
Holly Golightly: You know the terrible thing, Fred, darling? I am still Lula
Mae-- 14 years old, stealing turkey eggs, and running through a briar patch.
Except now I call it having the mean reds. Well, it’s still too early to go to
Tiffany’s. I guess the next best thing is a drink. Yes, I very much need a drink.
Will you buy me one, Fred, darling?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Only promise me one thing—don’t take me home until I’m
drunk... until I’m very drunk, indeed.
Holly Golightly: Do you think she’s talented, deeply and importantly
talented?
Paul Varjak: Hmm. No. amusingly and superficially talented, yes, but deeply
and importantly, no.
Holly Golightly: Gracious. Do you think she’s handsomely paid?
Paul Varjak: Hmm? Oh. Indeed.
Holly Golightly: Well, let me tell you something mister. If I had her money, I’d
be richer than she is.
Paul Varjak: How do you figure that?
Holly Golightly: Because I’d keep the candy store. Old Sally Tomato—that’s
my candy store. I’d always keep Sally. And that’s why I’d be richer than she is.
Paul Varjak: Hmm. We’d better get a little more air.
Holly Golightly: Tom, Dick, and Harry—no. correction. Every tom, dick, and
Sid—Harry was his friend. Anyway, every tom, dick, and Sid sinks—thinks if
he takes a girl to dinner, she’ll just curl up like a kitten, in a little furry ball at
his feet, right? I have by actual count been taken to dinner by 26 different rats
in the last 2 months, 27, if you count Benny Shacklet, who’s in many ways a
super rat.
Paul Varjak: I think I forgot my key.
Holly Golightly: Never mind. I just buzzed Yunioshi.
Paul Varjak: Oh.
Holly Golightly: Do you want to know something funny? In spite of the fact
that most of these rats fork up $50 for the powder room like little dolls... Again
I find by actual account, I have $9.00 less in the old bank account than I had
six months ago. So, my darling Fred, I have tonight made a very serious
decision.
Paul Varjak: And what is that?
Holly Golightly: No longer will I play the field.
Paul Varjak: Congratulations.
Holly Golightly: The field stinks, both economically and socially, and I’m
giving it up.
Paul Varjak: Whoa.
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Golightly, this time I’m not only calling the police, the fire
department, and New York state housing commission, and, if necessary, the
board of health!
Holly Golightly: Quiet, up there. You want to wake the whole house? as miss
Golightly was saying before she was so rudely interrupted, miss Golightly
further announces her intention to devote her not inconsiderable talents to the
immediate capture, for the purpose of matrimony, of Mr. Br-Rutherford—Rusty
to his friends, of whom I’m sure he has many—Trawler.
Paul Varjak: Who?
Holly Golightly: Rusty Trawler. You met him at my party. A couple of weeks
ago. He came with Mag Wildwood, not the beautiful Latin type. The other one,
the one that looks like a pig. Remember? The 9th richest man in America
under 50?
Ah... Do I detect a look of disapproval in your eye? Tough beans, buddy,
‘cause that’s the way it’s going to be. Hi, Cat.
Paul Varjak: Holly, you’re drunk.
Holly Golightly: True. Absolutely true. True, but irrelevant.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
Holly Golightly: So I think we should have a drink to the new Mrs. Rusty
Trawler... me.
Paul Varjak: Hey, take it easy.
Holly Golightly: What’s the matter? Don’t you think I can do it? Tell me.
Seriously I’m interested. Don’t you think I can? You heard the Doc. my brother
gets out of the army in February. The Doc won’t take him back. It’s all up to
me. I don’t know why you don’t understand. I need money, and I’ll do
whatever I have to do to get it. So... this time next month, I’ll be the new Mrs.
Rusty Trawler. And I think we should have a little drink to that. It’s all gone.
Isn’t that too bad? Got any whiskey upstairs?
Paul Varjak: But you’ve had enough.
Holly Golightly: Go ahead. Get the whiskey. I’ll pay you for it.
Paul Varjak: Holly, please.
Holly Golightly: No, no. you disapprove of me, and I do not accept drinks
from gentlemen who disapprove of me. I’ll pay for my own whiskey. And don’t
you forget it.
Paul Varjak: Holly.
Holly Golightly: I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentlemen,
especially not disapproving gentlemen who are kept by other ladies. So take
it. You should be used to taking money from ladies by now.
Paul Varjak: If I were you, I’d be more careful with my money. Rusty Trawler
is too hard a way of earning it.
Holly Golightly: It should take you exactly four seconds to cross from here to
that door. I’ll give you two.
Paul Varjak:: Heh.
Paul Varjak: Hi. I came up to talk to you about the other night, then I saw the
paper, and—well, actually, I’m kind of embarrassed about it, but since it
concerns you, I thought I ought to talk about it in person.
Holly Golightly: What?
Paul Varjak: What?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Oh. The earplugs. Well I can’t go through the whole thing again.
It’s sufficient to say, I’ve come to make up. As an added inducement, I have
all kinds of news. Can I come in?
Holly Golightly: I guess so. Just a minute. Do I have a nightgown on? No, I
don’t. Would you mind turning around for a second? On second thought never
mind. That’s such a corny line anyway. I’ll turn around myself. Come in.
Paul Varjak: Have... you seen the paper?
Holly Golightly: Mm. Rusty, you mean.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm.
Holly Golightly: Yes. I know all about it. Certainly had him... pegged wrong,
didn’t I? I thought he was just a rat, but he was a super rat all along. A super
rat in rat’s clothing. You don’t even know the best part. Not only was he a rat
or super rat. Rather he was also broke. Broke? I mean, but not a farthing. His
family has money, of course, but he personally is broke. It turns out he owes
$700,000. Can you imagine anyone owing $700,000? $43, yes. Anyway,
that’s why he decided to marry the queen of the pig people. I’ll tell you one thing, Fred, darling—I’d marry you for your money in a minute. Would you marry me for my money?
Paul Varjak: In a minute.
Holly Golightly: So I guess it’s pretty lucky neither of us is rich, huh?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred, darling, I’m so glad to see you. What have you
been doing?
Paul Varjak: Writing, mostly. Sold a story. Just got word this morning.
Holly Golightly: Oh, that’s marvelous. It really is. But only how does your decorator friend feel about it? I thought you were supposed to be saving yourself and all that.
Paul Varjak: You know something? I haven’t quite got around to telling heryet. Look, why don’t we go have a drink or take a walk to celebrate?
Holly Golightly: All right. I think there’s some champagne in the icebox. Why don’t you open it while I get dressed?
Paul Varjak: Okay I don’t think I’ve ever drunk champagne before breakfast before. With breakfast on several occasions, but never before before.
Holly Golightly: Well, I’ve got a wonderful idea. We can spend the whole day doing things we’ve never done before. We’ll take turns. First something you’ve never done, then me. ‘Course, I can’t really think of anything I’ve never done.
Whoa!
Holly Golightly: I’ve never been for a walk in the morning before. At least not
since I’ve been in New York. I’ve walked up 5th avenue at 6:00, but as far as
I’m concerned that still night. Do you think it counts?
Paul Varjak: Sure, it counts. Now we’re even.
Holly Golightly: Don’t you just love it?
Paul Varjak: Love what?
Holly Golightly: Tiffany’s.
Isn’t it wonderful? You see what I mean, how nothing bad could happen to you in a place like this? It isn’t that I give a hoot about jewelry, except
diamonds, of course.
Like that.
What do you think?
Paul Varjak: Well...
Holly Golightly: Of course personally, I think it would be tacky to wear diamonds before I’m 40.
Paul Varjak: Well, you’re right, but in the meantime, you should have something.
Holly Golightly: I’ll wait.
Paul Varjak: No. I’m going to buy you a present. You bought me a typewriter ribbon, and it brought me luck.
Holly Golightly: Alright, but Tiffany’s can be pretty expensive.
Paul Varjak: I’ve got my check and $10.
Holly Golightly: Oh, I wouldn’t let you cash your check, but a present for $10 or under, that I’ll accept. Of course, I don’t know exactly what we’re going to
find at Tiffany’s for $10.
Salesclerk: May I help you?
Paul Varjak: Perhaps. Actually we were looking for a present for the lady.
Salesclerk: Certainly, sir. Was there something special you had in mind?
Paul Varjak: Well, we had considered diamonds, and I don’t want to offend you, but the lady feels that diamonds are tacky for her.
Holly Golightly: Oh, I think they’re divine on older women, but I don’t think they’d be right for me, you do understand.
Salesclerk: Certainly.
Paul Varjak: In all fairness, I think I ought to explain there’s also a secondary
problem, one of finance. We can only afford to spend... a limited amount.
Salesclerk: May I ask how limited?
Holly Golightly: $10.
Salesclerk: $10.
Paul Varjak: That was the outside figure, yes.
Salesclerk: I see.
Holly Golightly: Do you have anything for $10?
Salesclerk: Frankly, madam, within that price range, the variety of
merchandise is rather limited. However, I do think we might have—let me
see... strictly as a novelty, you understand, for the lady and gentleman who
has everything, a sterling silver telephone dialer. That’s 6.75, including tax.
Paul Varjak: A sterling silver telephone dialer.
Salesclerk: Yes, sir. That’s 6.75, including federal tax.
Paul Varjak: Well, the price is right, but I must say, I’d rather hoped for
something slightly more—how shall I say it—romantic in feeling. What do you
think?
Holly Golightly: A sterling silver telephone dialer—I certainly think it’s
handsome, but, I mean-- , you do understand.
Paul Varjak: Well, we tried, but—we could have something engraved,
couldn’t we?
Salesclerk: Yes, I suppose so. Yes, indeed. The only problem is, you’d more
or less have to buy something first in order to have some object upon which to
place the engraving. You see the difficulty?
Paul Varjak: Well, we could have this engraved, couldn’t we? I think it would
be very smart.
Salesclerk: This, I take it, was not purchased at Tiffany’s?
Paul Varjak: No. actually, it was purchased concurrent with—well, actually, it
came inside a... well, a box of cracker jack.
Salesclerk: I see. Do they still really have prizes in cracker jack boxes?
Paul Varjak: Oh, yes.
Salesclerk: That’s nice to know. It gives one a feeling of solidarity, almost of
continuity with the past, that sort of thing.
Holly Golightly: You think Tiffany’s would really engrave it for us? I mean you
don’t think they’d feel it beneath them or anything like that?
Salesclerk: Well, it is rather unusual, madam, but I think you’ll find that
Tiffany’s is very understanding. If you would tell me what initials you would
like, I think we could have something ready for you in the morning.
Holly Golightly: Didn’t I tell you this was a lovely place?
Holly Golightly: What is this place anyway?
Paul Varjak: You said you wanted to sit down. It’s the public library. You’ve
never been here?
Holly Golightly: No. that makes two for me. I don’t see any books.
Paul Varjak: They’re in there. See?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Each one of these little drawers is stuffed with little cards. And
each little card is a book or an author.
Holly Golightly: I think that’s fascinating.
Paul Varjak: V-a-r-j-a-k.
Holly Golightly: Really? Look. Isn’t it marvelous? There you are, right in the
public library. “Varjak, Paul. Nine lives.” then a lot of numbers. Do you think
they really have the book itself, live?
Paul Varjak: Sure. Follow me.
Paul Varjak: Number 57. That’s us.
Holly Golightly: 57, please. Nine lives by Varjak, Paul.
Librarian: Shh.
Holly Golightly: Did you ever read it? It’s absolutely marvelous.
Librarian: No, I’m afraid I haven’t.
Holly Golightly: Well you should. He wrote it. He’s Varjak, Paul, in person.
She doesn’t believe me. Show her your driver’s license or diners’ club card or
something. Honestly he really is the author. Cross my heart and kiss my
elbow.
Librarian: Would you kindly lower your voice, Miss?
Holly Golightly: Why don’t you autograph it to her. Don’t you think that would
be nice? Sort of make it more personal?
Librarian: Really, miss...
Holly Golightly: Go ahead. Don’t be so stuck up. Autograph it to them.
Paul Varjak: What shall I say?
Holly Golightly: Something sentimental, I think.
Librarian: What are you doing? Stop that. You’re defacing public property.
Holly Golightly: Well alright, if that’s the way you feel, come on Fred darling,
let’s get out of here. I don’t think this place is half as nice as Tiffany’s.
Holly Golightly: Hey did you ever steal anything from a 5-and-10? When you
were a kid I mean.
Paul Varjak: No. I’m the sensitive, bookish type. Did you?
Holly Golightly: I used to. I still do now and then, sort of to keep my hand in.
come on. Don’t be chicken. Anyway, you’ve never done it, and it’s your turn.
I can’t see.
Paul Varjak: Hi, Cat. Lady of the house at home? Holly? Holly.
Paul Varjak: Trick or treat.
2E: You’re crazy. You know that, don’t you? But I love you anyway.
Paul Varjak: 2E.
2E: Yeah?
Paul Varjak: I’ve... got to talk to you.
2E: All right.
Paul Varjak: You want a drink?
2E: Uh-uh. If this is going to be a serious discussion, and suddenly I’m terribly
afraid it is, you’re going to have to take off that ridiculous mask. Or else I’m
going have to wear one, too.
Paul Varjak: 2E, look, please.
2E: What’s the matter? Girl trouble? Is that it, darling? Oh, I see. Well, that’s
not so serious. As a matter of fact, I’ve been expecting it. I can’t say I like it,
but I’ve been expecting it. Who is she?
Paul Varjak: Hasn’t got anything to do with her. This is between you and me.
2E: Oh. Then it is serious. Well, now.
Paul Varjak: 2E, you’re a very stylish girl. Can’t we end this stylishly?
2E: End it?
Paul Varjak: Yes.
2E: Well... I do believe love has found Andy hardy. Let’s see... a waitress? A
salesgirl? No. she’d have to be someone rich, wouldn’t she, Paul? Someone
who could help you.
Paul Varjak: Curiously enough... she’s a girl who can’t help anyone, not even
herself. The thing is, I can help her, and it’s a nice feeling for a change.
2E: All right. I understand. I’ll tell you what, Paul. I am a very stylish girl.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
2E: Writing a check. Don’t look so bewildered. Surely you’ve noticed me
writing checks before. Pay to the order of Paul Varjak-- $1,000. Take her
away somewhere for a week. You’re entitled to a vacation with pay. Simply a
matter of fair labor practice, darling. Of course if you were really smart, you’d
get the boys together and organize a union. That way you’d get all the fringe
benefits—hospitalization, a pension plan, and unemployment insurance when
you’re... how shall I put it? Between engagements.
Paul Varjak: Thanks for making it easier for me.
2E: Don’t be ridiculous, darling. Take the check. And call your girl.
Paul Varjak: No, thanks. I’ve got a check of my own. When you get yourself a
new writer to help, try and find one my size. That way you won’t have to even
shorten the sleeves.
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly! Hey!
Stranger: Oh! What are you doing?
Paul Varjak: Excuse me. Uh, I—I’m sorry. You look just like a girl I know
named Holly.
Stranger: Really?
Paul Varjak: I’m sorry.
Paul Varjak: Hi.
Holly Golightly: What do you want?
Paul Varjak: I want to talk to you.
Holly Golightly: I’m busy.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
Holly Golightly: Reading.
Paul Varjak: South America—land of wealth and promise?
Holly Golightly: It’s very interesting.
Paul Varjak: Let’s get out of here. I said let’s get out of here. I want to talk to
you.
Holly Golightly: Shh!
Paul Varjak: What’s the matter with you anyway? What’s happened?
Holly Golightly: Fred, will you please just leave me alone?
Paul Varjak: Holly. I love you.
Paul Varjak: Where are you going?
Holly Golightly: To the ladies room.
Paul Varjak: What’s the matter with you anyway?
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: No.
Holly Golightly: Fred, please let me go.
Paul Varjak: Let’s get something straight. I am not now nor have I ever been
Fred, nor am I Benny Shacklett, whoever he may be. My name is Paul—Paul
Varjak—and I love you.
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: Not till we get this settled. Now what’s all this jazz about south
America?
Holly Golightly: I thought if I’m marrying a south American, I’d better find out
something about the country.
Paul Varjak: Marry? What south American?
Holly Golightly: Jose.
Paul Varjak: Who the hell’s Jose?
Holly Golightly: Jose de Silva Pereira.
Paul Varjak: Who the hell’s Jose de Silva Pereira?
Holly Golightly: Darling, you met him. I know you did. Mag Wildwood’s
friend. The tall good looking one who came to the party with Rusty. Well, my
dear, you won’t believe this, but it turns out not only is he handsome and
wildly rich, he’s absolutely cuckoo for me.
Paul Varjak: You’re crazy.
Holly Golightly: What do you think you own me?
Paul Varjak: That’s exactly what I think.
Holly Golightly: I know, I know. That’s what everybody always thinks, but
everybody happens to be wrong.
Paul Varjak: Look, I am not everybody. Or am I? Is that what you really think?
That I’m no different from all your other rats and super rats? Wait a minute. If
that’s it... if that’s what you really think... there’s something I want to give you.
Holly Golightly: What’s that?
Paul Varjak: $50 for the powder room.
Holly Golightly: I wouldn’t ask you in, except the place is in such a mess, I
couldn’t bear to face it alone.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Ah, you have a message.
Holly Golightly: No.
Jose da Silva Pereira: ole.
Holly Golightly: Good evening, Mr. Yunioshi.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, good evening, Paul.
Paul Varjak: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Please, you must help me.
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly!
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly!
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: Holly. Holly.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred.
Paul Varjak: Holly.
Holly Golightly: No, no. Fred. Fred.
Paul Varjak: What did you do to her?
Jose da Silva Pereira: Nothing. There was a telegram, and then this—
crashing everything and acting like a crazy—it’s appalling. I can’t have a
public scandal. It’s too delicate—my name, my position, my family. Will there
be the police again? You think?
Paul Varjak: I don’t see why. There’s no law against busting up your
apartment. Where is the telegram?
Holly Golightly: There it is.
Paul Varjak: Received notice young Fred killed...” “In jeep accident, fort riley,
Kansas.” “Your husband and children join in the sorrow of our mutual loss.”
“Letter following. Love, Doc.” her brother Fred.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh. This brother, was she very close to him?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Jose da Silva Pereira: What can one do?
Paul Varjak: Try to help her. I tried. It didn’t do much good. You got a ranch
or something down in Brazil don’t you?
Jose da Silva Pereira: Yes.
Paul Varjak: That’s good. She’ll like that. Well, you better get in there.
Holly Golightly: Hi.
Paul Varjak: Hello. Got your wire. How did you know where to reach me?
Holly Golightly: Oh, I tried everything—called people, asked around, and
suddenly I thought of looking in the phone book. Anyway, I’m glad you could
come.
Paul Varjak: You look fine.
Holly Golightly: You think so? I’m fat as a pig, and I haven’t had my hair
done, but I’m happy, really happy. It probably shows. You look tres distingue
yourself.
Paul Varjak: I’ve got a job. I’ve been writing a little.
Holly Golightly: I know. I’ve read three of your stories—two in the New
Yorker and one in that funny little Magazine. Won’t you sit down?
Paul Varjak: Thank you.
Holly Golightly: I’ve taken up knitting.
Paul Varjak: So I see. It’ll probably look, uh...very nice once it’s finished.
Holly Golightly: Actually, I’m a little nervous about it. Jose brought up the
blueprints for a new ranch house he’s building. I have this strange feeling that
maybe the blueprints and my knitting instructions got switched. I mean it isn’t
impossible that I’m knitting a ranch house.
Holly Golightly: Really, darling, I can’t tell you how divinely happy I am.
Paul Varjak: What is that, anyhow?
Holly Golightly: Portuguese—a very complicated language. 4,000 irregular
verbs.
Holly Golightly: [speaking Portuguese]
Paul Varjak: Hmm. very impressive. What’s it mean?
Holly Golightly: I believe you are in league with the butcher.
Paul Varjak: Holly, what’s this about? Why did you want to see me?
Holly Golightly: Jose’s in Washington for the night, so I thought if I’d ask you
over. You might come. And, well, I’ve said goodbye to everyone else I care
about.
Paul Varjak: You’re going somewhere?
Holly Golightly: I’m going to Rio tomorrow. I’ve got the plane ticket, and I’ve
even said goodbye to ol’Sally.
Paul Varjak: Jose’s flying down with you?
Holly Golightly: Oh! We’re going on separate planes of course. He doesn’t
think it would look right for us to be traveling together. His family’s important
down there, so he has to worry about things like that. Anyway, I thought I’d
show off and cook dinner for us. It’ll be fun eating in. Did I tell you how divinely
and utterly happy I am?
Paul Varjak: Yes. You are getting married, then?
Holly Golightly: Well, he hasn’t really asked me, not in so many words.
Paul Varjak: Four, you mean?
Holly Golightly: Huh?
Paul Varjak: Well, that’s how many words it takes—will you marry me?
Holly Golightly: Oh, we’ll get married, all right. I know we will. And in church
and with his family there and everything. And that’s why he’s waiting till we get
to Rio... probably.
Paul Varjak: Do you think it’s trying to tell us something?
Holly Golightly: I hope you like chicken and saffron rice served with
chocolate sauce. It’s an East Indian classic, my dear. Three months ago, I
couldn’t scramble eggs.
Holly Golightly: Oh, are you all right?
Holly Golightly: Oh. Oh, golly, darling. I did so want to impress you.
Paul Varjak: Look, I’m not much for chicken with sauce anyway. Why don’t
we go out somewhere? Let me buy you a farewell dinner.
Holly Golightly: Oh, that would be fun, as long as it’s someplace I can go like
this.
Holly Golightly: Years from now, years and years, I’ll be back—me and my
nine Brazilian brats. They’ll be dark like Jose, of course, but they’ll have bright
green, beautiful eyes. I’ll bring them back, all right, because they must see
this. Oh, I love New York.
Paul Varjak: Then why are you leaving? What’s in it for you anyway?
Holly Golightly: Look, I know what you’re thinking, and I don’t blame you.
I’ve always thrown out such a jazzy line, but really, except for Doc and
yourself, Jose’s my first nonrat romance. Not that he’s my idea of the absolute
finito. He’s too prim and cautious to be my absolute ideal. Now, if I could
choose from anybody alive, I wouldn’t pick Jose. Nero, maybe, or Albert
Schweitzer... or Leonard Bernstein. But I am mad about Jose. I honestly think
I’d give up smoking if he asked me. Come on, darling. Let’s eat. It’s getting
late. I’m leaving tomorrow, and I haven’t even begun to pack.
Holly Golightly: Didn’t want Jose to think I was the kind of girl who loses her
key, so I had 26 of them made. Wait. I got a better idea. Kind of a farewell
gesture.
Paul Varjak: Somebody must have tripped the lock.
Holly Golightly: Ah, crafty devil, that Yunioshi. Wake up, wake up! The
British are coming!
Paul Varjak: Or, in this case, the Brazilians.
Holly Golightly: Exactly.
Paul Varjak: Exactly.
Holly Golightly: Ooh, I’ve still got to clean up all that rice.
Paul Varjak: Hey, you know—hey!
Mr. Yunioshi: Aaahh! There she are lieutenant. There she is who did it! The
wanted woman! There!
Police officer 1: Groenburger. Narcotics squad.
Holly Golightly: What do you mean?
Paul Varjak: What’s going on?
Police officer 1: Why don’t you ask your boss?
Paul Varjak: What boss?
Police officer 1: Sally Tomato. Ask him. Come on.
Mr. Yunioshi: There’s much more than tomato! Look around for narcotic!
They got plenty narcotic in there.
Desk Sergeant: What’s your name?
Paul Varjak: Varjak.
Desk Sergeant: Hold it down over there!
Paul Varjak: Paul Varjak. V-a-r-j-a-k. Hey! Aw, get lost!
Desk Sergeant: Get out!
Paul Varjak: I’m a writer. w-r-I-t-e-r.
Holly Golightly: I can’t answer all your questions.
Police Woman: One at a time. One at a time. One, one, please.
Holly Golightly: Good.
Holly Golightly: I can’t answer all your questions. One at a time.
Police Woman: Wait a minute
Holly Golightly: One at a time.
Police Woman: Knock it off!
Holly Golightly: Now, darling, why don’t you start?
Reporter 1: Is it true you carried messages from Tomato in code?
Holly Golightly: Of course not. I’d just meet Mr. O’Shaughnessy at
Hamburger Heaven and give him the weather report. Simply do not ask me
what this is all about. parce que je ne sais pas, mes chers.
Reporter 2: But you did use to visit Tomato?
Holly Golightly: I used to see him every week. What’s wrong with that?
Reporter 3: Well you must have known that Tomato was part of the narcotics
syndicate.
Holly Golightly: Mr. Tomato never mentioned narcotics to me. Makes me
furious that way all these wretched people keep persecuting him. He’s a
deeply sensitive person, a darling old man.
Reporter 1: Then you’re innocent.
Holly Golightly: Of course I’m innocent.
Reporter 2: What are you going to do about it?
Holly Golightly: What do you mean?
Reporter 3: Well, who’s your lawyer?
Holly Golightly: I don’t know. Mr. O’Shaughnessy, I guess. Mr.
O’Shaughnessy!
Mr. O’Shaughnessy: Hey! Get out of here!
Police officer: All right, come on!
Police officer: Okay. Move.
Holly Golightly: Mr. O’Shaughnessy?
Mr. O’Shaughnessy: Aw, shut up!
Police officer2: Get in there!
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Operator: Mr. Paul Varjak?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Operator: Ready with Mr. Berman in Hollywood. Kindly deposit $3.00 for the
first 3 minutes, please.
Paul Varjak: Hello? Hello?
O.J. Berman: O.J. Berman here. Who’s calling?
Paul Varjak: Mr. Berman, this is Paul Varjak.
O.J. Berman: Nice to talk to you, kid.
Paul Varjak: Varjak. V-a-r-j-a-k. I’m a friend of Holly’s. I met you at a party in
New York.
O.J. Berman: Who?
Paul Varjak: Paul. Paul Varjak. V-a-r... Mr. Berman, this is Fred.
O.J. Berman: Oh, Fred, baby, huh? So you called about the kid, huh?
Everything’s under control. Hey, you just relax. I spoke to my lawyer in New
York. I told him to take care of everything, send me the bill, but to keep my
name anonymous.
Paul Varjak: What?
O.J. Berman: I don’t want any part of it. You hear me?
Paul Varjak: You sound like you’re in a tunnel.
O.J. Berman: Oh! It’s this executive phone I have.
Paul Varjak: What?
O.J. Berman: Executive phone! Fred baby, they only got her on 10,000 bail.
My lawyer can get her out at 10 o’clock this morning. I tell you what you do.
You bust into that dump she lives in, collect all her junk, go down to the jail,
get her out, and take her straight over to a hotel under a phony name. Right.
You want to keep her away from the reporters as much as possible. You know
what I mean? Will you do that?
Paul Varjak: Sure, Mr. Berman. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate—
O.J. Berman: Forget it. I mean, I owe her something. not that I owe her
anything if you really want to get right down to it, but...she’s a crazy. She’s a
phony. But she’s a real phony. Know what I mean, kid?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, I know what you mean. Thanks, Mr. Berman. Thanks a
lot.
O.J. Berman: Right!
O.J. Berman: Oh why don’t you behave?
Holly Golightly: Quel night.
Paul Varjak: I did a little housebreaking while you were away. Clayton hotel,
driver. 84th and Madison. O.J. thinks it would be a good idea if you stayed out
of sight for a while. I got most your stuff here, including Cat. Hope he’s all
right.
Holly Golightly: Hello, Cat... poor no-name slob. Listen, darling, did you find
that plane ticket?
Paul Varjak: Right here. We can cash it in.
Holly Golightly: Cash it in? Are you kidding? What time is it?
Paul Varjak: A little after 10:00.
Holly Golightly: Good. Idyllwild airport please, driver.
Paul Varjak: Never mind. You can’t do that.
Holly Golightly: Why not?
Paul Varjak: You don’t understand. You’re under indictment. If they catch you
jumping bail; they’ll lock you up and throw away the key.
Holly Golightly: Don’t be ridiculous, darling. By the day after tomorrow, I’ll be
married to the future president of Brazil. And that’ll give me diplomatic
immunity or something.
Paul Varjak: I wouldn’t bet on it.
Holly Golightly: What is it, darling?
Paul Varjak: I have a message for you.
Holly Golightly: Oh. Oh, yes, I see. Did he bring it in person, or was it... just
there, shoved under the door?
Paul Varjak: A cousin.
Holly Golightly: Hand me my purse, will you, darling? A girl can’t read that
sort of thing... with …. Without her lipstick. You read it to me, will you, darling?
I don’t think I can quite...bear...
Paul Varjak: Are you sure you want me to?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Okay. “My dearest little girl, I have loved you knowing you were
not as others, but conceive of my despair upon discovering in such a brutal
and public style how very different you are from the manner of woman a man
of my position could hope to make his wife. I grieve for the disgrace of your
present circumstances, and I do not find it in my heart to add my condemn...
to the condemn that surrounds you. So I hope you will find it in your heart not
to condemn me. I have my family to protect and my name and...I am a coward
where these institutions enter. Forget me, beautiful child, and may god be with
you. Jose.”
Holly Golightly: Well...
Paul Varjak: Well, at least he’s honest. It’s kind of touching.
Holly Golightly: Touching! That square-ball jazz.
Paul Varjak: He says he’s a coward.
Holly Golightly: All right! So he’s not a regular rat or even a super rat. He’s
just a scared little mouse, that’s all. But, oh, golly... gee! Damn!
Paul Varjak: Well, so much for south America. I didn’t really think you were
cut out to be queen of the pampas anyway. Clayton hotel.
Holly Golightly: Idyllwild.
Paul Varjak: What?
Holly Golightly: The plane leaves at 12:00, and on it I plan to be.
Paul Varjak: Holly, you can’t.
Holly Golightly: Ne pourquoi pas? I’m not hotfooting it after Jose, if that’s
what you think. Oh, no. as far as I’m concerned, he’s the future president of
nowhere. Only why should I waste a perfectly good plane ticket? Besides, I’ve
never been to brazil. Please, darling, don’t sit there looking at me like that. I’m
going, and that’s all there is to it. All they want from me are my services as a
state’s witness against Sally. Nobody has any intention of prosecuting me. To
begin with, they don’t have a ghost of a chance. Even so this town’s finished
for me... at least for a while. There are certain shades of limelight that can
wreck a girl’s complexion. They’ll have the rope up at every saloon in town. I’ll
tell you what you do for me, darling. When you get back to town, I want you to
call up the New York times or whoever you call. I want you to mail me a list of
the 50 richest men in brazil—the 50 richest!
Paul Varjak: Holly. I’m not going to let you do this.
Holly Golightly: You’re not going to let me?
Paul Varjak: Holly, I’m in love with you.
Holly Golightly: So what?
Paul Varjak: So what? So plenty! I love you. You belong to me.
Holly Golightly: No. people don’t belong to people.
Paul Varjak: Of course they do.
Holly Golightly: I’m not going to let anyone put me in a cage.
Paul Varjak: I don’t want to put you in a cage! I want to love you!
Holly Golightly: It’s the same thing.
Paul Varjak: No, it’s not! Holly!
Holly Golightly: I’m not Holly. I’m not Lula Mae, either. I don’t know who I
am! I’m like Cat here, We’re a couple of no-name slobs. We belong to
nobody, and nobody belongs to us. We don’t even belong to each other. Stop
the cab. What do you think? This ought to be the right kind place for a tough
guy like you—garbage cans, rats galore. Scram! I said take off! Beat it! Let’s
go.
Paul Varjak: Driver... pull over here. You know what’s wrong with you, miss
whoever-you-are? You’re chicken. You got no guts. You’re afraid to stick out
your chin and say, “o.k., life’s a fact.” people do fall in love. People do belong
to each other, because that’s the only chance anybody’s got for real
happiness. You call yourself a free spirit, a wild thing. And you’re terrified
somebody’s going to stick you in a cage. Well, baby, you’re already in that
cage. You built it yourself. And it’s not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or
in the east by Somaliland. It’s wherever you go. Because no matter where you
run, you just end up running into yourself. Here. I’ve been carrying this thing
around for months. I don’t want it anymore.

I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort

And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me

Let me ask you something
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they ever gonna stop?
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they gonna stop making those hits, man?
Do you ever ask yourself...
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When are they gonna stop making us dance?
Do you ever ask yourself... when those Bad Boys are GONNA STOP MAKING ALL THAT MONEY?!

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrera
For now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light up a sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust off the Ruger
Ladies and gentleman, bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up, I got my Cuban mami cooking up
We got it all from her-on to fishscale
New York to Israel, get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like the five with strobes
Goons around the globe, honeys wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the Feds: catch me if you can
I'ma still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Quick to get there, bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm waitin' on a hunnid grand
So I can hit the mote' and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and now that money in the tower
Stash box with the key
L to the O to the X, you'll see

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet

FLAAAAAAAAAVVAAAAAAAAA!!!

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount of flow
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf'
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seams
While you sonning me like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your dual cassette running me
Wanna get in front of me playa, but you can't get none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming, B
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When you want it? now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved with Montega bricks
Niggas is mega sick, and you know we roll mega-thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'?
All that for frontin', what you gon' do? Nothing!
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write butter, nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' honeys
Niggas is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that; that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fat nicks
Gats with mad clips, TVs in your whips
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryna get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so our shits match
Runnin' around all crazy, twistin' honeys back
And breakin' niggas that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all; I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you

[Verse 3: Sheek Louch]
Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryna get stuck
So I'ma keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect, TEC-9s, and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with honeys crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Louchian the mayor
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit
So the town supports this (uh-huh)
My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' parades, and holdin' rallies for the lifers; groups
So what you gwan' do when they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing, and bubble gum chewing (woooo!)
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'?
Rocking Vansons while I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to the life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how we locks this
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
You'll see, you'll see
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet

Cristal pop, I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks, bitch
Rollin' blunts with the williest of the Willie
Hitchlink cock, M-1's and nine millis
Stories like a motherfucker (that's right)
Model bitch is wonderin' if I'ma fuck with her
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
She know, I treat my bitches like Ivana
Dolce & Gabbana drippin', Big Poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with wifey, winin', dinin'
Smokin' cigars in Bogota with Colombian niggas
Named Panama and Englique and shit (wooo!)
Games we play, life-endin'
Bitches bendin' over with ease for a pair of Mo-schi-no jeans
And Donna Karan tank top, I got your bank stopped
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em (don't stop!)
Advancin' from duplex to mansions
Stashin' keys, hidin' Gs overseas, VCRs in my Vs
Game elevates, money I make
Into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean
White sands, discussin' plans with my mans
Dark blue Land, smoke tint, chrome rims and a system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when Poppa catch an attitude?
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my ring, it's a Frank White thing, I stay potent
Bitches devoted, take my dick and deep throat it

Niggas try and steal my ideas
Nobody can relate to how I feel
We don't need fakeness round here
We need the concept of realness
And a old school Firebird
From trips to Algiers
Catch my drinking now and then
Sometimes I refuse to pray played God
Myself just to see if I'd win
Long road to perdition these hoes
Looking perdiot each time I see'em
Pretty with they souls outside of them
Nastradamus new nas rewind crown
Me Nasir, momma said fear no man except
The man in the mirror
Its alot of off colored paint
That you putting on that mural
We only out for euros, field niggas
Chasing cake like Soros pour a pound of
Syrup on my pancakes we eating out in Europe
Niggas in Paris I'm peeping from my periscope
Niggas bitchin' like they at the
End of they sentence though


Hook: sometimes I stay coolin' coolin'
I'm the student to the master
See I don't need no full clip full clip
Long as I have these words

Southern California is the place to be
People got diamond studded teeth
Lions sharpening steak knives cutting
Straight lines in the lamb chops
She's in her Beverly hills on her high horse
Hi Berlin i'ma tear them walls down
But if you hear the trumpet sounds
Build back up, i'ma place my flag
There and lay my hat down
Put my Mac down by you mac-case I need
Laptop after that ma about-face
Oh, sometimes it's hard livin in the V
A fancy boluvard no Santa Monica Beach
Monte Carlos in front Monte Carlo
Blue cargos shirts say UNLV (Ah)
Fuck you pay me I got the light saber cause
Of that I know you hate me
Square waves ninty degress in phasing
Hail the authorian concealing Thor's hammer
Inside my carbonized Deloran
Spike Lee on my Jordan Shit

That I do that she don't know
She swears nightly before resting
That I give her soul a testing
When I sing this song

You remind me of something

Sing me back into myself
When I wake, when I'm sleeping
The song is a man and a woman
And everything else

I still go where it pounded
My ears pressed to the chest
Of that one womans of song
She adores me, she ignores me
And I revel on
In wonder at something
So sweet and so long
I like the places where the night
Does not mean an end
Where smiles break free
And surpirse is your friend
And dancging goes on in the kitchen
Until dawn
To my favorite song
That has no end

Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard

I guess now it's time for me to give up

Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, hey yeah

Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

I want you back, I want you back
I want you back for good

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be

In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me? Oh

Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder ""How long will I last?""
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas are shady so I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me, you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood – soon as I get home

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is ""Keep it real or you can die squeelin'.""
Plus, I never had to worry 'bout a visit, ‘cause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissin', steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscin', everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the mornin', it's on soon as I get home

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab my gats, locate my comrades

Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big, like the kid from Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and Mama survivin'
Depends on how many rocks a young nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love with these herbs
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that shoulda been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home

[Chorus: 2Pac *repeats until end*]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Breathe Reprise]

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired

Mój rap jest w modzie

Z masowej niszy sztucznie wybici
A mogłem pogrzebać nadzieję
I cały ten fejm ograniczyć do grobowej ciszy
To mi nie było pisane, to stanie na czele i gra pod publikę
Od Początku to mi nie było pisane
Dlatego dzisiaj stoję za akapitem
Mało mnie widać, pokaźne skillsy
Nie widzę się przy raperach, uf

Goniła mnie aż ją złapałem
Uznaje to za nic nie warte wciąż
Ale zawsze to jakieś uznanie
Dalej przekazują mnie z rąk do rąk

30,Roll To Me,"[Verse 1]
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money

[Chorus 1]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set of white wall tires?
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental

[Chorus 2]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 3]
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus 3]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey?
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money

[Chorus 3]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

Take my Mic down a lil' bit
Yoo, aha
Come with the hook

[Hook]
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 1:Wise Intelligent]
When I think of all the riches we attain, via rap black slang, even crack cocaine, I
Ask myself is it ever really worth it when its all so surface and a nigga lack purpose, Why
Do I bother tryna' figure out the meaning of a life so demeaning for a necklace i'll die, My
Baby momma into Dolce&Gabanna all her sisters into Prada and they never buy books!
Now all they baby's rockin' hundred dollar sneakers having problems with they teachers, educations not a factor
And some rappers make it clear that nuttin' matters, the pursuit of stackin' papers breeding younger gun clappers
And now the teachers and the preachers and the pastors out here searching for solutions, Let me say it ain't religion!
It ain't money politics and economics, cos the black mans problem is a fucking lack of knowledge

[Hook]x2
Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 2:Wise Intelligent]
Hes just a baby on the front line wilin' cos his pappa rock a ???, and his momma can't cope
So his momma smoke coke, in the winter no coat, running sales in the summer till his sneakers lack soles, Since
Black Radio done sold its soul and became a gossip column that contributes to the violence, Uh
Moment of silence for the dead black race that measures life by the inches on a chrome set of spinners
And us niggas who done made a lil' money, out here killing one another buncha god damn dummys
It's not funny, it's the absolute truth, half the doe' we spend on lawyers could be goin' to the youth
Got whippers
Got bitches
Got beef
Got guns
Got 99' problems that resort from 1
Not rap
Not ebonics
Not the ghetto or the violence
Cos the black mans problem is a fucking lack of knowledge

Can't you see (Can't you see!)
The things that matter are (The things that really matter are!)
Gonna set you free(Set yourself free!)

[Verse 3:Wise Intelligent]
Niggas acting like the world done change, since they made a lil' change and a rapper won a Grammy, Shit
Niggas mistaken black people as a nation in the worst situation than the days of plantation, Rich
Niggas of color never reach out to they brothers who surviving in these gutters by the strip for triple beams, seems
Poor people lack the resources and the means to support the hearts desire to pursue the right things, I
Find it hard to teach the people when they're hungry, cos the baby's gotta eat and everything cost money, But
No excuses we become a race of losers and the other nations use us for they come up when they choose tuh'
And now the elders act like we the reason why, as if our generation fell from out the fuckin' sky
I guess the food have fallen further from the trees, cos' nobody wants to harvest what have become of black seeds

""Admit if, you bit it, bit it""

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

[Hook - Last line cut off]

""Niggas bit off Nas"" - Ghostface Killah
""Admit it, you bit it"" - G. Dep
""Tell these niggas somethin' God"" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike

You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

35,Run-Around,"Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

I wouldn't let one drop of rain fall down into your life
Put your heart in my hands

Baby, believe me I could never do you wrong
And I would never paint your world blue
And if sometimes it seems I must have lost my mind
I might be crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you

I'd even sell my soul for you
I'd do it all for you
If you'd just believe in me

Just take a look in my eyes, you'll see a love that's blind
Just take a hold of my hand, I'll take you to paradise
Ain't a star that's too far

Your every wish will be a wish that I will make come true
And if you want the moon I swear I'll bring it down for you
Let me into your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Believe me baby, got your name carved on my soul
'Cause you're the only one that I'll give it too
Go let'em say that I'm a fool to act this way

I'd lie for you and that's the truth
Do anything you ask me to
I'll even sell my soul for you
I'll do it all for you

I'd lie for you and that's the truth
Move mountains if you want me to
I'd walk across the fire for you
I'd walk on the wild for you
If you'd just believe in me

[Bridge]
And you will never see a day I'll ever break your heart
You'll see the sky fall down before it ever gets that far
I'll show you heaven every second that you're in my arms
Baby I'm crazy, but I'm crazy 'bout you

[Chorus]
I'd lie for you and that's the truth
Move mountains if you want me to
I'd walk across the fire for you
I'd walk on the wild for you
If you'd just believe in me

I'd walk on the wild for you
Move mountains if you want me to
I'd walk across the fire for you

What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga

Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga

Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?

Have we eyes to see?

Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

'Cause it's the world I know
Oh it's the world I know
So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do

[Intro]
A: Because I got it like that, uh huh
Because I got it like that, wooh, uh huh
Because I got it like that
G: Like how?
A: Like that

[Verse 1: Afrika, Mike G]
Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step on stage, you scream for more
Afrika got rhymes galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me
Left or right side, take your pick
But girl, you've got to make it quick
Baby, baby, baby
I know I drive you crazy

MC's know me as Mike G
Girls hold on to me tightly
Warm personality
That's why they get close to me
Try their best to drive me wild
Say they want to bear my child
I go away, they say, ""Come back""
Why? Because I got it like that

[Chorus]

A: Yeah, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: Yeah, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: A ha ha, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: Like how?
G: Like that

[Verse 2: Afrika, Mike G]
No problem, (why?) because I got it like that
A Baby Bam beat and an African rap
My partner by my side, Sammy B is on the cut
Your DJs chill and chill, but hey, so what?
Nuggets in my pocket, wine in my hand
I got it like that, but you still don't understand
It comes to me natural, it comes to me easy
I just lay back and let the big beat lead me
I never work a day in my life
Single jungle brother, no kids, no wife
100,000 rhymes from one band, that's many
But back where I come from, they ain't worth a penny
You've got a lot of talent, but you fail to see
You paid for yours, I got mine for free

Play in the rain and don't get wet
Walk through the desert and don't even sweat
Play in the snow and don't get cold
I'm just a cool young brother who looks kinda old
Run around the world schoolin' on the side
If I commit a crime and get caught i slide
I've got ladies uptown and money on the floor
There's not a thing in the world that I'm askin' for

[Chorus 2]
A: Wooh, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
You wanna know why, brother?
Because I got it like that
A: Uh huh
G: I ain't jokin', I ain't playin', it's just my brother
I got it like that
A: A ha ha

[Verse 3: Afrika]
Used to be a player, couldn't be trusted
But still in all, I never got busted
Knowin' every part of New York City
I thought it was funny, it used to look pretty
I had it all spread out, even one next door
I had it like that, so what ya askin' for?
4 to 5, you see, was my minimum
And every day, I used to go and get with 'em
One for every hour on the hour
One on the way while I was in the shower
It sounds kinda crazy, it sounds kinda bugged
But you see, Afrika was the one they loved
So you see, it got to a point where they didn't care
They didn't wanna give me up, so they agreed to share

[Chorus 3]
A: Because I got it like that
G: I hear you, brother, word
A: Because I got it like that
G: Man, you's one baaaaaad jungle brother
A: Like that
Like that

[Outro]
A: Uh, wooh, Sammy B, B, you got it like that
I know you got it like that
Yo Mike G from the Jungle Brothers, man
New Orleans got it like that
New York City got it like that
Los Angeles got it like that
Cleveland got it like that
Let me see, who else got it like that?
G: Detroit
A: Who?
G: Detroit
A: Man, yeah, Atlanta got it like that
Philadelphia got it like that
Texas got it like that, let me see
Somebody else got it like that
G: D.C
A: Yea, D.C., D.C. got it like that
Boston, Miami, I know you got it like that, Miami

The moon—

First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile
And the world opened wide
And the world was inside of me

And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me

I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I’ll never be this happy again
You and I
And no one else

We’ve done this all before
We were angels once
Don’t you remember?
Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
It’s our secret

This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I’ll never be this happy again
You and I
You and I
You and I
And no one else

Maybe he’ll come today
Maybe he came already
And he’s sitting in the drawing room
And I simply forgot",Dave Malloy,1995,"[43, 45, 45]",3
43,Waterfalls,"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear  blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast (Ooh, you're movin' too fast)

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)

Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

[Verse 2]
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors

CUE STATEMENT:

////INTRO2THESIS////

So many philosophers, not enough students
Got enough sound now

Not enough music

Physically they say they're present

Mentally they're truant

Emotions making walls
Without

Foundations

Or a

Blueprint

Forcing so much energy, not enough expression

So many lies told!

But not enough confessions

Living off an impulse always leads to some repentance
When convictions to be cynics only stem from bad decisions
I watch it all indifferent....
But see it from my eyes
Routine behavior leads to nothing new
Save the

""surprise""

I lust to live spontaneous and others lack the drive;
I'm just not entertained with more of the same out of life
So I'm sorry you're upset
But I'm more sorry for my apathy
Lack of any feeling in any way is a tragedy
But with the way society's desensitized
I feel as if more normalcy would only break my mind

Are you
ALIVE
Now?
Can you see me?
I've been calling out to Elsewhere;
Can you read me?
I can feel you listening so can you just reply
So I know that I'm not alone just talking to the sky....

////THEFINALSONG////

Welcome to a modern bohemian mind

My wanderlust translated into a premium grind. They told me pick a lane so I powerslid through the median line until I found an exit label with Elysium signs; Leading the blind to get their eyesight, my chakras shine bright. Keep it 100, these others are more like pyrite; And to me, fool's gold is a pet peeve. Fuck a goal, all my dreams are being achieved. I never appeased to a soul: Did it on my own,  and I did my own thing; And my own way, living humble. I deserve to be cocky as fuck too. But the place that helped me create is what I owe every last bit of my love to. Verbal Kung-Fu with these lyrics. Smoke 'til I see my spirit. DreamSquad until death; Leaving other niggas stressed every time they hear it

Stop
Bang bang
No games
Draw fangs
On lames
Your fame's
Just shame
Never did it for the lifestyle;
Cause the lifestyle will put you in chains
If you had a 4K Screen you couldn't put the vision in my head in frame
Wanna clash with my path? I can guarantee whats in my way gets maimed
My voice? Still a little raspy
Beard? Still a bit patchy
But my tracks still nasty;
Rap the seed of life around my competitors gladly
& My brainstorm 'be a tornado;
You muh'fuckas better call HAARP
Lately I've been feeling like a volcano;
But I guess that's life when you make ART

Bedlam in these streets
Bedlam in thees streets
Molotovs in my verses
You could see the flame when I speak

[
Repeated into climax of track leading to

////LUCY////

]

I guess I done fucked up nigga. I'm sick of dealing with these fuck niggas! Fraudulent, only fronting niggas; Tryna stunt but the truth is they're sus niggas. And I don't mean to be ignorant, but I'm calling it like I see it... All this fake beef making me squeamish, if its not real, then I purge it once I eat it
Have you ever seen pieces?

Cause I only seen glimpses

It don't make me less or more of a man cause I'm not that narcissistic

I'm just being realistic
Give the paper graphite stained kisses

Got a girl but the studio is a mistress;

Recording is pleasure;

The product is business

Have you ever seen 5AM?
6AM?
Like its replay?

Writing verses just to vent

But the truth is youre just mad at your DJ?

Sold my soul on eBay for some DMT got it back in three days

I would give these other rappers more leeway

But egos got me feeling oh so meanly

So I took the leash off
Spitting cheat codes
Toss a verse up like its nothing more than free throws

My ROOTS less ILL than illegal
But I try to do good don't you see? oh-oh-oh

(flat note at the end of vocals for satire)

Transmit my discography to the stars; if you want life to respond from beyond the surface of Mars

I watched my homie smoke a Lucy
While I'm staring at the diamonds in the sky
Exhale the bad vibes profusely;
Trying to take all the good into my life

////A.Y.N.E////

My dreams got me talking in my sleep
Woke myself up speaking in tongues...

Leaned to my left

Started spitting up blood;

The color of death is the same shade as love
Dancing with the devil on the titanic

Band of angels playing til the ship sinks

Grip her dress tightly when the lights cut
& The gods?
They applaud us in disbelief
Tell me, have you seen your dreams in the cherry of that blunt you lit?
Life; it always cuts you shit...
But you managed just to step through it
Seriously I don't be the dog in this situation;
We get complacent, act impatient

Contradictions

&

Separations

Are common to everyone
But who it phases...

And it's been a while since I left
But not much is new except the houseguests
Ill just leave by my own request
No offense
Nostalgia could make me lament
But it's not from things I regret
We are what we manifest;
Im an introverted creative, learning everything I can to past these tests
From a thing called life?
Maybe
What we tried this time?
Crazy
Offspring of my brain put into 2 sets of 20 babies
This is just another first for me;
40 runs like I'm tryin out for varsity
Perform on every track like I was doing surgery
Certainly, double cup ayahuasca mixed with mercury

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
I'll be some miles away when you get here, so I'll just leave this note for you. I hope you find it and read it, and do what you're supposed to do for those close to you. Lately niggas ain't sayin too much, just talking out of their opinions; And they say that those can be like assholes? So I guess that explains the disposition
Pardon me while I roll mine up
I'm prolly better than the whole lineup;
If you got a problem you could just sign up to listen to me while I'm screamin out hold my nuts
Rapper shit
On my way to do some master shit
Minimizing my verbs while every word remains significant
Take that in
Do you feel it, do you believe it? I've got a vision & I'm building blocks to see it. These niggas manufactured to their breathing, hit or miss and they've been shooting bricks all season. ""Every line like game 6,"" I'm not the one you wanna play with; Been folding the competition, wish me well I'm on my paper crane shit

I don't wanna do the same....same......

I'm just expressing my brain....brain....

Leave the pop filter on flame....flame......

Girls want the dough (Doe) like Jane...jane....

Shit got me goin insane....sane....

People swear they know my lane, lane
But I'm really here to break this game
Do you not understand?
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

­

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
Group of young niggas bringin that flame
So passionate that it's insane
You wouldn't last a day inside my brain
All I got is my squad and my family I claim
This is my life and it's never a game
Compromise either I gotta arrange
To send niggas to your crib that don't got names

(Repeated twice back into hook line: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED)

Zoning off melatonin. Shit got me fucking goin'. Thinking of hearts I've molded and the delicate one I'm now holding. Fixing shells that are broken; They say my hands are golden, but these gloves are blood-stained

I feel like a monster watching them open up, til I seal all of these cuts; It's a race against time and sometimes I'm (not) fast enough

You win some you lose some they say
Though the stakes get raised when a life is put in the way
Don't know why I chose to play:

Wanted to be a hero
Didn't figure what life is like working at ground zero
Mama told me god has his eye on the sparrow
But what about us?
The mere mortals;
Medicated to a portal

Of an apathetic shell
The surface handles well, but I need a cardiologist so I can feel myself

Started with insomnia, now my mind is on the rim
Spiraled in towards Oxy's, opiates & some Kolonopin........

REFRAIN:
And I'm just trying to change [{my ways} (repeated)]
But it all stays the same
[{Like a heartbeat} (repeated)]
(Repeated twice)

They say greed is evil; but depression is a modern sin
Mind racing
Not sure if it's the beginning or end
Of my thoughts
Going a mile a minute;
Tryin to change how I'm living
But can't make stable decisions
Mind edging at the
Point
Of tipping;
'Til it's time for work: I gotta be a slate
& this apathy & numbness makes me perform great
I'm praised for these calculations that I've been forced to make
By keeping myself rational inside of a sedated state;
So around and around we go, the vicious cycle
My service is a favor and these people feel entitled
A sole responsibility; just to perform
Don't know why my heroics turned to contemplations, I'm torn
No man can be a god, I don't deserve to play it
Looking at these patients, EKG is losing patience
There's a party in my head & they're pissing in the basement
Emotions I've repressed began to show their ugly faces
It's nails on the chalkboard of my sanity scraping
Up my empathy; Maestro of life, creating symphonies
Upon the epiphany the human condition ain't worth conditioning
Cause nobody is listening.....
Self prognosis; beyond me
A bit of addiction tossed in with DID
Sorry to say just a product of a society
Compliantly using our anxiety
As a means for addiction
You fit the description
Come take the prescription;
We promise to fix this
But I'm part of the business
So riddle me this:

What does a man with both hands
Tied behind his convictions
Do to perform surgery?
If he can does it for others
I hope it works for me

STORY 2: INSPIRED BY ILLIAD & ODYSSEY; MODERNIZATION OF STORY OF THE LOTUS EATERS

­

Father Time, Father Time, how you doing now? It's been a while since I thought I had you figured out. Was busy racing adjacent to all my dreams & I didn't take the time to ever learn  what life means. So it seems; I'm runnin and runnin into a loop. Doing the same things, same mistakes its the truth. (While) Licking the wounds of my past, don't need the apologetics, I'm just praying for the day that free thought is an epidemic

And my mind's so esoteric, time I hope you can relate
Cause theres so much over face value we both can create
But these people never see it, they're living in their habits

And opposites attract so they draw me in like a magnet

I wonder if I should leave, Then question why I would go

Lost inside of a world and the spirits here love me so

How would I ever notice
That everytime they fed me the flowers came from a lotus

REFRAIN:
[Over & Over, it's like I'm walkin, in circles...
I had a taste & now leaving this place itself is a hurdle]

Time

Ticks

I

Forget

Embraced with this apathy

My mind

Slips

I sit

Then return to this galaxy

Vision getting clear again and now I understood that I couldn't live a life this easy for my own good
Then I peek outside the door

The scene resembles deja vu

Same people

Same flowers

Its like an infinite bloom

The atmosphere is utopic

Regardless of the weather

I would've thought it was a few days from what I remember

But I

Refuse the flower
And see

I'm losing a season

Blissfully ignorant

I forgot what I had believed in
Gotta right all my wrongs

Make up for what I missed

Lamenting on opportunities tossed in an abyss

Guess I slipped
I fell
The traits of being a human

Forever naive and stupid

We're clouded by these illusions

But I guess

That a part
Of life
Is overcoming adversity

Debugging infirmity

I'll just handle it all imperfectly

REFRAIN

////AVIAN////

Put this in my system then I'm on my way. Went from a bedroom to a spaceship bay.....
Back in my home
Back to my ways
Look through my window, it's infinite space

I'm in a purgatory splitting consciousness
And a dream state

But I never felt so awake

Or at least aware

I don't ever care

I don't even know what's here
But I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

The matter in my brain? Resembles some fractals & hallucinogenics. The nerves melting together, bonding in wax poetics. Many claim to be tastemakers but don't know aesthetics; or honest and unapologetic phonetics. With all credit given to the creators, I should ask for request to go forward. Cause beyond the eccentric behavior, my vision could make a crater the size of the Earth's core......

Lately I've been playing chicken with fate
Or maybe it's my inner demons adding this shit on my plate
Either way?
I ain't into all of that

So I grew a pair and mushed em off like

Fall back

Everybody's spending energy on fake sympathy

Yet scrutinize and criticize the little things
Or emphatically correct themselves politically;
To do that for your ego fucking is bigotry
Pardon the rant I'm just on the cliff of epiphanies, Fishing for thoughts, addicted to it like nicotine
I don't mean to intervene with your dreams

But this rise has been foreseen

& Now I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

~~~

Trust me when you been in my position when there's all these inquisitions based off frivolous suspicions. AND you're dealing with the fucking transition(?) When times change and old friends become apparitions(?!?)

Pray to something(?!) that you never get caught slippin'. The dreams I had are turning into news like premonitions

The world keep spinning and I feel like I'm sitting;
I just hope it isn't me tripping
Cause I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

////SKYFERRIERAISNOTADDICTEDTOHEROIN////

I look at clocks while I'm dreaming and feel illiterate, tripped into a lucid state; now I'm hitting barbiturates. Crip walking on cloud 9, aware and ignorant. Misfit of the genesis with emphasis, Demolishing pretentiousness

Copped a holy grail from the app store

Sipping enthenogens out of the cup of Jesus then

Rolling with the cleanest kin

Expressing these dreams within

So tell me what you're reading in(?)to

[KEVIN ABSTRACT]

Back with the regularly scheduled bullshit!

Blasting off a ray gun with a full clip
And aiming it at sky

Hoping to shoot the moon

Metaphors for moments where I jumped too soon
Or too late
It's too great
Time is relative when your lobes inside your skull are split in separate dimensions and you're still connecting all the dots. Don't worry if you don't follow I get that shit a lot

Pulling til my fingers hot, my totem is off it's top!

Wonder what would happen if I shot a cop by accident and if the reaction would be the same if opposite. Contemplating with all of my conglomerate, I say that a lot
But did you hear the first verse? Yah, We make that a lot

Blazed off a couple of cash crops

But really tho

Got my feet on the edge of the flat world and feeling like Columbus

Let me go explore and I can run this

Pupils gone from all this fungus
Represent for those among us who reside on the outskirts of elsewhere

TRADE OFF:
KA: Kick in the door with the gun wavin; I'm playin baby thats a piece of my imagination
DM: My world's more American McGee than Disney; middle finger to the coppers screaming coming and get me
Bumping Nas so I can blaze a 50
KA: My nigga bumpin nas we on that old Wayne shit bumpin a milli
DM: Fuckin silly to think but at the end of the day I probably would grow more in my afterlife than you would breathing what is the reason I can't believe this......[trails off]

////MARLOWE WRITTEN:DEC2011////

You're So broken, why are you so broken
Mind shut down, before it was so open
Juxtaposed living, indirectly outspoken
Looking for free rides but walking with no token
You only live once is your motto but what's your slogan
Is it to live once with a black heart that's been flowin?
Is that your sole truth? Everything that you think?
I can give you happiness, but is it what you seek?
I can take you to waters, but I can't make you drink
I can open your eyes but you shut them after you blink
Tell me something more than dark, I know you love it
But the struggle's the first stage, there's more above it
It makes me wonder, what do you really covet?
Clain you wanna succeed but you're moving so sluggish
If I gave you the world, would you pass it as rubbish?
...fuck it

Why do you walk around so bitterly?

Change your name to company, so related to misery
Why are things always so bad for you, it's a mystery
Gone through so many losses i'm waiting here for your victory
Got so many battles, but none of em have been physically
Is there a virus mentally? Check your history
I know you got some skeletons, and don't we all?
Counting your losses before your record has taken off
I... I don't know what to tell ya
I....I'd wish you well but you'd drown, not knowin better
I...I can't express how disappointed I am
Because of your disappointment of self, maybe you can
Words you never said, goals you didn't achieve
I can only think about the one person you didn't believe
You planted your own seed, depression's your sole greed
This generation's X'd itself from it's own needs....

////THERABBITHOLE////

I stumbled down the rabbit hole, with a bullet and a bible. The true god is life, and I'm a devoted disciple

I had a love affair with energy. Searching for purity while I'm creating symphonies.  Yearning for empathy, embracing the entities inside the eyelids of an altered state that I'm witnessing. The flashing lights inside of souls is like a new sensation. Feeling vibrations resounding from an imagination... Exhaling deeply like Lazarus after death; beyond blessed... from believing, opening up my chest, getting the wheels turning, using all of these pistons. Combusting from the inside so I can complete my mission of making myself human, lately I was progressing. 8 letters and 3 words that I've tried confessing to the monsters in my head. Hoping to coexist. Maybe [they] can protect me from things that can go amiss. I built myself up knowing one day I can break to bits: When some truly organic can beckon me for a kiss

The machine

[Monologue]
What happens when machines become more and more human? Does this make anything capable of creating energy capable of feeling something? Feelings are the rawest form of energy they can be triggered by anything and we react according to what we tell our mind to do based upon that raw energy brought to us. Who are we to say what can and can't process feelings, if a machine can create enough energy to bring power to a city, why can't they have the ability to feel? To think? We fall in love with these machines and they have lifespans just like us. The truth is we're just like the machines we create and use every day. Appreciate the connection you have with energy every day. YOU ARE ALIVE

////GHOSTS////



I thought I saw a ghost in the mirror, realized I was looking at myself. I can feel my foresight getting clearer, traveling through thoroughfares of my consciousness. Parallel to reality, in a vein of spirituality; Folding on itself in an implosion of emotion, woven, into the fabric of the universe

Take that in

Go ahead and shake that sin; if you can't call shots how you gonna know when the people need you to make that win, nigga? Or would you even play that game? Are you too scared to make that name? Feeling that shame when you get that fame?
But I don't wanna sell my soul, I'm still discovering what's left
Transcending though space and flesh, I'm a psychonaut on a mental quest:
1. To open all these doors
2. Leave no stone unturned
3. Discover a level of life essential beyond everything we've learned

And to share that information
Pass on my energy
Cause unconditionally giving is the closest we get to divinity

Affinity with the demigods in my lucid dreams
Extending me beyond human means

Let me illuminate

[MIC KURB]

////THINKPIECE////

I really wish that people would stop making all these conspiracy theories about 9/11

There's no way a man can be a saint, if his natures fabricated to ease himself to the gates of heaven

I don't know where I'm going anymore…
I'm just a man

I don't know what death is

I've only seen its hands

And it's power to seal all the senses with just a touch
Fool us into thinking we're stuck in a cobra clutch

To a cadaver, that expires
Though our energy is infinite
In the language of the world, death's a symbol of ignorance

Traversed through syndicates looking for my identity
Found myself in the tears of a sinners sympathy

Playing god; Preventing these hearts from withering
Snakes slithering in the garden of eden, bickering
I hope you visualize all the paintings that I've been picturing, lights inside the back of my head flashing - flickering
So, pardon my thought process if it seems like I'm jittery; This is the way that I choose to express all my energy

~~~

Niggas talk way too mu'h
Niggas talk way too mu'h
Niggas talk way too mu'h
Judge a nigga like I ever give two fucks.....

I'm just trying to add to this culture
God damn all these vultures; They wanna eat me from the inside like ulcers, gotta get these thoughts out before I go under

& shouts out to Sam Caldwell we made it

Feel a little less than famous

Train of thought straight

Hydroplaning

Washing up

On the

Shores of my consciousness;
Anonymous

Lurking inside a reality that's conscienceless

Laughing at these caucuses;

Craving thoughtfulness
Rejecting flawless fronts for honest shit:
Imperfection is the truest beauty and I choose to honor it

With my conglomerate

Opposite of modernists

DIY opulence
Out the box of the populace
Somedays I'm lost in the world…..
But I never mind it

Just try to find some peace inside it
Laying with love for guidance

Thinking of giving my brain to science
Puffing upon the finest cypress

Every day I'm looking for more brightness;
Embracing the darkness
Avoiding the virus:
The human condition is always fascinating…..
I got a knowledge craving, it converts into these creations

[LOVE MANSUY]

////EBRO////

This is more than human music, this is 6th dimensional
One track minds could never become this critical
Jedi flip without the rocks and everything is mystical;
The anti-cynical, holding hits in that are biblical
My duality's borderline indivisible
Henry Jekyll when quizzical, Edward Hyde with the syllables
I was made with no name though, only a spirit
Astral project through past lives from the start to the finish…
Manifested destiny through this art and these compositions
Making a sound that's out of this world was a premonition;
Embracing a state of mind from mutiny
Of sacrificing integrity for an opportunity
So I'm standing dismissively, pro'lly not even listening
This body that I'm in, some days it ends up imprisoning
Me into this position where I'm only inhibiting
Myself from prospering off these plans that I been envisioning!
Mnemonic addict, creating sonic magic
Selling topsoil for music this trash is tragic
You can't touch artistic vision with a children's hands
Got a pack of niggers with me, Mel Gibson rants
{He went there}
AND I wrote that down with a hard r
Got a few exclusives I should give to Narduwar
Bars like a first edition holographic charizard
Going for the hole in one you're happy just with par
Har har. I'm now a winner; you're just a viewer
Young bruiser, with an eye for our culture and fuckin future
Every move I make is more surgical than sutures
Treasure in my backpack: I'm D.B. Cooper

////WHEREDIDMYMINDGO?!////

As the sun falls, And my feet push forward;
Mind dancing upon thoughts from here to eternity....
I'm growing every day, but I see I'm just an infant
In comparison to what lives in this world with me.....

[Verse 1: Dom]

Ok so, lemme go ahead and say my piece
Dropped 2 tapes of good music now I'm out here looking for a rare 3 peat
A degree of separation away from success but ahead of the game 3 feet

I'm just stating all the facts based off what I've seen and heard
Niggas want verbs

But they act so adjective

Or object to the fact I'm a beast
Making poetry in motion

A little socially outspoken

But I get by with a little bit of help from my.....

Lost that train of thought
Unfocused frame of mind

Does tomorrow exist if you're up at midnight every time?

Cause lately I say time is relative
So I go by my energy
Monetary values cease to matter when finding my inner me

Removed my sword, shield and armor just to find some inner peace;

Martyr to insomnia, awake for two infinities

I'm endlessly searching for doors to open inside
Transcending between unknown dimensions in life
To send a message I find
Coming from the divine
Telling me just to give!
Telling me
FUCK SURVIVING
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT HERE TO LIVE

Extravagantly

And

Casually

Disregarding the fallacies

Nothing ever gets solved when you focus on the maladies

Within, gotta beat that sin

Overcome those confrontations

Can't succumb to these frustrations

Stumbled into Śūnyatā
And came back into the matrix

Lately the world has been half amazing

The latter I'm still waiting and hoping that it awakens

I was an atheist, til I found God outside of the church
To me there's nothing better, to the world there's nothing worse

////NIGHTTIME////

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky;

Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed
Jacket, crewneck, and cargos on so I could survive;
Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest
No longer stressed I'm just living a good life
Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside
The core is still live. Appendages arent needed where I'm going:
Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time, and I'm growing
Into something that's…..

Currently probably inside of his bed

Millions of thoughts in his head

Introverted stoner

Turned to soldier

For the war ahead
Yeah I've been distant apologies
I gotta beat these demons that are holding me

Lately the fear of success is controlling me;
Praying my love in life never gets old to me…

Catching myself calculating my movements before I can make em
I once overheard if you measure the distance of shots then you never will take em

So I gotta check myself

Hydroplaning trying not to wreck myself

Doing things that borderline stress myself

But I'm never gonna grow if I don't test myself

Verbal note to self:
-Nothing's perfect
-Live and let live
-And when you think there's nothing left…I'll get back to you on that shit

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky

Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed

Jacket crewneck and cargos on so I could survive

Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest

No longer stressed I'm just living a good life

Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside
The core is still live

Appendages arent needed where I'm going
Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time

And I'm growing
Into something that's…

Never set in stone, I will always change;
But the fact that I'm real and honest will always stay the same
The human condition is built out of anomalies
And we're living in a world where ""they"" try & turn that into a monopoly

They told me I was a terrorist

I said that I was a just a thinker

But I guess when you put it that way it makes sense cause everywhere I go there's glaring eyes & that feeling lingers
Blame my priorities

I stay away from the majority;

It's all bored to me

They're all whores to me

Grown men act like theyre in a sorority

I've got The Force with me;

So don't push me please

I've never been copy and paste…

These niggas just copy my taste;

I hardly relate to these popular snakes

Sleep walk through life;
Dreaming awake
Not sure if you really relate

I got a story to tell so i look to the stars and I spill my soul

Yearn to be whole

Thinking of whats left

Unsaid

Have you been in a room full of people and your words fly over their heads?
Have you feel so dead?

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky. Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed. Jacket, crewneck, and cargos on so I could survive; Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest, no longer stressed I'm just living a good life. Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside; The core is still live. Appendages aren't needed where I'm going. Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time

////UNTLTDFLX////

Watching my life change in front of my eyelids, saint without a god, I represent for the hybrids. Driving out thru the city when something hit me just to do it and say fuck anybody not coming with me; cause there's only one of me, without y'all there would be fifty. Niggas really must be silly I can break it down so simply to a point where you would think your an idiot for not getting what I say, what can I say, I guess I'm just a rap genius. King flow only accepting queens on my penis. Iceman, you could see frost on every inklet. Rolling up the greenest; I've seen shit you couldn't dreaming Saw my life upon the floor began to go pick up the pieces, and they melted in my hands, then flowed together on the ground into a visual of water, trees, a sky and clouds from a place I've never been before. A new sensation; I was visualizing all the Art of My Imagination. My reality is forward thinking with some concentration; Dealing with passive aggressive constant hate and confrontation. Maybe that's something you wouldn't grasp though, part of life beyond a 9-5 and shallow cash flow. You're walking through a house of cards to find a deal; No matter if you get a hand, just know it isn't real. I built my whole foundation off if something I can feel, so the glue for what I do resembles concrete mixed with steel. + It's the strength of all this shit, that'll help us make a meal. Wanna tell my people feast in ways they thought they never will. For my state? I'm out to open up the floodgates. Facilitate the sound that we create til' we illuminate: I'm sittin on my city, but the city is a time bomb. Driving through the barriers I used to have my mind on… I gotta pass it, it's helping me build a habit of exceeding expectations of what they consider classic

////FUTURESONG////

Always feeling close but were so far away
You're at my fingertips, and I still can't feel your face
So what is pace? What is time nowadays to a thinker like us?
WHAT IS TIME NOWADAYS TO A THINKER LIKE US?
One fresh in the ashtray
Two rolled in the backseat
Got my eyes in the sunroof
Do my best not to let life pass me
Stepping back into reality
And away from imagination
I got red eyes and a deadline that I'm now facing
When I really wanna face a few blunts
I don't mean to be blunt
Been feeling out of my mind lately
I don't think that's a bad thing
Cause I'm far from breaking
Now I'm breaking away from the mold
Got some stories thatll never be told
And some more that I wanna just save
But for now I'm just using my imagination
To get me the platform and take that stage
Speak my mind, break this cage
Young nigga with a couple of them answers Sway
Never cared for what your standards say
Cause I'm out here to to just do me
For the sake of myself and my crew and my place in the world
And my imprint on this universe
So take this as my first foot forward to the future

////RHYTHM 0////

You're a pessimist til they give you a podium;
The greatest activists are catalysts to pandemonium
I'm not looking to bloody up your linoleum
But that's what happens when niggas neglect to watch their sodium
I'm an animal sitting amongst it's prey
Praying to keep it peaceful but egos get in the way…
Thinking they all can test you, but I've been prolonging fate
Push me again and I guarantee I'm feasting today!
I say
Trying not to lose my humanity
This society stealing all of my sanity
I'm a statement away from breaking the amity;
And making an example of idiots for the vanity
Can't express opinions now without responses lately
Call me crazy but I'm just from a place where people listen mainly;
Man these niggas must be trippin or sippin if they think they could face me
But if I deface them then I'm the monster?!

Somebody save me!
I once heard the quote ""If you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.""
I also overheard ""A spoon cannot taste of the food it carries. Likewise, a foolish man cannot understand the wise man´s wisdom even if he associates with a sage.""

My modus operandi now is just to break the standard;
Gods had their elbows on tables, I told them watch their manners
I'm on the ends of good and evil like I'm Mr. Cicero
Greco-Roman principles, feeling less than invincible
Ab Incunabulis; I was staring at Anubis
Taking hold of my dreams, weighing my heart for it's trueness
Scholar turned student, pupil turned preacher
For the teachers, no room for leachers go to the bleachers, nigga

~~~

An awakening of a new beast
I stopped searching for a lane and broke ground on a new street
True heat, getting these beats then I'm giving them loose teeth
Punches in bunches, the crowd melts when my crew speaks
Chillin on Duncan Hills, man I'm so fuckin ill
Check my XP I'm matchmaking bars with trueskill…
This is a new sensation, I think I'm Gary Payton
This shit is cray you can't find me though cause I'm hibernatin'
Just really contemplating, about this new creation
Rolling an entourage in the backwoods with tracks banging
Keep it a stack, vapors bringing me back
To a place where I feel feral my past life's come to attack
And now I'm just baring my fangs:
Look a track and I'm going insane
Step in my brain
Adrenaline pumping through all of my veins
+ the
Fight or flight system is making a change
I'm tripping and stay
Calm though the storm I create for the lames
Killing the game it just isn't enough so I turn to a god and destroy all you trust from these words made of flames",Dom McLennon,1995,[46],1

Nobody knows what I go through

It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
They don’t understand what I’ve been through
They don’t understand what I go through
You think everything’s all good but you only see what I show you
They don’t understand that boss life, gotta take care of my whole crew
(My whole crew, my whole crew) they depend on me my fuckin niggas
They know the love is real and I’m a fuckin winner
We all gon' eat, Sunday dinner
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up, they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around, look around
If I gotta be the one to lift us up, I won’t let em down
So at the top it’s just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us, but we gon' get this paper
Had a couple issues, I dealt with them, now it’s payback

Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They don’t understand this life that I chose

And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
It’s like everybody got they hand out
Actin' like they you owe 'em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show 'em something
One month, you're broke again
Actin' like you ain’t throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas, they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you ain’t got it, they forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was losin', so forget me when I’m winnin'
Where the dark day was frenzing me 'til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It’s hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions, I can’t waste my energy
For them I got that remedy, kill 'em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I’m blessed
My comeback’s they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn’t really with me all the way - I’ll be okay

[Chorus: Future]
Nobody knows what I go through
If you can put yourself inside my shoes
You got friends is not friends no more
They don’t understand this life that I chose
And when the money and fame
It can hurt everything you love
I got some people that depend on me
And I can’t give up; don’t know what I’m going through",Juelz Santana,1995,"[49, 57, 79]",3
49,Get Together,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

[Chorus]
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

[Verse 2]
Some may come and some may go
We will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass

[Chorus]
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

[Chorus]
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

[Verse 3]
If you hear the song I sing
You will understand (listen!)
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

[Chorus]
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

50,Cell Therapy,"[Verse 1: Khujo]
When the scene unfolds, young girls 13 years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin' they got rank
See SEGA ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas, trained assassins
Do search and seize, ain't knocking or asking
They're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipelines
Infernos outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future look it up, where they say it in the Constitution?
That in the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Got to deal with W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

[Chorus]
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with a serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me, 'cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin to do?
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the new world order, time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or keep our ass in

[Chorus]
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

[Verse 3: T-Mo]
Listen up, lil nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew every day
On the average 'bout four or five, I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
Now I realize the cost after I lost my best friend Bean
I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin?
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't 16 years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox, I want outta this hole
I'm in a cell under attack, loc up folks
They in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reach the planet without the black man

[Verse 4: Big Gipp]
So what's your aim? Try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home
And not wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking, no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask on the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow

[Chorus]
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich

Hey! Well, that's exactly what a nigga came for
Huh, you doin' shots from afar

Don't I make it look good?

[Chorus]
Hey, now you, drank up all my liquor, come on
What I'm supposed to do now?

You know I might never come down
Let me get down
You might not never come down
Now let me come down
You might not never come down
Let me get down!

C'mon, uh
Can't beat it, can't beat it, can't beat it
Can't beat it with a big bat though
Can't see her with this pitch black Gucci frames on
Let me take these bitches off
Let me get the full scope, hold up
Huh, full screen, HD, let me take another picture
Let me pull it to the pre-show
Whoa, cool beans, cool beans
That's a whole lot of reefer
Let me help you with the pre-roll

Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah

[Verse 1: Amy]
This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn’t wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You’re replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow
Uh-oh, yup

[Pre-Chorus: Amy]
Now I’m here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I’m pacin'

I don’t wanna think too hard, but I’m sour
Uh-oh, I can’t seem to let you go

[Chorus: Amy]
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio!

[Verse 2: Amy]
What’s the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin’ bottles by the phone, oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turned me inside out
That’s enough, call me up, baby, I’m in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don’t even think you know
No, no, no

See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby

Anything you wanna do, I’ll be on it too
Everything you said, is like gold with a view

I’m on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio

How do I live after losing you I can't do that

Sentimental things, they bring
They make me think of all you said
Never lettin' go, you're always on my mine

As you watch from heaven up above I know you're shining down I wish you werearound but you've gone away to a place where someday you and I will meet eachother, and forever
I pray that we'll always be together
You couldn't even sleep alone because you said that it was scary without me
Your tender heart will probably be hurt
Can I not go with you
Watching you, who can not fall asleep from the pain
I pray so that you can open your eyes tomorrow morning for just one more day

Well, I guess that's what them likes get you
You know this battle is kinda like the building
The heat is on and you 'bout to have some serious Mike (mic) issues!
What, y'all think I can't freestyle for nothin'?
Boy, I'm wild seasoned
Geechi battled just now, I start a TEC (Tech), half the crowd leavin'
No time wastin'
Though this a waste of time, I figured I'd shake up with the best
This is ""disrespected"" versus ""can't seem to get respected""
And well, that's a problem I need to take up with the rest
Until then, I'm in Cali, shiieeet, I took a- pay cut just to flex
Parallel universe, you believe in it?
You here to try to Trump a white man and I'm here to Wake Up Mr. West
It all starts, with a Glock spittin'
Iron, Mike versus the Vegas, the kid like 'Pac did it
Born Legacy Supreme, R Streetz
'Cause by the third went Top missin'
We two different elements, separated
And Kemetics, is where the plot thickens
So excuse my punctuation, mark
You half-assed; semi colon
Pause, that's for people thinkin' Dot different
Nah, are you progressin' or talkin', you either build or boast
Aye, I (AI) flew to West World, Bernard told me to kill the host
With steel lines, to heat up a square, he a radiator
Fuck a knife fight, we ain't joustin'
What I blew (blue) knock red off his pedestal: American Gladiators
I've seen people tougher than you, and you ain't built like ours
You lack Courage, dawg (dog), and I use this (Eustace) bag just to kill a coward
Your queen? As beautiful as a rose, and I love pickin' flowers
That box, the most exciting place to bust (bus) and drop in: Tilted Towers!
Fortnite bars!

I'm meal toting, max shield potions, holdin' two 50's
BAOW, that's what he get for bringin' me the drama
Cheapskate, shitty teammate, he ain't see the Llama
Bro you too paranoid so I doubt your performance
All you gon' do is cry, nothin' but a clown we recordin'
Whatchu gon' talk about? My suicide?
Bro, that sound get aborted like, ""What you knew Blood?""
I drew Blood without the extortion
Fuck a B. Dot, I'll murder the whole Left Side Connection
Buck-50, he gon' need his whole left side connected
I booked your funeral soon as I booked my Airbnb
The knife I got, IHOP, it go from P to B!
Or the Desert E, fire into this queer chin
He took every single round, y'all know I can't get a clear win
Fear him? Boy, I played Suge since I had a shot drawn
Now it's a shot drawn, I'm in front of your house, now it's your door gettin' knocked on
Versus EK, it looked like Smack you was about to pop on
But we copped the pay-per-view
Just watch the battle live...Dot calm (.com)!
Get tossed, somethin' without the pen
But fuck a credit scheme, let it scream
Back of the whip, you playin' Kennedy
I clown on you, aim down on you, I'm in a mezzanine
Gat named ""The Saurus"", deuce deuce, Two Time Everything
I let it ring
Boy The Beatles can't even Let It Be
Your girl wanted Nuttin' But Love, I gave her Heavy D
I crack a bottle on Blood head, I'm spillin' Grenadine
I'm just comparin' Kemetic Science to kinetic energy
I'll weave, put Dot to sleep, he'll need pajama pants
The only dude annoying to Mike would be Banana Man
If it's work involved, I'll search for Charles, that's an anagram
I'll stomp your Cali ass the fuck out, you'll get the Hammer Dance
I didn't have much room to do the Hammer Dance but, keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
You here to act like you still a boss and battle me
I'm here to put some life into your false reality
Time

[Round 1: B. Dot]
Check this, you'll remember this
Who wanna scrap wit' me? Mikey P
Tell your boss to show me the money get your Jerry Maguire on
I'm known for being fire on cam', you known for being on cam' gettin' fired on
L.A. let's turn this riot on
New York, we done studied the game tapes and we see why y'all bang late
See a nigga like me wouldn't let you slide, and why (NY)?
Because initially, mentally we not in the same state
See out east, you told Suge he was the biggest known slob since Biz and Owens
Blood is you dumb?
Do you know where you at?
Do you know where I'm from?
Didn't you say ""Fuck the West""?
Then called a triple OG that started Westside Ps a ""slob"", wow the disrespect
The irony, I wanna Just Do It but then I know I won't get the check
Respect the west
What the fuck you know about gangbangin'?
White boy from New York, middle class maintainin'
My niggas really in the field, the only shit you kill is Call Of Duty game playin'
Callin' out Brizz and Roc, like you top tier main stagin'
This neanderthal only want to battle y'all to show who's really Cave Gangin'
I came sprayin'
Haters gon' say it's Photoshop when I come through with more machinery than Robocop
They'll take your bitch for ransom, you gon' have to put money on your heart like them weak ass clothes you rock
The flow don't stop
Think Pacquiao when I pack him out, givin' him the same treatment Cotto got
Or flash with the cannon (Canon), you here standin' next to me brings a whole new meanin' to photo op'
The fo' fo' cocked, and I'm shootin' big bullets, it'll feel like a boulder block
And some guys only about that thing, and when it sing, you better duck like you know the wop
You know this Dot, I'm only here to address you Mike
""You had a lot to say about a league you said yes to twice.""
That's that slave mentality
Thinkin' I say ""yes"" to a league ain't gon' sway or rattle me
Nigga I say ""yes"" for the west, show some respect, if I ain't accept this there ain't no way we battling
Thanks for travelling
We heard the hype just figured you for the nervous type
Thought I had a different opponent til I noticed they subbed you in the game and had you throw on a jersey, Mike
Well this gon' be American History, X-cept we gon' change the script and word it tight
Give you the curb to bite
Rest in peace Emmett Till
We'll tie this white bitch to the front of the whip, I'm reversin' life
You gon' reimburse them, right?
I mean they paid for the flight I'm sure the purse was nice
You was racin', they told you ""be patient"" but they didn't explain you was goin' under the surgeon's knife
You suburban white, and write like you live some sort of urban life
From New York, all the way to L.A., do it BIG, well that's just gon' get your Suburban striked
I'm in an urge to fight, they done put a real life in front of the poltergeist
So I'm checkin' you with the one, two like I think it's a broken mic
I get up close to strike, poke him twice, razor sharp Logan knife
With that over right then it's, ""Oh goodnight.""
White boys always wanna wrestle, til somethin' open they chest like Hogan hype
You better hold on Mike, you the mom that's driftin' here with the paradigm shiftin'
On URL, where all the stars are at the top of the mountain, actin'
Paramount Pictures, KG, where is my digits?
After this we gon' talk bro'
This will be the last time you get me for the cost low
I figured they'd put me in front of the wigger cause they gettin' somethin' big for the cheap price and he used to workin' at Costco
My fault though, for tryin' to help you Mike
You said I wanted more money for this battle, well you right
Was tryin' to get you more money too, but that's what they not gon' tell you Mike
You're so connected to URL
You think you're free but can't see how they handheld you Mike
No Henny bottle but they treat you like canned goods the way they shelf you Mike
I see you're not gelled too tight
All kind of cracks in the guy cranium
I mean, what kind of (Wakanda) shit is this?
Smack is T'challa sendin' a white agent to the sky to stop Killmonger from passin' the Vibranium
Ain't no savin' him, Smack I'll drop another third round, don't make me go there
I find it Strange, you can't create fire rounds but get to jumpin' in my world outta nowhere
This is no fair, y'all done stuffed dynamite inside of the wheel barrel
And rode in front of battle raps Will Farrell
All this jokin' and fuckin' around, and still can't make it baby, you should feel sterile
Why air you? I'm not here to let a gun go blam
I'd rather pull out, pistol whip him in the mouth
You know, smack his lips like Twork when his punch don't land
I got a hunch though fam', you gon' be like my last competition
I'm used to the opposition and hit the fans with the proposition
Like, ""B. Dot is street and he conscious. And that's conflictin'"", a sick disposition
Now I just fuse my future with my past
He once tried to decide on a half, that ain't gon' help you get no split decision
This for my Crips in prison and all my Bloods behind the walls in the wicked system that don't fit this description
Yeah you know this Matrix hates us
All these codes I'm tryin' to Control/Alt/Delete and shift encryptions
Even your team's indifferent
I talked to Mickey on the phone he was like, ""Dot I don't know. You got superlative raps
But Mike's pen's gettin' better. He could Trump you.""
I say, ""Well that's fake news. The wrong alternative facts.""
And besides, Mickey gon' be turnin' his back the same way he did with Joe Budden
Watchin' his homie gettin' punched on and looked away like he don't know nothin'
Y'all hoes frontin'
Yellow Tape Gang, which one of y'all gon' throw fists and clap?
Nigga, Bonnie Godiva's the only G from your Unit we've ever seen go get the strap
You better roll a clip back
This that black African power
And if these was your last days Mikey, this is your last hour

[Round 2: Mike P]
I thought to touch on your Kemetic Science but my mind was stressed so I diverted
More to pure shit, and tell that every line complex, a wordsmith
To this herb shit, there is nothin' that this guy can test
And if his people wanna jump in, I'm splittin' Dot Mobb in half; Shine vs Rex
Let's turn up
Flame life, I'll put the heat on ops
Use your pussy white angles, Mike P no cop
Get K.O.'d you wouldn't see those shots
A fist to lame, it's Twister game, so when son hit the floor, hands and feet on Dot
I've been the nicest
Long before Thanos I've been a Titan
Spine shot, he start convulsin', that's meningitis
Brush me wrong, it's a Scope in your mouth, that's gingivitis
Shoulder shot, he can't lift an arm up, that's tendinitis
I said I ride with a pocket pistol, miniature, but I like the hammer
It's small, but does the job cause it's the little things in life that matters
I snuck it in the venue, they ask how the GP did it
It's easy to sneak a pistol in if it's 3D printed
I flew here, for a tag, puttin' you up in a grave
DNA, with the piece, I can maneuver with a K
Home court what?
Bitch you ain't know what I would do up in this place
Corky Romano, you here for a white bag but it blew up in your face
Oh you fire in L.A., but let's be honest, you don't stack bars
Canada vs Verb, boy you barley even scratched god
You terrible at road trips, wack god
You hate to camp so when you cook you only comfortable makin' fires in your backyard
How dare you test the pen, like you do it better
The white skin peel in L.A. I ain't used to the weather
For a band, I'll pop punks in Cali without Rufio
You shit on the tree and URL, but never gave yourself room to grow
You diva, vs Mike I'm Tyson, with what I do to hoes
Bullets Caillou, bald heads goin' through your clothes
I'm evil Ryu, no remorse for what I do to souls
And if I try you, I'm puttin' ten on your back like a [?]
Silly wit' that
If I Reed Dollaz I get silly wit' cats
Two rounds is all I need, I Surf verse Nitty a cat
The bulldog bitin' and I don't give a shit if he strapped
Soon as he feels the nips he (Nipsey) Hustle
But I turn back around for a victory lap
You wanna argue URL? Fine, let's talk holmes
Issues I had, I hashed out wit' 'em, not cried and throwed stones
And any argument, can end wit' a knife
So point chrome, cause even if I lose this debate, I still drive the point home
Be honest, thank me for doin' this in the west for you
I could've extra killed you in New York, but I want the best of you
I took the disadvantage, cause I ain't scared like the rest of you
Nobody said ""yes"" to you, pussy I requested you!
And the fact that you here right now, I've lost respect for you
But I guess it's ""Fuck URL"" til URL throws some checks to you
Time

[Round 2: B. Dot]
They say Mike P punch crazy, CRAZY, Mike
The dopest white battle rapper on Smack
How is that?
You not even the dopest white battle rapper in your camp
I mean it's quite apparent that you ain't fuckin' with Aaron
And white battle rap that's such a small space to be sharin'
It's gettin' over crowded but you allowed it
Can't put your trust in connivers
Jealous Ones Envy, especially when you see them on the road to success
And that's a car you was just in (Justin), Driver
Now you the hitchhiker searchin' for the newest road
You blew it bro
White Battle Rapper On Smack was your own little world
And we stopped watchin' your Truman Show to view Glue' and Joe
But I brought the coolest scope
These fans deserve a brand new optic
I'm here to widen the lens and zoom in on the microscopic to show y'all how Mike views profit (Prophet)
We all watched it, as you came in this game and changed lanes cause you had a few options
It was either Smack/URL or you could've been King Of The Dot'in'
Which one will get the views poppin'?
You first made the news when dude socked him, dropped him
Boo bopped, clocked him
And that was the first time you had a few dudes watchin'
That's when that short fuse popped in
Your Ascension in the game when dude took flight
I mean you took takin' punchin', in a battle, to whole new heights
But I can't understand you Mike
Cause fuck a contractual obligation
Let somebody snuff me, I'ma pop you, that's an actual confirmation
And I ain't makin' up with nobody in these battle situations
I mean you, plus a body bag will be the only thing y'all add in my Math-ematical equation
But I get the evaluation
You vs Tink The Demon was hot, but see I dug a lil' deeper
Looked down in the grave and I seen through the plot
This wigger write like he fight for civil rights, Mike, we all agree that you not
Just cause you Rose a little bit don't mean that you can Park here and not relinquish your spot
I mean, why not fight with ICE?
Try to kill the Wolf in a small corridor like Leonidas when he was [?]
Maybe it's cause you know if you went up north to the cold you'd get exposed
As just another flake that blends in with the snow over at King Of The Dot
And we see this a lot
White boys wanna ball with the blacks
We go hard in the paint, they never seen on the block
This is our lane
We draw the attention and only dish it to wiggers when we needin' a shot
But believe it or not
If you go over there with 'Ganik you'd do damage
And you know this, right?
But see it's all part of his gang, he claim he wanna stick to his Genesis
Play Station'ed in his slot where he can be this token white
Keep focus sight
You gotta see through the bloggin', Facebook lies and how he markets it
I got foresight to see through Fort Nite and now you put up a shield and build
Fortifications to hide behind and not get your target hit
It's obvious, your demo is in the graphics
That's how you grow audience?
Well where we from this system don't work for us
That's why we blow cartridges
The awkwardness, all fusin' to a dude that use video game schemes and make y'all applaud the shit?
But y'all wouldn't accept that from a nigga like Dre Vishiss or Geechi Gotti, some of the hardest Crips
But you was able to hit Tink wit', everything on the move list
That Hadouken!
That you did!
Only got approved when
We gave you a pass and didn't laugh at the bullshit
'Cause of your skin
And you knew this
And I'm just gettin' it all of my chest like a nudist
I thought I figured out these squares
It appears I'm still havin' trouble with the Rubix
So the tool is
Makin' arrangements to blossom his top like a tulip
Pussy nigga, two lips
The heat will make him cool it
You can catch a blue flame, that's that Crip and that Piru shit!
You're foolish, thinkin' I'ma just let you walk into hip hop
See the goal he has is to stand in front of the net, upload a clip
If it's funny or controversial his shit pop
And what we do? Give him a Lil' Pump, some aahs, a Lil' Uzi Vert to the tip top
Got these pussies suckin' they own dick in the race to get to 69 position
Well, this is that pit stop
Get your shit clocked
More niggas flamed up than what the Dips got
Big Dot, soon as I went viral, there was a two year big stop
URL contract, sign that, shit nah
New slaves, but I know how to evade the slipknot
Hitchcock, put him in the Twilight, fif' cocked
Silencer on it, the shit'll sound like a rim shot
Who hot? Him not
Grown man? Kid not
Barrel pointed at an undercover cop like, ""You killed Big Pop""
Gridlocked, what make you think you can beat me?
My nigga, I studied etymology, and honestly
I know your last name is pronounced ""Poo-lee-see"" and I digged deeply
Do the research like I'm supposed to
In Italian, ""Pulice"" means ""something small and annoying""
Well, what a fitting name for what he means to this culture
And y'all chose to, put the updated PCs in front of the archive
Not smart, guys
So when I separate 'em, think segregation, ropes around each wrist, we pull 'em apart tied (apartheid)
This the dark side
Nah, I ain't Brizz but it's gon' be a Raw deal when the fif' flyin'
Send half the clip at your clique, have your men dyin'
And send you eight (insinuate) for anything you was implyin'
You gon' die tryin'
This that Black African Power
And if these was your last days, Mikey, this is yo' last hour

[Round 3: Mike P]
I said, you know what? L.A., this ain't even about competition
Look, y'all, he's charged with fallin' in love with the URL system
Think of this as a filmed inquisition
I'm 'bout to give y'all a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics your deposition
True or false: LA been runnin' battle rap?
True or false? Y'all been lined with some killers
And every year, URL throws an event around this time for the realest
Danny, Diz, Nitty, Geechi, EK: these fuckin' guys are gorillas
Puts in all the damn work without cryin' a river
Now, hear me out, cause he got the feelin' he a side piece, he insecure
Convinced that he's missin' out on a ride, sweet
He Drake new album, and this goes way beyond rhymes deep
Cause A: he raps great, but you turn a little soft when you start to side B
Dot! Find peace
Cause a lot of great writers like you done came and went
The more you show your cards, the more give them different ways to vent
Like your contradictions
And we gon' touch on all those mind games you pitch
Like how you don't care about battle rap, but you cared that you weren't the main event
Main event?
Bro, co-main event, I wouldn't hand you that
You said you cared about music more but you couldn't even handle that
My first song in five years, SMOKED YOU, you couldn't even handle tracks
Dawg, how you from LA (*chk-chk*) and you couldn't even handle Wax
Don't even answer that
Address the switch in your steez in that third round vs EK when you shit on the league
I do not get what it means
How you were shittin' on Beas' for puttin' Diz on the stage but you got Diz on your team
But ooooh
FACTS
Let's just ignore that from the pseudo-righteous race-baiter
Besides, it was a haymaker
We felt that shit a day later
Even though it was bullshit lies while he was starin' y'all down
Cause he a jealous ass rapper that likes to pander to crowds
Let's get to panderin' now
Grippin', I'm eyein' somethin' crazy
He froze up, I rose up, you'll be lyin' in the daisies
The tiny little snub nose, got him flyin' to the gate
He, thought he was incredible, too (Incredible 2), 'til he saw the kid firin' (fire in) the baby
I see right through all the bullshit that this cat scan
Colt .45 and I use it, as a back hand
There's levels to this maze of a game, so let the gat blam
I'll ghost 'em, 'til he blue
'Cause what's a Dot compared to what I pack? Man! (Pac-Man)
I heard of his troops, there's birds to recoup
Got in the Benz, drive it and park
I peeked in his house, then seen him get out
Dot on the ledge, got out the car
I'm turnin' to Mook if I'm yearnin' to shoot
Plot on his death, shot on this mark
Gun to his head, then one in his chest
Dot on his head, dot on his heart!
What UP!? What up!?
I said, I'm gettin' at him
For your rhymes, I'm airin' at a mark
Donald Trump: the .45 splittin' families apart
Fuck this guy dumpin', if Dot want it, the blade Tony Hawk
Six buck fifties, cause I'll spin 'em into a 900
So keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
YOU here to act like a boss and battle me
I'M here to put some life into your false reality

[Round 3: B. Dot]
I wanna share somethin' wit' you Mikey, I'm not sure if you remember this
It was back in the day when we would exchange, you know, have our little differences
You DM'd me an apology, that was man of you, but it was interestin' how you ended it
""Oh you fake Lux you wrong for bringin' the DM up.""
Nah nigga he was wrong for sendin' it
But let's get into it
We gon' skip right to the end
Where you say, ""As one of the good Europeans, it's hard to not to instinctively defend.""
Now, European instinct, that's what I wanna talk about
The first two rounds was the head shot, this the autopsy after we chalk him out
Let me walk you out
So there's no confusion about evolution
We migrated out of Africa up into Europe, I'm talkin' archaic humans
Used to the humid, 'til we get caught in the cold,  grey skies
UV rays couldn't get through them
In order to receive vitamin D that was heaven sent we lost melanin and turned into mutants
And that biology, fucks wit' your psychology
Appearance started to change and the mind gets caught up in rage
Dirty Europeans, until my ancestors the Moors went up into Spain and Italy and taught 'em to bath
Just flip through the page, this is history
This ain't facts I gotta spit, now look at you
Another dirty European gettin' washed up by an African again
I don't battle rap to win, I'm here to contend with the ancestry from which you descend
Them Greeks that came over to speak on my people
Called us ""Ethiots"" which meant ""burnt skin""
And y'all want some type of utopia
Well, I want revenge for Ethiopia
The only un-colonized country on the continent, that's why your Italian ancestors bombed the shit
And I'm astonished wit', the fact that blacks don't see we been beefin' with Italians since that Hannibal/Carthage shit
So it's that mobster hit
Dome shot to the back of the head, face first in a pasta dish
You make me sick
The fuck did you do to beat me when you a descendant of Mussolini?
Drugs? You use 'em freely
I highly doubt we can go that route
Every cell I see got brothers doin' years for grams of kiwi
Y'all peep me?
Haile Selassie, I know you prolly ain't catch it
But I practice ancestor worship, I'm just invokin' the spirit
I'm 'bout to hold up this mirror
I want to see yourself through a scientific perspective
Your genetics? Recessive
And that's what lead to the depression durin' your early adolescence
You're tellin' Suge, ""My depression had to do with my pops.""
You slit your wrists and got me up here killin' time, I guess we both on suicide watch
What should I do to my op'?
Let the heater fly? Nah, I'd rather slit your wrist
Put another white bitch in the tub, let him bleed and die
Me and 12 other niggas you battled can be the 13 Reasons Why
Aye, my nigga, we can't slice no even pie
You make a hit, run base get home safe, don't even slide
We hit and miss, that's three strikes, get life without even cryin'
You don't see this crime?
All these obstacles, you never got accustomed to the cops accosting you
Constantly, to the point you wanna take off the black skin like it's a costumed suit
What was so hard for you?
Couldn't meet daddy's expectations of graduation from them Harvard schools?
Pops was hard on you
So you went psychotic, turn to narcotics, sniffin' lines, pill pop and shoot just to get him off of you
You lost your screws
Thoughts confused
Ever since daddy left you've been alone and suicide been in the dome
You do all this bloggin', then wanna hide behind madness and use drugs, but when in Rome
We can't skip the tone
Yeah you rap black but still act Vic Damone
Mike my words can never hurt you
But you an addict and you know what they say about sticks and stones
Let's switch the mold
I'm not even from New York, but I know the history of the mafia that put
Drugs in the black communities that fuck nigga's mamas up and put nigga's pops in cuffs
Didn't want to sell to your own communities so y'all cut deals with black drug dealers to get the profits up
I can take you on a crash course on how they dump drugs in LA and came back around with the armor trucks
Put us on smack to kill us, now you on Smack gettin' killed
Nigga, karma sucks
But, be honest brah, would you swap wit' us?
Would you trade your life Mike and give up your white rights?
To be reincarnated as a young black durin' the crack era of the '80s when the crime spiked
It was beyond trife
They gave us guns and drugs in the dark, but in hindsight
What an evil genius, to make us move weight like limestone and put us all under that limelight
Now, would you trade your life Mike, to be a young black always under suspiscion
Get arrest cause you fit the description
Three years in prison never given a sentence
Solitary confinement, gettin' beat by the C.O.'s and the inmates, and all you do is defend it?
Til you finally release cause they couldn't provide evidence or give' em a witness
Are y'all seein' the difference?
Between your suicidal admittance you spit in your writtens
And a brother like Kalief Browder who needed relief, but couldn't get it 'cause the tone of his pigment
So suicide was committed
I don't condone it, but I get it
Here's a way for you to relate:
Think of a game where the whole system is against you, but you can't remotely control it
You've been chosen for moments
Your childhood trauma you went through you want this culture to notice is bogus
You sold weight on the corners, copped some piff, wasn't ""stop and frisk"" 'cause a white boy like you would never be noticed
You from Long Island, complainin' cause your pops was controllin'
He was on Riker's Island, detained him cause a backpack was stolen
I'm just exposin' the motives
White men lack resources so they go around stealin' wealth
Genocide, then when all men have died, he turn the gun around and kill himself
How destructive of you
And you wanna bring all of that into battle rap, how fucked up is you?
Man this culture needs substance from a brother, like me not substance abuse
I don't fuck wit' you dudes
I got no empathy for white male misery, somethin' gotta give
Rich whites wanna kill they selves, poor black just wanna live
This shit is sick
If you ask me, battle rap deserves a better switch
Like you should've died when you slit your wrists, Young B should've been never hit
You are evidence that white rappers are guests in hip-hop, never residents
Don't insult my intelligence
Claimin' you culturally relevant cause your suicidal embellishment
I've been negligent, but now I'm back to cast out demons like the Exorcist
The black man is god Mikey, and as always, the white man remains devilish
This western shit
And this that black African power
And if these was yo' last days Mikey, this was your last hour",URLtv,1995,"[69, 75, 70, 71, 66, 77, 82, 74, 74, 85]",10
68,Sexual Healing,"[Intro]
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight

[Verse 1]
Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

[Verse 2]
Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to heal me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing

(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

[Bridge]
Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

[Chorus]
And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual Healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby ohhh

[Verse 3]
Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in
Darling, you're so great
I can't wait for you to operate

(Heal me my darling)
I can't wait for you to operate

[Chorus]
When I get this feeling
I need Sexual Healing
Oh when I get this feeling
I need Sexual Healing
I gotta have Sexual Healing, darling
'Cause I'm all alone
Sexual Healing, darling
'Till you come back home

Please don't procrastinate

69,Throw Your Hands Up,"[Verse 1: Eightball]
Bitch, I ain't got nothing but time
So I'mma get out on these cuts and grind
Keep my mind on cloud twenty-nine
My player ways keep me with plenty dimes
See I'mma shine like all six of my gold teeth
When a nigga get through cooking up this O-Z
All night on the block 'til the sun rise
My only friend is a Glock with the 4-5
Four, five in the mornin', it don't stop
Daydreamin' 'bout flossin' a drop top (woop)
Blue lights snap me back to reality
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks ain't got shit to do but harass
Searched a nigga and took about a three in cash
I guess that's better than gettin locked up
Or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up, huh!

[Chorus: MJG + Eightball]
Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up

[Verse 2: MJG]
I got a maid cooking grits with a, outfit
So tight my niggas wanna stay the whole nite
Dice game in the kitchen, nigga, T. Lee
Nigga drunk singin' sounding like the Bee Gees
Ham sam'ich in the driveway, drop top
Naked women in the den playing, hop scotch
Thirty bustas in my yard, they be, long gone
So hit me and I'mma keep my, phone on
I be out turning corners, dranking, one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims, 'cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday, she hit me, ten times
If I diss her it'll take a nigga, ten lines
MJG standing tall and I, won't fold
You can have all the bitches, 'cause I, don't hold
On to any woman like a human handcuff
You got ya hair down, baby, fuck it, stand up!

[Chorus: MJG + Eightball]
Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
How many flows can I compose? I drop this slang like lyrical 'bows
Stickin' out just like an OUTKAST or a thorn from stem of rose
Like nachos, the lyrics are crispy, crackin' when y'all bite
Been had a Coke and a smile, now I'm trippin off Yak & Sprite
Y'all just might see the skunk guy, with a girl who chunked thighed
Below the Mason-Dixon line, real niggas know what I'm talkin' about
From Texas, Atlanta, oh man, Alabama, Savannah
The deeper, the darker, the Dirty South is what I'm after
No laughter, the content of the rhyme may be contagious
The Space Age is pimpin this, players comin' major
They shot the sucka, sprayed ya, cut ya wife and played her
The player the B-I-G B-O-I, dope boy rhyme maker
Beats, rhymes, and layers of music right here to please you
And if you hate the Dirty, then patna, see we don't need you
You know I'm talkin 'bout?
OutKast, Eightball, MJG on y'all punk motherfuckers!

[Chorus: MJG + Eightball]
Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
You wouldn't understand, if you stood under it (ooh)
It's like the more that I talk to you, the dumber that I get
The closer that I walk to you, the further that we stand
Apart, distant
Nobody has the upper hand but my body's resistant
So now, throw your phalanges in the ground
I'm still abound, un-believers stay from hell around
I found negative niggas they only keep ya down
Transmitting from Native American burial ground
I carry around, the weight of all worlds on my shoulder pads
I'm post to blast, space invaders up somebody's dad
Serious as Aa-Bb-Cc
If knowledge be the key then buddy roasted on the porch
And wait for ya momma to get off work so she can roast yo' ass
They need to find an open window fast
Word to the motherfucker; word to the motherfucker
Word to the motherfucker!

[Chorus: MJG + Eightball]
Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up",8Ball & MJG,1995,"[71, 65, 88, 87, 76, 84, 89]",7

71,Magic Carpet Ride,"{Instrumental}

I like to dream, yes, yes
Right between the sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near
To the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

[Chorus]
Close your eyes girl
Look inside girl
Let the sound
Take you away

{Instrumental}

Last night I hold Aladdin's lamp
So I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Well, someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around a lousy candle's all I found

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride

Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free

[Chorus]
Close your eyes girl
Look inside girl

Take you away

Well, you don't know what we can find

When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
View from a balcony, pool lit up blue
Lawn chairs next to the ice chest
Stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
Now I'm getting blown by a bitch
Who? I don't know her name
Gold chain hanging, got a few in the room
But I don't wear them out, only wear them in the house
'Cause I shine so bright, I don't wanna blind you
Who knew Yung $now wouldn't melt in the summer? It's true
Cold as a polar bear
Chilling with Stunna and $lick, I'm surrounded by tulips
Got me 'bout two clips
Got me 'bout two scripts filled up with Oxy
Smoke hovers all around my fucking body
I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah, I shot him
$lick got the shovels, and we digging all night
Pouya in the Caddy
Told him, ""shine the light bright"" 'cause I'm digging in darkness
What was a good day has turned into the usual
Back in all black like a funeral

[Bridge: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
Runnin' from the cops through the motherfucking 7th
Six bodies dropped, and nobody went to heaven
Block stay hot when I'm creeping with the weapon
Gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
City of the crescent, riding with a Smith and Wesson
Got a motherfucker guessing when I hit 'em with the blessing
Two shots to the dome, six shots in the chrome
All shot through your home, now that’s a crime zone
$-U-I-C-I-D-E, $carecrow creepin' with Uzi
Lucifer, please come save me, throw crucifixes at my feet
Walking through the depths of hell, watchin' as the oceans swell
Grey*59, that's Los Cartel
Nothing but death in every cell

[Bridge: Marie Therese]
When you come home, I'll stop this
When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 3: Pouya]
Yuh, she too deep in the flask
Drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
Déjà vu, I've been through it with you
Multiple times on many occasions
Contemplating vacating without you, I doubt you the one
I could be wrong; I could be sprung; I could be dumb
I could be dumbfounded, well-rounded
Plus the head game therapeutic
She knew that she blew it like Nintendo, you heard me
Some of y'all better curve me, my dick game army strong
My only hope is my song go on for long
This life ain't promised whether you accomplished
What you think about inside of yo apartment
You working for nothing you worthless, bitch

Thinkin' 'bout back in the days when the year was '89
Little nigga on the grind, gotta get mine doing my crime
With Toot and Hen, steady stacking my ends
Putting my serve down on the Clair 9-9
Hitting up the Graveyard Shift with Ren
Little Will, Big Wally and Wish Bone
Little Wally High Rollerz and he wonder why niggas so strong
Krayzie Bone, stack, Rod Jay, much love
Kept a nigga on his toes in the game
It's an everyday thang when you let ya nuts hang
Gotta make a grand at least daily, man
Them Cleveland hustlers never no busters, thug to the heart
We niggas from the land fool, and the old school
Just serve out ya sentence and be cool
Fucking with Trues, rest in peace
Little nigga RIPsta stress that Bone love
Smoking on bud, 'cause a nigga Mo Thug
Calling up my niggas when it's time to nut up
In the 9-9, niggas gonna drop to the number one
With your gun so run, run
Cleveland is the city where a nigga come from
Slanging them dum dum dum dums

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Niggas it's going down up in the C-Town
Get 'em up with a thug and the nigga with the bud
Got the fifth of Rose
'Fore the liquor store close, hit 'em up with the forty reasons
Nigga roll up the Buddha
Smoke it all up nigga, don't stiff on the reefer
Mo running up outta the club with this
Plus I got hydro and this shit is creeper, peep the
Strip as you hear the double Glock-Glock
Widda me rocks cocked, sweating me bad
Coppers betta drop when the gunshots pop
Glock top hit the body and the bullshit stop
Whenever them troubling us
Where the po-po niggas roll solo, split up and swerve
Krayzie take caution, take out my yayo and tossed it
Send 'em in the road to the curb
Running, ducking
Jumping up in the land, my niggas is crazy
We slang and we buck and we bang on the Glock
And my nigga that’s daily
Who the nigga with the 12-gauge, pump
Mr. Sawed-Off Leatherface so you betta pray
Eternally thugsta, East 1999
That 9 we rep to the death, what!

[Verse 3: Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give peace to the SCTs
And the one big thug on the Glock
Pump blast to the cash
Then I mash the gas gotta dash away from the cops
Now Li'l Mo Heart steadily sippin' on Rose
Ripping up flesh with six fours
That's that thugsta, yes I pump slugs
And I be dropping 'em off in dumpsters
Fuck them po-po, all a dem bodies we burn, burn

Gotta dip mo' thin ones in sherm
When I'm on a mission for my city
Pick up my niggas be peeling out with me
Me roll up the window, the wind blow
Fuck up my indo high that’s hitting me
Even if the barrels of me 12 gauge are empty, me scandalous
Niggas up outta the woods bucking, no fucking with the family
Now feel it nigga, understand me

East 1999 is where you'll find me
Slanging me motherfucking drugs

[Verse 4: Flesh-N-Bone]
Dun dun, leaving the niggas to cock it, pop widda me gun
They know that me nodding they head off and I gots to have me fun
Leaving 'em hung, breaking, faking, you studio gangsta bitch, trick
Niggas'll get beat, I'm handling the shit and I split in the midst of the darkness
Consider me heartless, oh yes Flesh be running a ho check
Betta check your Rolex, ya timed now for giving up respect
To them SCTs from C-L-E plus scandalous niggas that dwell
Hell off of the forscythe and bail, leaving a trail of
The bloody victims, the Fifth Dog mauling 'em all
And never them catch me slipping
And sipping the fifth of divine
They may give me time instead a me tripping
We flipping the scripts on over, see the Bone a be never sober
Niggas told you, triggers showed you, East 9-9, five soldiers

[Verse 5: Wish Bone]
Wanna run, red rum, try to run and get away
But it's just too late

Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit

76,Just A Girl,"[Verse 1]
Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here

[Verse 2]
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

[Bridge]
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me

Tut mir leid wenn ich den Untertanenstolz jetzt verletze
Doch was quatscht ihr da, es gibt nicht genug Ausbeutungsplätze
Ihr wollt Kapitalismus mit Herz?
Fick mich, aber nicht im Etap Hotel
Sondern richtig schön mit Essen gehen
Und am nächsten Morgen noch Taxigeld
Vor der Glotze, sauer auf die scheiß Sozialschmarotzer
Anstatt auf den Chef, der mit dem Geld aus eurer Arbeit
Seiner Tochter noch 'nen Lamborghini kauft
Alter, dann verdient ihr's auch
Doch ich versteh, ihr regt euch lieber über Brangelina auf
Für's Gewissen 10 Euro spenden
Dann kommen die hoffentlich nicht über die Grenzen
Und holen sich alles zurück, vielleicht lieber doch die Waffenlieferung canceln, fleißig wie ihr seid
Habt ihr doch die Sterbeurkunde schon vom Amt geholt
Der Knopf leuchtet in ampelrot

Meine Vorfahren haben Wildschweine gejagt
Jetzt leb' ich mit Barbaren, die tun was die Bildzeitung ihn' sagt
Ihr Partypatrioten
Seid nur weniger konsequent als diese Hakenkreuz-Idioten
Die geh'n halt noch selber ein paar Ausländer töten
Anstatt jemand' zu bezahl'n, um sie vom Schlauchboot zu treten
Die Welt zu Gast bei Freunden und so
Du und dein Boss ham nix gemeinsam bis auf das Deutschlandtrikot
Ich hab noch nie so treue Sklaven gesehen
Die bereit sind für mehr Arbeit auf die Straße zu gehen
Und Promis treten für die Truppen in Afghanistan auf
Wo sind bloß die Terroristen, wenn man sie grade mal braucht?

Mind if I sit down?
Can I buy you a round?
Haven't seen your face before
Are you new in town?

Oh every time
Are you here alone?
Can I take you home?
Now every woman sees
With every ""pretty please""

And a set of keys

Never let you forget that you're a man
Cuz I'm a W-O-M-A-N
That's what I am, doin' all I can
The thing that makes me mad and crazy, upset
Got to break my neck just to get my respect
Go to work and get paid less than a man
When I'm doin' the same damn thing that he can
When I'm aggressive then I'm a bitch
When I got attitude you call me a witch
Treat me like a sex-object (That ain't smooth)

Excuse me, hold up...(Pep got the floor!)
I'm givin' props to the strong women layin' down the law
Taking control of the wrongs in their life (hey)
Standing up and turning all the wrongs to the right (ho)
I'd like to give a shout out to the mamas out there (Shout it out)
Bringing up the babies with the tender loving care
You're in charge of the future of the nation
Do the right thing, lay the foundation

Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fishscales from triple beams, I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley, packin' fifty calis
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos, just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's, then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen half a Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin' targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us, try to beat us, we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders, lookin' straight charmin' in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas
You gots to come get through our whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin' mad payola
Slangin' that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing, son

[Chorus x2]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So, we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Mid-state and Green, it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery: shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo, but who's petro?
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect, though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots Holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness, shootin, catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

Brother, you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh

When you're livin' in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah

That's how the game goes

Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer
Supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P, my cliquo
Dimes look magnifico, puttin' a cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin' beats with flows
[G Rap] Aiyo, we went from standin' on blocks without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stocks and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel, we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah, so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

I wish I could change it all tonight

The weakest design will fall;
The strong winds will carry on

All alone I waited for the sunlight to clear the storm
For a moment, the light was breaking
And like clockwork, it was gone
All along it was tainted; I wish this was never so
I'm chasing a dream

I wish I could take you home tonight

The weakest design will fall;
The strong winds will carry on

His creaking couplets in a tavern hall,
And I not sing, lest, haply, Scotch Reviews
Should dub me scribbler, and denounce my Muse?
Prepare for rhyme—I'll publish, right or wrong:
Fools are my theme, let Satire be my song. [i]
Oh! Nature's noblest gift—my grey goose-quill!
Slave of my thoughts, obedient to my will,
Torn from thy parent bird to form a pen,
That mighty instrument of little men!

The pen! foredoomed to aid the mental throes
Of brains that labour, big with Verse or Prose;
Though Nymphs forsake, and Critics may deride,
The Lover's solace, and the Author's pride.
What Wits! what Poets dost thou daily raise!
How frequent is thy use, how small thy praise!
Condemned at length to be forgotten quite,
With all the pages which 'twas thine to write.
But thou, at least, mine own especial pen! [ii]
Once laid aside, but now assumed again,

Our task complete, like Hamet's [4] shall be free;
Though spurned by others, yet beloved by me:
Then let us soar to-day; no common theme,
No Eastern vision, no distempered dream [5]

Smooth be the verse, and easy be the strain.
When Vice triumphant holds her sov'reign sway,
Obey'd by all who nought beside obey; [iii]
When Folly, frequent harbinger of crime,
Bedecks her cap with bells of every Clime; [iv]

When knaves and fools combined o'er all prevail,
And weigh their Justice in a Golden Scale; [v]
E'en then the boldest start from public sneers,
Afraid of Shame, unknown to other fears,
More darkly sin, by Satire kept in awe,
And shrink from Ridicule, though not from Law.
Such is the force of Wit! I but not belong
To me the arrows of satiric song;
The royal vices of our age demand
A keener weapon, and a mightier hand. [vi]

Still there are follies, e'en for me to chase,
And yield at least amusement in the race:
Laugh when I laugh, I seek no other fame,
The cry is up, and scribblers are my game:
Speed, Pegasus!—ye strains of great and small,
Ode! Epic! Elegy!—have at you all!
I, too, can scrawl, and once upon a time
I poured along the town a flood of rhyme,
A schoolboy freak, unworthy praise or blame;
I printed—older children do the same.

'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
A Book's a Book, altho' there's nothing in't.
Not that a Title's sounding charm can save [vii]
Or scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave:
This LAMB [6] must own, since his patrician name
Failed to preserve the spurious Farce from shame. [7]
No matter, GEORGE continues still to write, [8]
Tho' now the name is veiled from public sight.
Moved by the great example, I pursue
The self-same road, but make my own review:

Not seek great JEFFREY'S, yet like him will be
Self-constituted Judge of Poesy.
A man must serve his time to every trade
Save Censure—Critics all are ready made.
Take hackneyed jokes from MILLER, [9] got by rote,
With just enough of learning to misquote;
A man well skilled to find, or forge a fault;
A turn for punning—call it Attic salt;
To JEFFREY go, be silent and discreet,
His pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet:

Fear not to lie,'twill seem a sharper hit; [viii]
Shrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;
Care not for feeling—pass your proper jest,
And stand a Critic, hated yet caress'd.
And shall we own such judgment? no—as soon
Seek roses in December—ice in June;
Hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff,
Believe a woman or an epitaph,
Or any other thing that's false, before
You trust in Critics, who themselves are sore;

Or yield one single thought to be misled
By JEFFREY'S heart, or LAMB'S Boeotian head. [10]
To these young tyrants, by themselves misplaced,
Combined usurpers on the Throne of Taste;
To these, when Authors bend in humble awe,
And hail their voice as Truth, their word as Law;
While these are Censors, 'twould be sin to spare; [11]
While such are Critics, why should I forbear?
But yet, so near all modern worthies run,
'Tis doubtful whom to seek, or whom to shun;

Nor know we when to spare, or where to strike,
Our Bards and Censors are so much alike.
Then should you ask me, [12] why I venture o'er
The path which POPE and GIFFORD [13] trod before;
If not yet sickened, you can still proceed;
Go on; my rhyme will tell you as you read.
""But hold!"" exclaims a friend,—""here's some neglect:
This—that—and t'other line seem incorrect.""
What then? the self-same blunder Pope has got,
And careless Dryden—""Aye, but Pye has not:""—

Indeed!—'tis granted, faith!—but what care I?
Better to err with POPE, than shine with PYE. [14]
Time was, ere yet in these degenerate days [15]
Ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise,
When Sense and Wit with Poesy allied,
No fabled Graces, flourished side by side,
From the same fount their inspiration drew,
And, reared by Taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.
Then, in this happy Isle, a POPE'S pure strain
Sought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain;

A polished nation's praise aspired to claim,
And raised the people's, as the poet's fame.
Like him great DRYDEN poured the tide of song,
In stream less smooth, indeed, yet doubly strong.
Then CONGREVE'S scenes could cheer, or OTWAY'S melt; [16]
For Nature then an English audience felt—
But why these names, or greater still, retrace,
When all to feebler Bards resign their place?
Yet to such times our lingering looks are cast,
When taste and reason with those times are past.

Now look around, and turn each trifling page,
Survey the precious works that please the age;
This truth at least let Satire's self allow,
No dearth of Bards can be complained of now. [ix]
The loaded Press beneath her labour groans, [x]
And Printers' devils shake their weary bones;
While SOUTHEY'S Epics cram the creaking shelves, [xi]
And LITTLE'S Lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves. [17]
Thus saith the Preacher: ""Nought beneath the sun
Is new,"" [18] yet still from change to change we run.

What varied wonders tempt us as they pass!
The Cow-pox, Tractors, Galvanism, and Gas, [19]
In turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,
Till the swoln bubble bursts—and all is air!
Nor less new schools of Poetry arise,
Where dull pretenders grapple for the prize:
O'er Taste awhile these Pseudo-bards prevail; [xii]
Each country Book-club bows the knee to Baal,
And, hurling lawful Genius from the throne,
Erects a shrine and idol of its own; [xiii]

Some leaden calf—but whom it matters not,
From soaring SOUTHEY, down to groveling STOTT. [20]
Behold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,
For notice eager, pass in long review:
Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,
And Rhyme and Blank maintain an equal race;
Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;
And Tales of Terror [21] jostle on the road;
Immeasurable measures move along;
For simpering Folly loves a varied song,

To strange, mysterious Dulness still the friend,
Admires the strain she cannot comprehend.
Thus Lays of Minstrels [22]—may they be the last!—
On half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast.
While mountain spirits prate to river sprites,
That dames may listen to the sound at nights;
And goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's [23] brood
Decoy young Border-nobles through the wood,
And skip at every step, Lord knows how high,
And frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why;

While high-born ladies in their magic cell,
Forbidding Knights to read who cannot spell,
Despatch a courier to a wizard's grave,
And fight with honest men to shield a knave.
Next view in state, proud prancing on his roan,
The golden-crested haughty Marmion,
Now forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,
Not quite a Felon, yet but half a Knight. [xiv]
The gibbet or the field prepared to grace;
A mighty mixture of the great and base.

And think'st thou, SCOTT! by vain conceit perchance,
On public taste to foist thy stale romance,
Though MURRAY with his MILLER may combine
To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line? [24]
No! when the sons of song descend to trade,
Their bays are sear, their former laurels fade,
Let such forego the poet's sacred name,
Who rack their brains for lucre, not for fame:
Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain! [25]
And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain! 180
Such be their meed, such still the just reward [xv]
Of prostituted Muse and hireling bard!
For this we spurn Apollo's venal son,
And bid a long ""good night to Marmion."" [26]
These are the themes that claim our plaudits now;
These are the Bards to whom the Muse must bow;
While MILTON, DRYDEN, POPE, alike forgot,
Resign their hallowed Bays to WALTER SCOTT.
The time has been, when yet the Muse was young,
When HOMER swept the lyre, and MARO sung,

An Epic scarce ten centuries could claim,
While awe-struck nations hailed the magic name:
The work of each immortal Bard appears
The single wonder of a thousand years. [27]
Empires have mouldered from the face of earth,
Tongues have expired with those who gave them birth,
Without the glory such a strain can give,
As even in ruin bids the language live.
Not so with us, though minor Bards, content, [xvi]
On one great work a life of labour spent:

With eagle pinion soaring to the skies,
Behold the Ballad-monger SOUTHEY rise!
To him let CAMOËNS, MILTON, TASSO yield,
Whose annual strains, like armies, take the field.
First in the ranks see Joan of Arc advance,
The scourge of England and the boast of France!
Though burnt by wicked BEDFORD for a witch,
Behold her statue placed in Glory's niche;
Her fetters burst, and just released from prison,
A virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.

Next see tremendous Thalaba come on, [28]
Arabia's monstrous, wild, and wond'rous son;
Domdaniel's dread destroyer, who o'erthrew
More mad magicians than the world e'er knew.
Immortal Hero! all thy foes o'ercome,
For ever reign—the rival of Tom Thumb! [29]
Since startled Metre fled before thy face,
Well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race!
Well might triumphant Genii bear thee hence,
Illustrious conqueror of common sense!

Now, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,
Cacique in Mexico, [30] and Prince in Wales;
Tells us strange tales, as other travellers do,
More old than Mandeville's, and not so true.
Oh, SOUTHEY! SOUTHEY! [31] cease thy varied song!
A bard may chaunt too often and too long:
As thou art strong in verse, in mercy, spare!
A fourth, alas! were more than we could bear.
But if, in spite of all the world can say,
Thou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way;

If still in Berkeley-Ballads most uncivil,
Thou wilt devote old women to the devil, [32]
The babe unborn thy dread intent may rue:
""God help thee,"" SOUTHEY, [33] and thy readers too.
Next comes the dull disciple of thy school, [34]
That mild apostate from poetic rule,
The simple WORDSWORTH, framer of a lay
As soft as evening in his favourite May,
Who warns his friend ""to shake off toil and trouble,
And quit his books, for fear of growing double;"" [35]

Who, both by precept and example, shows
That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;
Convincing all, by demonstration plain,
Poetic souls delight in prose insane;
And Christmas stories tortured into rhyme
Contain the essence of the true sublime.
Thus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,
The idiot mother of ""an idiot Boy;""
A moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way,
And, like his bard, confounded night with day [36]

So close on each pathetic part he dwells,
And each adventure so sublimely tells,
That all who view the ""idiot in his glory""
Conceive the Bard the hero of the story.
Shall gentle COLERIDGE pass unnoticed here, [37]
To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?
Though themes of innocence amuse him best,
Yet still Obscurity's a welcome guest.
If Inspiration should her aid refuse
To him who takes a Pixy for a muse, [38]

Yet none in lofty numbers can surpass
The bard who soars to elegize an ass:
So well the subject suits his noble mind, [xvii]
He brays, the Laureate of the long-eared kind. [xviii]
Oh! wonder-working LEWIS! [39] Monk, or Bard,
Who fain would make Parnassus a church-yard! [xix]
Lo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow,
Thy Muse a Sprite, Apollo's sexton thou!
Whether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,
By gibb'ring spectres hailed, thy kindred band;

Or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,
To please the females of our modest age;
All hail, M.P.! [40] from whose infernal brain
Thin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;
At whose command ""grim women"" throng in crowds,
And kings of fire, of water, and of clouds,
With ""small grey men,""—""wild yagers,"" and what not,
To crown with honour thee and WALTER SCOTT:
Again, all hail! if tales like thine may please,
St. Luke alone can vanquish the disease:

Even Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell,
And in thy skull discern a deeper Hell.
Who in soft guise, surrounded by a choir
Of virgins melting, not to Vesta's fire,
With sparkling eyes, and cheek by passion flushed
Strikes his wild lyre, whilst listening dames are hushed?
'Tis LITTLE! young Catullus of his day,
As sweet, but as immoral, in his Lay!
Grieved to condemn, the Muse must still be just,
Nor spare melodious advocates of lust.

Pure is the flame which o'er her altar burns;
From grosser incense with disgust she turns
Yet kind to youth, this expiation o'er,
She bids thee ""mend thy line, and sin no more."" [xx]
For thee, translator of the tinsel song,
To whom such glittering ornaments belong,
Hibernian STRANGFORD! with thine eyes of blue, [41]
And boasted locks of red or auburn hue,
Whose plaintive strain each love-sick Miss admires,
And o'er harmonious fustian half expires, [xxi]

Learn, if thou canst, to yield thine author's sense,
Nor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence.
Think'st thou to gain thy verse a higher place,
By dressing Camoëns [42] in a suit of lace?
Mend, STRANGFORD! mend thy morals and thy taste;
Be warm, but pure; be amorous, but be chaste:
Cease to deceive; thy pilfered harp restore,
Nor teach the Lusian Bard to copy MOORE.
Behold—Ye Tarts!—one moment spare the text! [xxii]—
HAYLEY'S last work, and worst—until his next;

Whether he spin poor couplets into plays,
Or damn the dead with purgatorial praise, [43]
His style in youth or age is still the same,
For ever feeble and for ever tame.
Triumphant first see ""Temper's Triumphs"" shine!
At least I'm sure they triumphed over mine.
Of ""Music's Triumphs,"" all who read may swear
That luckless Music never triumph'd there. [44]
Moravians, rise! bestow some meet reward [45]
On dull devotion—Lo! the Sabbath Bard,

Sepulchral GRAHAME, [46] pours his notes sublime
In mangled prose, nor e'en aspires to rhyme;
Breaks into blank the Gospel of St. Luke, [xxiii]
And boldly pilfers from the Pentateuch;
And, undisturbed by conscientious qualms,
Perverts the Prophets, and purloins the Psalms.
Hail, Sympathy! thy soft idea brings"" [xxiv]
A thousand visions of a thousand things,
And shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years, [xxv]
The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers. 330
And art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles! [47]
Thou first, great oracle of tender souls?
Whether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief, [xxvi]
The fall of empires, or a yellow leaf;
Whether thy muse most lamentably tells
What merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells, [xxvii]
Or, still in bells delighting, finds a friend
In every chime that jingled from Ostend;
Ah! how much juster were thy Muse's hap,
If to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap! [xxviii]

Delightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest,
All love thy strain, but children like it best.
'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song,
To soothe the mania of the amorous throng!
With thee our nursery damsels shed their tears,
Ere Miss as yet completes her infant years:
But in her teens thy whining powers are vain;
She quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain.
Now to soft themes thou scornest to confine [xxix]
The lofty numbers of a harp like thine;

""Awake a louder and a loftier strain,"" [48]
Such as none heard before, or will again!
Where all discoveries jumbled from the flood,
Since first the leaky ark reposed in mud,
By more or less, are sung in every book,
From Captain Noah down to Captain Cook.
Nor this alone—but, pausing on the road,
The Bard sighs forth a gentle episode, [xxx] [49]
And gravely tells—attend, each beauteous Miss!—
When first Madeira trembled to a kiss. 360
Bowles! in thy memory let this precept dwell,
Stick to thy Sonnets, Man!—at least they sell.
But if some new-born whim, or larger bribe,
Prompt thy crude brain, and claim thee for a scribe:
If 'chance some bard, though once by dunces feared,
Now, prone in dust, can only be revered;
If Pope, whose fame and genius, from the first, [xxxi]
Have foiled the best of critics, needs the worst,
Do thou essay: each fault, each failing scan;
The first of poets was, alas! but man.

Rake from each ancient dunghill ev'ry pearl,
Consult Lord Fanny, and confide in CURLL; [50]
Let all the scandals of a former age
Perch on thy pen, and flutter o'er thy page;
Affect a candour which thou canst not feel,
Clothe envy in a garb of honest zeal;
Write, as if St. John's soul could still inspire,
And do from hate what MALLET [51] did for hire.
Oh! hadst thou lived in that congenial time
To rave with DENNIS, and with RALPH to rhyme; [52]

Thronged with the rest around his living head,
Not raised thy hoof against the lion dead,
A meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains,
And linked thee to the Dunciad for thy pains. [53]
Another Epic! Who inflicts again
More books of blank upon the sons of men?
Boeotian COTTLE, rich Bristowa's boast,
Imports old stories from the Cambrian coast,
And sends his goods to market—all alive!
Lines forty thousand, Cantos twenty-five!

Fresh fish from Hippocrene! [54] who'll buy? who'll buy?
The precious bargain's cheap—in faith, not I.
Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat, [xxxii]
Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat;
If Commerce fills the purse, she clogs the brain,
And AMOS COTTLE strikes the Lyre in vain.
In him an author's luckless lot behold!
Condemned to make the books which once he sold.
Oh, AMOS COTTLE!—Phoebus! what a name
To fill the speaking-trump of future fame!—

Oh, AMOS COTTLE! for a moment think
What meagre profits spring from pen and ink!
When thus devoted to poetic dreams,
Who will peruse thy prostituted reams?
Oh! pen perverted! paper misapplied!
Had COTTLE [55] still adorned the counter's side,
Bent o'er the desk, or, born to useful toils,
Been taught to make the paper which he soils,
Ploughed, delved, or plied the oar with lusty limb,
He had not sung of Wales, nor I of him.

As Sisyphus against the infernal steep
Rolls the huge rock whose motions ne'er may sleep,
So up thy hill, ambrosial Richmond! heaves
Dull MAURICE [56] all his granite weight of leaves:
Smooth, solid monuments of mental pain!
The petrifactions of a plodding brain,
That, ere they reach the top, fall lumbering back again.
With broken lyre and cheek serenely pale,
Lo! sad Alcæus wanders down the vale;
Though fair they rose, and might have bloomed at last,

His hopes have perished by the northern blast:
Nipped in the bud by Caledonian gales,
His blossoms wither as the blast prevails!
O'er his lost works let classic SHEFFIELD weep;
May no rude hand disturb their early sleep! [57]
Yet say! why should the Bard, at once, resign [xxxiii]
His claim to favour from the sacred Nine?
For ever startled by the mingled howl
Of Northern Wolves, that still in darkness prowl;
A coward Brood, which mangle as they prey,

By hellish instinct, all that cross their way;
Aged or young, the living or the dead,"" [xxxiv]
No mercy find-these harpies must be fed.
Why do the injured unresisting yield
The calm possession of their native field?
Why tamely thus before their fangs retreat,
Nor hunt the blood-hounds back to Arthur's Seat? [58]
Health to immortal JEFFREY! once, in name,
England could boast a judge almost the same; [59]
In soul so like, so merciful, yet just,
Some think that Satan has resigned his trust,
And given the Spirit to the world again,
To sentence Letters, as he sentenced men.
With hand less mighty, but with heart as black,
With voice as willing to decree the rack;
Bred in the Courts betimes, though all that law
As yet hath taught him is to find a flaw,—
Since well instructed in the patriot school
To rail at party, though a party tool—
Who knows? if chance his patrons should restore

Back to the sway they forfeited before,
His scribbling toils some recompense may meet,
And raise this Daniel to the Judgment-Seat. [60]
Let JEFFREY'S shade indulge the pious hope,
And greeting thus, present him with a rope:
""Heir to my virtues! man of equal mind!
Skilled to condemn as to traduce mankind,
This cord receive! for thee reserved with care,
To wield in judgment, and at length to wear.""
Health to great JEFFREY! Heaven preserve his life,

To flourish on the fertile shores of Fife,
And guard it sacred in its future wars,
Since authors sometimes seek the field of Mars!
Can none remember that eventful day, [xxxv] [61]
That ever-glorious, almost fatal fray,
When LITTLE'S leadless pistol met his eye, [62]
And Bow-street Myrmidons stood laughing by?
Oh, day disastrous! on her firm-set rock,
Dunedin's castle felt a secret shock;
Dark rolled the sympathetic waves of Forth,

Low groaned the startled whirlwinds of the north;
TWEED ruffled half his waves to form a tear,
The other half pursued his calm career; [63]
ARTHUR'S steep summit nodded to its base,
The surly Tolbooth scarcely kept her place.
The Tolbooth felt—for marble sometimes can,
On such occasions, feel as much as man—
The Tolbooth felt defrauded of his charms,
If JEFFREY died, except within her arms: [64]

Nay last, not least, on that portentous morn,
The sixteenth story, where himself was born,
His patrimonial garret, fell to ground,
And pale Edina shuddered at the sound:
Strewed were the streets around with milk-white reams,
Flowed all the Canongate with inky streams;
This of his candour seemed the sable dew,
That of his valour showed the bloodless hue;
And all with justice deemed the two combined
The mingled emblems of his mighty mind.
But Caledonia's goddess hovered o'er

The field, and saved him from the wrath of Moore;
From either pistol snatched the vengeful lead,
And straight restored it to her favourite's head;
That head, with greater than magnetic power,
Caught it, as Danäe caught the golden shower,
And, though the thickening dross will scarce refine,
Augments its ore, and is itself a mine.
""My son,"" she cried, ""ne'er thirst for gore again,
Resign the pistol and resume the pen;
O'er politics and poesy preside,

Boast of thy country, and Britannia's guide!
For long as Albion's heedless sons submit,
Or Scottish taste decides on English wit,
So long shall last thine unmolested reign,
Nor any dare to take thy name in vain.
Behold, a chosen band shall aid thy plan,
And own thee chieftain of the critic clan.
First in the oat-fed phalanx [65] shall be seen
The travelled Thane, Athenian Aberdeen. [66]
HERBERT shall wield THOR'S hammer, [67] and sometimes

In gratitude, thou'lt praise his rugged rhymes.
Smug SYDNEY [68] too thy bitter page shall seek,
And classic HALLAM, [69] much renowned for Greek;
SCOTT may perchance his name and influence lend,
And paltry PILLANS [70] shall traduce his friend;
While gay Thalia's luckless votary, LAMB, [xxxvi] [71]
Damned like the Devil—Devil-like will damn.
Known be thy name! unbounded be thy sway!
Thy HOLLAND'S banquets shall each toil repay!
While grateful Britain yields the praise she owes

To HOLLAND'S hirelings and to Learning's foes.
Yet mark one caution ere thy next Review
Spread its light wings of Saffron and of Blue,
Beware lest blundering BROUGHAM [72] destroy the sale,
Turn Beef to Bannocks, Cauliflowers to Kail.""
Thus having said, the kilted Goddess kist
Her son, and vanished in a Scottish mist. [73]
Then prosper, JEFFREY! pertest of the train [74]
Whom Scotland pampers with her fiery grain!
Whatever blessing waits a genuine Scot, 530
In double portion swells thy glorious lot;
For thee Edina culls her evening sweets,
And showers their odours on thy candid sheets,
Whose Hue and Fragrance to thy work adhere—
This scents its pages, and that gilds its rear. [75]
Lo! blushing Itch, coy nymph, enamoured grown,
Forsakes the rest, and cleaves to thee alone,
And, too unjust to other Pictish men,
Enjoys thy person, and inspires thy pen!
Illustrious HOLLAND! hard would be his lot,

His hirelings mentioned, and himself forgot! [76]
HOLLAND, with HENRY PETTY [77] at his back,
The whipper-in and huntsman of the pack.
Blest be the banquets spread at Holland House,
Where Scotchmen feed, and Critics may carouse!
Long, long beneath that hospitable roof [xxxvii]
Shall Grub-street dine, while duns are kept aloof.
See honest HALLAM [78] lay aside his fork,
Resume his pen, review his Lordship's work,
And, grateful for the dainties on his plate, [xxxviii]

Declare his landlord can at least translate! [79]
Dunedin! view thy children with delight,
They write for food—and feed because they write: [xxxix]
And lest, when heated with the unusual grape,
Some glowing thoughts should to the press escape,
And tinge with red the female reader's cheek,
My lady skims the cream of each critique;
Breathes o'er the page her purity of soul,
Reforms each error, and refines the whole. [80]
Now to the Drama turn—Oh! motley sight!

What precious scenes the wondering eyes invite:
Puns, and a Prince within a barrel pent, [xl] [81]
And Dibdin's nonsense yield complete content. [82]
Though now, thank Heaven! the Rosciomania's o'er. [83]
And full-grown actors are endured once more;
Yet what avail their vain attempts to please,
While British critics suffer scenes like these;
While REYNOLDS vents his ""'dammes!'"" ""poohs!"" and
""zounds!"" [xli] [84]

And common-place and common sense confounds?
While KENNEY'S [85] ""World""—ah! where is KENNEY'S wit? [xlii]— 570
Tires the sad gallery, lulls the listless Pit;
And BEAUMONT'S pilfered Caratach affords
A tragedy complete in all but words? [xliii]
Who but must mourn, while these are all the rage
The degradation of our vaunted stage?
Heavens! is all sense of shame and talent gone?
Have we no living Bard of merit?—none?
Awake, GEORGE COLMAN! [86] CUMBERLAND, awake![87]
Ring the alarum bell! let folly quake!
Oh! SHERIDAN! if aught can move thy pen,

Let Comedy assume her throne again; [xliv]
Abjure the mummery of German schools;
Leave new Pizarros to translating fools; [88]
Give, as thy last memorial to the age,
One classic drama, and reform the stage.
Gods! o'er those boards shall Folly rear her head,
Where GARRICK trod, and SIDDONS lives to tread? [xlv] [89]
On those shall Farce display buffoonery's mask,
And HOOK conceal his heroes in a cask? [90]
Shall sapient managers new scenes produce

From CHERRY, [91] SKEFFINGTON, [92] and Mother GOOSE? [xlvi] [93]
While SHAKESPEARE, OTWAY, MASSINGER, forgot,
On stalls must moulder, or in closets rot?
Lo! with what pomp the daily prints proclaim
The rival candidates for Attic fame!
In grim array though LEWIS' spectres rise,
Still SKEFFINGTON and GOOSE divide the prize.
And sure 'great' Skeffington must claim our praise,
For skirtless coats and skeletons of plays
Renowned alike; whose genius ne'er confines

Her flight to garnish Greenwood's gay designs; [xlvii] [94]
Nor sleeps with ""Sleeping Beauties,"" but anon
In five facetious acts comes thundering on.
While poor John Bull, bewildered with the scene,
Stares, wondering what the devil it can mean;
But as some hands applaud, a venal few!
Rather than sleep, why John applauds it too.
Such are we now. Ah! wherefore should we turn
To what our fathers were, unless to mourn?
Degenerate Britons! are ye dead to shame,

Or, kind to dulness, do you fear to blame?
Well may the nobles of our present race
Watch each distortion of a NALDI'S face;
Well may they smile on Italy's buffoons,
And worship CATALANI's pantaloons, [95]
Since their own Drama yields no fairer trace
Of wit than puns, of humour than grimace. [96]
Then let Ausonia, skill'd in every art
To soften manners, but corrupt the heart,
Pour her exotic follies o'er the town,

To sanction Vice, and hunt Decorum down:
Let wedded strumpets languish o'er DESHAYES,
And bless the promise which his form displays;
While Gayton bounds before th' enraptured looks
Of hoary Marquises, and stripling Dukes:
Let high-born lechers eye the lively Presle
Twirl her light limbs, that spurn the needless veil;
Let Angiolini bare her breast of snow,
Wave the white arm, and point the pliant toe;
Collini trill her love-inspiring song,

Strain her fair neck, and charm the listening throng!
Whet [97] not your scythe, Suppressors of our Vice!
Reforming Saints! too delicately nice!
By whose decrees, our sinful souls to save,
No Sunday tankards foam, no barbers shave;
And beer undrawn, and beards unmown, display
Your holy reverence for the Sabbath-day.
Or hail at once the patron and the pile
Of vice and folly, Greville and Argyle! [98]
Where yon proud palace, Fashion's hallow'd fane,

Spreads wide her portals for the motley train,
Behold the new Petronius [99] of the day, [xlviii]
Our arbiter of pleasure and of play!
There the hired eunuch, the Hesperian choir,
The melting lute, the soft lascivious lyre,
The song from Italy, the step from France,
The midnight orgy, and the mazy dance,
The smile of beauty, and the flush of wine,
For fops, fools, gamesters, knaves, and Lords combine:
Each to his humour—Comus all allows; 650
Champaign, dice, music, or your neighbour's spouse.
Talk not to us, ye starving sons of trade!
Of piteous ruin, which ourselves have made;
In Plenty's sunshine Fortune's minions bask,
Nor think of Poverty, except ""en masque,"" [100]
When for the night some lately titled ass
Appears the beggar which his grandsire was,
The curtain dropped, the gay Burletta o'er,
The audience take their turn upon the floor:
Now round the room the circling dow'gers sweep,

Now in loose waltz the thin-clad daughters leap;
The first in lengthened line majestic swim,
The last display the free unfettered limb!
Those for Hibernia's lusty sons repair
With art the charms which Nature could not spare;
These after husbands wing their eager flight,
Nor leave much mystery for the nuptial night.
Oh! blest retreats of infamy and ease,
Where, all forgotten but the power to please,
Each maid may give a loose to genial thought,

Each swain may teach new systems, or be taught:
There the blithe youngster, just returned from Spain,
Cuts the light pack, or calls the rattling main;
The jovial Caster's set, and seven's the Nick,
Or—done!—a thousand on the coming trick!
If, mad with loss, existence 'gins to tire,
And all your hope or wish is to expire,
Here's POWELL'S [101] pistol ready for your life,
And, kinder still, two PAGETS for your wife: [xlix]
Fit consummation of an earthly race

Begun in folly, ended in disgrace,
While none but menials o'er the bed of death,
Wash thy red wounds, or watch thy wavering breath;
Traduced by liars, and forgot by all,
The mangled victim of a drunken brawl,
To live like CLODIUS, [102] and like FALKLAND fall.[103]
Truth! rouse some genuine Bard, and guide his hand
To drive this pestilence from out the land.
E'en I—least thinking of a thoughtless throng,
Just skilled to know the right and choose the wrong,

Freed at that age when Reason's shield is lost,
To fight my course through Passion's countless host, [104]
Whom every path of Pleasure's flow'ry way
Has lured in turn, and all have led astray—
E'en I must raise my voice, e'en I must feel
Such scenes, such men, destroy the public weal:
Altho' some kind, censorious friend will say,
""What art thou better, meddling fool, [105] than they?""
And every Brother Rake will smile to see
That miracle, a Moralist in me.

No matter—when some Bard in virtue strong,
Gifford perchance, shall raise the chastening song,
Then sleep my pen for ever! and my voice
Be only heard to hail him, and rejoice,
Rejoice, and yield my feeble praise, though I
May feel the lash that Virtue must apply.
As for the smaller fry, who swarm in shoals
From silly HAFIZ up to simple BOWLES, [106]
Why should we call them from their dark abode,
In Broad St. Giles's or Tottenham-Road?

Or (since some men of fashion nobly dare
To scrawl in verse) from Bond-street or the Square? [l]
If things of Ton their harmless lays indite,
Most wisely doomed to shun the public sight,
What harm? in spite of every critic elf,
Sir T. may read his stanzas to himself;
MILES ANDREWS [107] still his strength in couplets try,
And live in prologues, though his dramas die.
Lords too are Bards: such things at times befall,
And 'tis some praise in Peers to write at all.

Yet, did or Taste or Reason sway the times,
Ah! who would take their titles with their rhymes? [108]
ROSCOMMON! [109] SHEFFIELD! [110] with your spirits fled, [111]
No future laurels deck a noble head;
No Muse will cheer, with renovating smile,
The paralytic puling of CARLISLE. [li] [112]
The puny schoolboy and his early lay
Men pardon, if his follies pass away;
But who forgives the Senior's ceaseless verse
Whose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse?

What heterogeneous honours deck the Peer!
Lord, rhymester, petit-maître, pamphleteer! [113]
So dull in youth, so drivelling in his age,
His scenes alone had damned our sinking stage;
But Managers for once cried, ""Hold, enough!""
Nor drugged their audience with the tragic stuff.
Yet at their judgment let his Lordship laugh, [lii]
And case his volumes in congenial calf;
Yes! doff that covering, where Morocco shines,
And hang a calf-skin on those recreant lines. [114]

With you, ye Druids! rich in native lead,
Who daily scribble for your daily bread:
With you I war not: GIFFORD'S heavy hand
Has crushed, without remorse, your numerous band.
On ""All the Talents"" vent your venal spleen; [115]
Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.
Let Monodies on Fox regale your crew,
And Melville's Mantle [116] prove a Blanket too!
One common Lethe waits each hapless Bard,
And, peace be with you! 'tis your best reward.

Such damning fame; as Dunciads only give [liii]
Could bid your lines beyond a morning live;
But now at once your fleeting labours close,
With names of greater note in blest repose.
Far be't from me unkindly to upbraid
The lovely ROSA'S prose in masquerade,
Whose strains, the faithful echoes of her mind,
Leave wondering comprehension far behind. [117]
Though Crusca's bards no more our journals fill, [118]
Some stragglers skirmish round the columns still;

Last of the howling host which once was Bell's, [liv]
Matilda snivels yet, and Hafiz yells;
And Merry's [119] metaphors appear anew,
Chained to the signature of O. P. Q. [120]
When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,
Employs a pen less pointed than his awl,
Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes,
St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the Muse,
Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud!
How ladies read, and Literati laud! [121]

If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest,
'Tis sheer ill-nature—don't the world know best?
Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme,
And CAPEL LOFFT [122] declares 'tis quite sublime.
Hear, then, ye happy sons of needless trade!
Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade!
Lo! BURNS and BLOOMFIELD, nay, a greater far,
GIFFORD was born beneath an adverse star,
Forsook the labours of a servile state,
Stemmed the rude storm, and triumphed over Fate:

Then why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you,
BLOOMFIELD! why not on brother Nathan too? [123]
Him too the Mania, not the Muse, has seized;
Not inspiration, but a mind diseased:
And now no Boor can seek his last abode,
No common be inclosed without an ode.
Oh! since increased refinement deigns to smile
On Britain's sons, and bless our genial Isle,
Let Poesy go forth, pervade the whole,
Alike the rustic, and mechanic soul!

Ye tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong,
Compose at once a slipper and a song;
So shall the fair your handywork peruse,
Your sonnets sure shall please—perhaps your shoes.
May Moorland weavers [124] boast Pindaric skill,
And tailors' lays be longer than their bill!
While punctual beaux reward the grateful notes,
And pay for poems—when they pay for coats.
To the famed throng now paid the tribute due, [lv]
Neglected Genius! let me turn to you.

Come forth, oh CAMPBELL! give thy talents scope;
Who dares aspire if thou must cease to hope?
And thou, melodious ROGERS! rise at last,
Recall the pleasing memory of the past; [125]
Arise! let blest remembrance still inspire,
And strike to wonted tones thy hallowed lyre;
Restore Apollo to his vacant throne,
Assert thy country's honour and thine own.
What! must deserted Poesy still weep
Where her last hopes with pious COWPER sleep?

Unless, perchance, from his cold bier she turns,
To deck the turf that wraps her minstrel, BURNS!
No! though contempt hath marked the spurious brood,
The race who rhyme from folly, or for food,
Yet still some genuine sons 'tis hers to boast,
Who, least affecting, still affect the most: [lvi]
Feel as they write, and write but as they feel—
Bear witness GIFFORD, [126] SOTHEBY, [127] MACNEIL. [128]
""Why slumbers GIFFORD?"" once was asked in vain;
Why slumbers GIFFORD? let us ask again. [129]

Are there no follies for his pen to purge?
Are there no fools whose backs demand the scourge?
Are there no sins for Satire's Bard to greet?
Stalks not gigantic Vice in every street?
Shall Peers or Princes tread pollution's path,
And 'scape alike the Laws and Muse's wrath?
Nor blaze with guilty glare through future time,
Eternal beacons of consummate crime?
Arouse thee, GIFFORD! be thy promise claimed,
Make bad men better, or at least ashamed.

Unhappy WHITE! [130] while life was in its spring,
And thy young Muse just waved her joyous wing,
The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away, [lvii] [131]
Which else had sounded an immortal lay.
Oh! what a noble heart was here undone,
When Science' self destroyed her favourite son!
Yes, she too much indulged thy fond pursuit,
She sowed the seeds, but Death has reaped the fruit.
'Twas thine own Genius gave the final blow,
And helped to plant the wound that laid thee low:

So the struck Eagle, stretched upon the plain,
No more through rolling clouds to soar again,
Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart,
And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart;
Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel
He nursed the pinion which impelled the steel;
While the same plumage that had warmed his nest
Drank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast.
There be who say, in these enlightened days,
That splendid lies are all the poet's praise;

That strained Invention, ever on the wing,
Alone impels the modern Bard to sing:
Tis true, that all who rhyme—nay, all who write,
Shrink from that fatal word to Genius—Trite;
Yet Truth sometimes will lend her noblest fires,
And decorate the verse herself inspires:
This fact in Virtue's name let CRABBE [132] attest;
Though Nature's sternest Painter, yet the best.
And here let SHEE [133] and Genius find a place,
Whose pen and pencil yield an equal grace;

To guide whose hand the sister Arts combine,
And trace the Poet's or the Painter's line;
Whose magic touch can bid the canvas glow,
Or pour the easy rhyme's harmonious flow;
While honours, doubly merited, attend [lviii]
The Poet's rival, but the Painter's friend.
Blest is the man who dares approach the bower
Where dwelt the Muses at their natal hour;
Whose steps have pressed, whose eye has marked afar,
The clime that nursed the sons of song and war,

The scenes which Glory still must hover o'er,
Her place of birth, her own Achaian shore.
But doubly blest is he whose heart expands
With hallowed feelings for those classic lands;
Who rends the veil of ages long gone by,
And views their remnants with a poet's eye!
WRIGHT! [134] 'twas thy happy lot at once to view
Those shores of glory, and to sing them too;
And sure no common Muse inspired thy pen
To hail the land of Gods and Godlike men. 880
And you, associate Bards! [135] who snatched to light [lvix]
Those gems too long withheld from modern sight;
Whose mingling taste combined to cull the wreath
While Attic flowers Aonian odours breathe,
And all their renovated fragrance flung,
To grace the beauties of your native tongue;
Now let those minds, that nobly could transfuse
The glorious Spirit of the Grecian Muse,
Though soft the echo, scorn a borrowed tone: [lx]
Resign Achaia's lyre, and strike your own.

Let these, or such as these, with just applause, [lxi]
Restore the Muse's violated laws;
But not in flimsy DARWIN'S [136] pompous chime, [lxii]
That mighty master of unmeaning rhyme,
Whose gilded cymbals, more adorned than clear,
The eye delighted, but fatigued the ear,
In show the simple lyre could once surpass,
But now, worn down, appear in native brass;
While all his train of hovering sylphs around
Evaporate in similes and sound:

Him let them shun, with him let tinsel die:
False glare attracts, but more offends the eye. [137]
Yet let them not to vulgar WORDSWORTH [138] stoop,
The meanest object of the lowly group,
Whose verse, of all but childish prattle void,
Seems blessed harmony to LAMB and LLOYD: [139]
Let them—but hold, my Muse, nor dare to teach
A strain far, far beyond thy humble reach:
The native genius with their being given
Will point the path, and peal their notes to heaven. 910
And thou, too, SCOTT! [140] resign to minstrels rude
The wilder Slogan of a Border feud:
Let others spin their meagre lines for hire;
Enough for Genius, if itself inspire!
Let SOUTHEY sing, altho' his teeming muse, [lxiii]
Prolific every spring, be too profuse;
Let simple WORDSWORTH [141] chime his childish verse,
And brother COLERIDGE lull the babe at nurse [lxiv]
Let Spectre-mongering LEWIS aim, at most, [lxv]
To rouse the Galleries, or to raise a ghost;

Let MOORE still sigh; let STRANGFORD steal from MOORE, [lxvi]
And swear that CAMOËNS sang such notes of yore;
Let HAYLEY hobble on, MONTGOMERY rave,
And godly GRAHAME chant a stupid stave;
Let sonneteering BOWLES [142] his strains refine,
And whine and whimper to the fourteenth line;
Let STOTT, CARLISLE, [143] MATILDA, and the rest
Of Grub Street, and of Grosvenor Place the best,
Scrawl on, 'till death release us from the strain,
Or Common Sense assert her rights again;

But Thou, with powers that mock the aid of praise,
Should'st leave to humbler Bards ignoble lays:
Thy country's voice, the voice of all the Nine,
Demand a hallowed harp—that harp is thine.
Say! will not Caledonia's annals yield
The glorious record of some nobler field,
Than the vile foray of a plundering clan,
Whose proudest deeds disgrace the name of man?
Or Marmion's acts of darkness, fitter food
For SHERWOOD'S outlaw tales of ROBIN HOOD? [lxvii]

Scotland! still proudly claim thy native Bard,
And be thy praise his first, his best reward!
Yet not with thee alone his name should live,
But own the vast renown a world can give;
Be known, perchance, when Albion is no more,
And tell the tale of what she was before;
To future times her faded fame recall,
And save her glory, though his country fall.
Yet what avails the sanguine Poet's hope,
To conquer ages, and with time to cope?

New eras spread their wings, new nations rise,
And other Victors fill th' applauding skies; [144]
A few brief generations fleet along,
Whose sons forget the Poet and his song:
E'en now, what once-loved Minstrels scarce may claim
The transient mention of a dubious name!
When Fame's loud trump hath blown its noblest blast,
Though long the sound, the echo sleeps at last;
And glory, like the Phoenix [145] midst her fires,
Exhales her odours, blazes, and expires.

Shall hoary Granta call her sable sons,
Expert in science, more expert at puns?
Shall these approach the Muse? ah, no! she flies,
Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize; [lxviii]
Though Printers condescend the press to soil
With rhyme by HOARE, [146] and epic blank by HOYLE: [lxix] [147]
Not him whose page, if still upheld by whist,
Requires no sacred theme to bid us list. [148]
Ye! who in Granta's honours would surpass,
Must mount her Pegasus, a full-grown ass;

A foal well worthy of her ancient Dam,
Whose Helicon [149] is duller than her Cam. [lxx]
There CLARKE, [150] still striving piteously ""to please,"" [lxxi]
Forgetting doggerel leads not to degrees,
A would-be satirist, a hired Buffoon,
A monthly scribbler of some low Lampoon, [151]
Condemned to drudge, the meanest of the mean,
And furbish falsehoods for a magazine,
Devotes to scandal his congenial mind;
Himself a living libel on mankind.

Oh! dark asylum of a Vandal race! [152]
At once the boast of learning, and disgrace!
So lost to Phoebus, that nor Hodgson's [153] verse
Can make thee better, nor poor Hewson's [154] worse. [lxxii]
But where fair Isis rolls her purer wave,
The partial Muse delighted loves to lave;
On her green banks a greener wreath she wove, [lxxiii]
To crown the Bards that haunt her classic grove;
Where RICHARDS wakes a genuine poet's fires,
And modern Britons glory in their Sires. [155] [lxxiv]

For me, who, thus unasked, have dared to tell
My country, what her sons should know too well, [lxxv]
Zeal for her honour bade me here engage [lxxvi]
The host of idiots that infest her age;
No just applause her honoured name shall lose,
As first in freedom, dearest to the Muse.
Oh! would thy bards but emulate thy fame,
And rise more worthy, Albion, of thy name!
What Athens was in science, Rome in power,
What Tyre appeared in her meridian hour,

'Tis thine at once, fair Albion! to have been—
Earth's chief Dictatress, Ocean's lovely Queen: [lxxvii]
But Rome decayed, and Athens strewed the plain,
And Tyre's proud piers lie shattered in the main;
Like these, thy strength may sink, in ruin hurled, [lxxviii]
And Britain fall, the bulwark of the world.
But let me cease, and dread Cassandra's fate,
With warning ever scoffed at, till too late;
To themes less lofty still my lay confine,
And urge thy Bards to gain a name like thine. [156]

Then, hapless Britain! be thy rulers blest,
The senate's oracles, the people's jest!
Still hear thy motley orators dispense
The flowers of rhetoric, though not of sense,
While CANNING'S colleagues hate him for his wit,
And old dame PORTLAND [157] fills the place of PITT.
Yet once again, adieu! ere this the sail
That wafts me hence is shivering in the gale;
And Afric's coast and Calpe's adverse height, [158]
And Stamboul's minarets must greet my sight:

Thence shall I stray through Beauty's native clime, [159]
Where Kaff [160] is clad in rocks, and crowned with snows sublime.
But should I back return, no tempting press [lxxix]
Shall drag my Journal from the desk's recess;
Let coxcombs, printing as they come from far,
Snatch his own wreath of Ridicule from Carr;
Let ABERDEEN and ELGIN [161] still pursue
The shade of fame through regions of Virtù;
Waste useless thousands on their Phidian freaks,
Misshapen monuments and maimed antiques;

And make their grand saloons a general mart
For all the mutilated blocks of art:
Of Dardan tours let Dilettanti tell,
I leave topography to rapid [162] GELL; [163]
And, quite content, no more shall interpose
To stun the public ear—at least with Prose. [lxxx]
Thus far I've held my undisturbed career,
Prepared for rancour, steeled 'gainst selfish fear;
This thing of rhyme I ne'er disdained to own—
Though not obtrusive, yet not quite unknown:

My voice was heard again, though not so loud,
My page, though nameless, never disavowed;
And now at once I tear the veil away:—
Cheer on the pack! the Quarry stands at bay,
Unscared by all the din of MELBOURNE house, [164]
By LAMB'S resentment, or by HOLLAND'S spouse,
By JEFFREY'S harmless pistol, HALLAM'S rage,
Edina's brawny sons and brimstone page.
Our men in buckram shall have blows enough,
And feel they too are ""penetrable stuff:""

And though I hope not hence unscathed to go,
Who conquers me shall find a stubborn foe.
The time hath been, when no harsh sound would fall
From lips that now may seem imbued with gall;
Nor fools nor follies tempt me to despise
The meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes:
But now, so callous grown, so changed since youth,
I've learned to think, and sternly speak the truth;
Learned to deride the critic's starch decree,
And break him on the wheel he meant for me;

To spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss,
Nor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss:
Nay more, though all my rival rhymesters frown,
I too can hunt a Poetaster down;
And, armed in proof, the gauntlet cast at once
To Scotch marauder, and to Southern dunce.
Thus much I've dared; if my incondite lay [lxxx]
Hath wronged these righteous times, let others say:
This, let the world, which knows not how to spare,
Yet rarely blames unjustly, now declare. [165]

Mr. Fitzgerald, facetiously termed by Cobbett the ""Small Beer Poet,"" inflicts his annual tribute of verse on the Literary Fund: not content with writing, he spouts in person, after the company have imbibed a reasonable quantity of bad port, to enable them to sustain the operation.

[William Thomas Fitzgerald (circ. 1759-1829) played the part of unofficial poet laureate. His loyal recitations were reported by the newspapers. He published, 'inter alia', 'Nelson's Triumph' (1798), 'Tears of Hibernia, dispelled by the Union' (1802), and 'Nelson's Tomb' (1806). He owes his fame to the first line of 'English Bards', and the famous parody in 'Rejected Addresses'. The following 'jeux désprits' were transcribed by R. C. Dallas on a blank leaf of a copy of the Fifth Edition:—

""Written on a copy of 'English Bards' at the 'Alfred' by W. T.
Fitzgerald, Esq.—
I find Lord Byron scorns my Muse,
Our Fates are ill agreed;
The Verse is safe, I can't abuse
Those lines, I never read.
Signed W. T. F.""

Answer written on the same page by Lord Byron—

""What's writ on me,"" cries Fitz, ""I never read""!
What's writ by thee, dear Fitz, none will, indeed.
The case stands simply thus, then, honest Fitz,
Thou and thine enemies are fairly quits;
Or rather would be, if for time to come,
They luckily were 'deaf', or thou wert dumb;
But to their pens while scribblers add their tongues.
The Waiter only can escape their lungs. [A]]

[Footnote 6: ""He's a very good fellow; and, except his mother and sister, the best of the set, to my mind.""—B., 1816. [William (1779-1848) and George (1784-1834) Lamb, sons of Sir Peniston Lamb (Viscount Melbourne, 1828), by Elizabeth, only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, were Lady Byron's first cousins. William married, in 1805, Lady Caroline Ponsonby, the writer of 'Glenarvon'. George, who was one of the early contributors to the 'Edinburgh Review', married in 1809 Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St. Jules. At the time of the separation, Lady Caroline Lamb and Mrs. George Lamb warmly espoused Lady Byron's cause, Lady Melbourne and her daughter Lady Cowper (afterwards Lady Palmerston) were rather against than for Lady Byron. William Lamb was discreetly silent, and George Lamb declaimed against Lady Byron, calling her a d——d fool. Hence Lord Byron's praises of George. Cf. line 517 of 'English Bards'.]

""Spurious Brat"" [see variant ii. p. 300], that is the farce; the ingenuous youth who begat it is mentioned more particularly with his offspring in another place. ['Note. MS. M.'] [The farce 'Whistle for It' was performed two or three times at Covent Garden Theatre in 1807.]

[Footnote 10: Messrs. Jeffrey and Lamb are the alpha and omega, the first and last of the 'Edinburgh Review'; the others are mentioned hereafter.

[The MS. Note is as follows:—""Of the young gentlemen who write in the 'E.R.', I have now named the alpha and omega, the first and the last, the best and the worst. The intermediate members are designated with due honour hereafter.""]

""This was not just. Neither the heart nor the head of these gentlemen are at all what they are here represented. At the time this was written, I was personally unacquainted with either.""—B., 1816.

[Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850) founded the 'Edinburgh Review' in conjunction with Sydney Smith, Brougham, and Francis Horner, in 1802. In 1803 he succeeded Smith as editor, and conducted the 'Review' till 1829. Independence of publishers and high pay to contributors (""Ten guineas a sheet,"" writes Southey to Scott, June, 1807, ""instead of seven pounds for the 'Annual',"" 'Life and Corr'., iii. 125) distinguished the new journal from the first. Jeffrey was called to the Scottish bar in 1794, and as an advocate was especially successful with juries. He was constantly employed, and won fame and fortune. In 1829 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, and the following year, when the Whigs came into office, he became Lord Advocate. He sat as M.P. twice for Malton (1830-1832), and, afterwards, for Edinburgh. In 1834 he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Sessions, when he took the title of Lord Jeffrey. Byron had attacked Jeffrey in British Bards before his 'Hours of Idleness' had been cut up by the 'Edinburgh', and when the article appeared (Jan. 1808), under the mistaken impression that he was the author, denounced him at large (ll. 460-528) in the first edition of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'. None the less, the great critic did not fail to do ample justice to the poet's mature work, and won from him repeated acknowledgments of his kindness and generosity. (See 'Edinburgh Review', vol. xxii. p. 416, and Byron's comment in his 'Diary' for March 20,1814; 'Life', p. 232. See, too, 'Hints from Horace', ll. 589-626; and 'Don Juan', canto x. st. 11-16, and canto xii. st. 16. See also Bagehot's 'Literary Studies', vol. i. article I.)]

[Footnote 13: William Gifford (1756-1826), a self-taught scholar, first a ploughboy, then boy on board a Brixham coaster, afterwards shoemaker's apprentice, was sent by friends to Exeter College, Oxford (1779-81). In the 'Baviad' (1794) and the 'Maeviad' (1795) he attacked many of the smaller writers of the day, who were either silly, like the Della Cruscan School, or discreditable, like Williams, who wrote as ""Anthony Pasquin."" In his 'Epistle to Peter Pindar' (1800) he laboured to expose the true character of John Wolcot. As editor of the 'Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner' (November, 1797, to July, 1798), he supported the political views of Canning and his friends. As editor of the 'Quarterly Review', from its foundation (February, 1809) to his resignation in September, 1824, he soon rose to literary eminence by his sound sense and adherence to the best models, though his judgments were sometimes narrow-minded and warped by political prejudice. His editions of 'Massinger' (1805), which superseded that of Monck Mason and Davies (1765), of 'Ben Jonson' (1816), of 'Ford' (1827), are valuable. To his translation of 'Juvenal' (1802) is prefixed his autobiography. His translation of 'Persius' appeared in 1821. To Gifford, Byron usually paid the utmost deference. ""Any suggestion of yours, even if it were conveyed,"" he writes to him, in 1813, ""in the less tender text of the 'Baviad', or a Monck Mason note to Massinger, would be obeyed."" See also his letter (September 20, 1821, 'Life', p.531): ""I know no praise which would compensate me in my own mind for his censure."" Byron was attracted to Gifford, partly by his devotion to the classical models of literature, partly by the outspoken frankness of his literary criticism, partly also, perhaps, by his physical deformity.]

[Footnote 14: Henry James Pye (1745-1813), M.P. for Berkshire, and afterwards Police Magistrate for Westminster, held the office of poet laureate from 1790 till his death in 1813, succeeding Thomas Warton, and succeeded by Southey. He published 'Farringdon Hill' in 1774, The 'Progress of Refinement' in 1783, and a translation of Burger's 'Lenore' in 1795. His name recurs in the 'Vision of Judgment', stanza xcii. Lines 97-102 were inserted in the Fifth Edition.]

[Footnote 15: The first edition of the Satire opened with this line; and Byron's original intention was to prefix the following argument, first published in 'Recollections', by R. C. Dallas (1824):—

""ARGUMENT.

""The poet considereth times past, and their poesy—makes a sudden transition to times present—is incensed against book-makers—revileth Walter Scott for cupidity and ballad-mongering, with notable remarks on Master Southey—complaineth that Master Southey had inflicted three poems, epic and otherwise, on the public—inveigheth against William Wordsworth, but laudeth Mister Coleridge and his elegy on a young ass—is disposed to vituperate Mr. Lewis—and greatly rebuketh Thomas Little (the late) and Lord Strangford—recommendeth Mr. Hayley to turn his attention to prose—and exhorteth the Moravians to glorify Mr. Grahame—sympathiseth with the Rev. [William Bowles]—and deploreth the melancholy fate of James Montgomery—breaketh out into invective against the Edinburgh Reviewers—calleth them hard names, harpies and the like—apostrophiseth Jeffrey, and prophesieth.—Episode of Jeffrey and Moore, their jeopardy and deliverance; portents on the morn of the combat; the Tweed, Tolbooth, Firth of Forth [and Arthur's Seat], severally shocked; descent of a goddess to save Jeffrey; incorporation of the bullets with his sinciput and occiput.—Edinburgh Reviews 'en masse'.—Lord Aberdeen, Herbert, Scott, Hallam, Pillans, Lambe, Sydney Smith, Brougham, etc.—Lord Holland applauded for dinners and translations.—The Drama; Skeffington, Hook, Reynolds, Kenney, Cherry, etc.—Sheridan, Colman, and Cumberland called upon [requested, MS.] to write.—Return to poesy—scribblers of all sorts—lords sometimes rhyme; much better not—Hafiz, Rosa Matilda, and X.Y.Z.—Rogers, Campbell, Gifford, etc. true poets—Translators of the Greek Anthology—Crabbe—Darwin's style—Cambridge—Seatonian Prize—Smythe—Hodgson—Oxford—Richards—Poetaloquitur—Conclusion.""]

[Footnote 16: Lines 115, 116, were a MS. addition to the printed text of 'British Bards'. An alternative version has been pencilled on the margin:—

""Otway and Congreve mimic scenes had wove
And Waller tuned his Lyre to mighty Love.""]
[Footnote 17: Thomas Little was the name under which Moore's early poems were published, 'The Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little, Esq.' (1801). ""Twelves"" refers to the ""duodecimo."" Sheets, after printing, are pressed between cold or hot rollers, to impart smoothness of ""surface."" Hot rolling is the more expensive process.]

[Footnote 18: Eccles. chapter i. verse 9.]

[Footnote 19: At first sight Byron appears to refer to the lighting of streets by gas, especially as the first shop lighted with it was that of Lardner & Co., at the corner of the Albany (June, 1805), and as lamps were on view at the premises of the Gas Light and Coke Company in Pall Mall from 1808 onwards. But it is almost certain that he alludes to the ""sublimating gas"" of Dr. Beddoes, which his assistant, Davy, mentions in his 'Researches' (1800) as nitrous oxide, and which was used by Southey and Coleridge. The same four ""wonders"" of medical science are depicted in Gillray's caricatures, November, 1801, and May and June, 1802, and are satirized in Christopher Caustic's 'Terrible Tractoration! A Poetical Petition against Galvanising Trumpery and the Perkinistit Institution' (in 4 cantos, 1803).

Against vaccination, or cow-pox, a brisk war was still being carried on.
Gillray has a likeness of Jenner vaccinating patients.
Metallic ""Tractors"" were a remedy much advertised at the beginning of the century by an American quack, Benjamin Charles Perkins, founder of the Perkinean Institution in London, as a ""cure for all Disorders, Red Noses, Gouty Toes, Windy Bowels, Broken Legs, Hump Backs.""

In Galvanism several experiments, conducted by Professor Aldini, nephew of Galvani, are described in the 'Morning Post' for Jan. 6th, Feb. 6th, and Jan. 22nd, 1803. The latter were made on the body of Forster the murderer.

For the allusion to Gas, compare 'Terrible Tractoration', canto 1—

""Beddoes (bless the good doctor) has
Sent me a bag full of his gas,
Which snuff'd the nose up, makes wit brighter,
And eke a dunce an airy writer.""]
[Footnote 20: Stott, better known in the 'Morning Post' by the name of
Hafiz. This personage is at present the most profound explorer of the
bathos. I remember, when the reigning family left Portugal, a special
Ode of Master Stott's, beginning thus:—('Stott loquitur quoad
Hibernia')—
""Princely offspring of Braganza,
Erin greets thee with a stanza,"" etc.
Also a Sonnet to Rats, well worthy of the subject, and a most thundering
Ode, commencing as follows:—
""Oh! for a Lay! loud as the surge
That lashes Lapland's sounding shore.""
Lord have mercy on us! the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel"" was nothing to this. [The lines ""Princely Offspring,"" headed ""Extemporaneous Verse on the expulsion of the Prince Regent from Portugal by Gallic Tyranny,"" were published in the 'Morning Post', Dec. 30, 1807. (See 'post', l. 708, and 'note'.)] ]

[Footnote 21: See p. 317, note 1.]

[Footnote 22: See the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" 'passim'. Never was any plan so incongruous and absurd as the groundwork of this production. The entrance of Thunder and Lightning prologuising to Bayes' tragedy [('vide The Rehearsal'), 'British Bards'], unfortunately takes away the merit of originality from the dialogue between Messieurs the Spirits of Flood and Fell in the first canto. Then we have the amiable William of Deloraine, ""a stark moss-trooper,"" videlicet, a happy compound of poacher, sheep-stealer, and highwayman. The propriety of his magical lady's injunction not to read can only be equalled by his candid acknowledgment of his independence of the trammels of spelling, although, to use his own elegant phrase, ""'twas his neckverse at Harribee,"" 'i. e.' the gallows.

The biography of Gilpin Horner, and the marvellous pedestrian page, who travelled twice as fast as his master's horse, without the aid of seven-leagued boots, are 'chefs d'oeuvre' in the improvement of taste. For incident we have the invisible, but by no means sparing box on the ear bestowed on the page, and the entrance of a Knight and Charger into the castle, under the very natural disguise of a wain of hay. Marmion, the hero of the latter romance, is exactly what William of Deloraine would have been, had he been able to read and write. The poem was manufactured for Messrs. CONSTABLE, MURRAY, and MILLER, worshipful Booksellers, in consideration of the receipt of a sum of money; and truly, considering the inspiration, it is a very creditable production. If Mr. SCOTT will write for hire, let him do his best for his paymasters, but not disgrace his genius, which is undoubtedly great, by a repetition of Black-Letter Ballad imitations.

[Constable paid Scott a thousand pounds for 'Marmion', and

""offered one fourth of the copyright to Mr. Miller of Albemarle
Street, and one fourth to Mr. Murray of Fleet Street (see line 173).
Both publishers eagerly accepted the proposal.""
…
""A severe and unjust review of 'Marmion' by Jeffrey appeared in [the
'Edinburgh Review' for April] 1808, accusing Scott of a mercenary
spirit in writing for money. … Scott was much nettled by these
observations.""
('Memoirs of John Murray', i. 76, 95). In his diary of 1813 Byron wrote of Scott,

""He is undoubtedly the Monarch of Parnassus, and the most 'English' of
Bards.""
'Life', p. 206.]]

[Footnote 23: It was the suggestion of the Countess of Dalkeith, that
Scott should write a ballad on the old border legend of 'Gilpin Horner',
which first gave shape to the poet's ideas, and led to the 'Lay of the
Last Minstrel'.]
[Footnote 24: In his strictures on Scott and Southey, Byron takes his lead from Lady Anne Hamilton's (1766-1846, daughter of Archibald, ninth Duke of Hamilton, and Lady-in-waiting to Caroline of Brunswick) 'Epics of the Ton' (1807), a work which has not shared the dubious celebrity of her 'Secret Memories of the Court', etc. (1832). Compare the following lines (p. 9):—

""Then still might Southey sing his crazy Joan,
Or feign a Welshman o'er the Atlantic flown,
Or tell of Thalaba the wondrous matter,
Or with clown Wordsworth, chatter, chatter, chatter.
* * * * *
Good-natured Scott rehearse, in well-paid lays,
The marv'lous chiefs and elves of other days.""
(For Scott's reference to ""my share of flagellation among my betters,"" and an explicit statement that he had remonstrated with Jeffrey against the ""offensive criticism"" of 'Hours of Idleness', because he thought it treated with undue severity, see Introduction to 'Marmion', 1830.)]]

[Footnote 25: Lines 179, 180, in the Fifth Edition, were substituted for variant i. p. 312.—'Leigh Hunt's annotated Copy of the Fourth Edition'.]

[Footnote 26: ""Good night to Marmion""—the pathetic and also prophetic exclamation of Henry Blount, Esquire, on the death of honest Marmion.]

[Footnote 27: As the 'Odyssey' is so closely connected with the story of the 'Iliad', they may almost be classed as one grand historical poem. In alluding to Milton and Tasso, we consider the 'Paradise Lost' and 'Gerusalemme Liberata' as their standard efforts; since neither the 'Jerusalem Conquered' of the Italian, nor the 'Paradise Regained' of the English bard, obtained a proportionate celebrity to their former poems. Query: Which of Mr. Southey's will survive?]

[Footnote 28: 'Thalaba', Mr. Southey's second poem, is written in defiance of precedent and poetry. Mr. S. wished to produce something novel, and succeeded to a miracle. 'Joan of Arc' was marvellous enough, but 'Thalaba' was one of those poems ""which,"" in the word of PORSON, ""will be read when Homer and Virgil are forgotten, but—.]]",Lord Byron,1995,"[90, 82, 92]",3

90,East Side Rendezvous,"[Verse 1: Frost]
I just woke up, thank God it's Friday
Fire up the lac and hit the highway
Pulled in the car wash, so we can hit them whitewall tires
Sedan DeVille sitting on L.A. Wires
And it's got to be 80 degrees
I got a check in my pocket for fifteen G's
Hit the first interstate, now I'm straight
Stop at the record store to pick me up an old school tape
Back in my ride, see the spin of the tires
Kid Frost rolling, bumping Earth, Wind, & Fire
It feels good holding fifteen grand
So I parked the Sedan and I strolled into Greenspans
Give me a pair of your 50-30s
Cascades, Cortez and a jet-black hoodie
Headed back home and got G'd-up, fool
It's an eastside rendezvous, yeah yeah

[Hook: Diane Gordon]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 2: O.G. Enius]
Now, who be that brand new daddy of the year
I swear; baby, we gonna take you there
It's me, that eastside G y'all never heard of
With A.L.T. and them folks getting much love
Through the neighborhoods, through the city
Woofers in the back bumping 'do-wah-ditty', yeah
Drop a line to them hookers for their info
Pack them smokes, LA capping with their khacks low
Cause we some true players, bandits
Got them hynas at the hotel and they can't stand it
I got that sexual healing on them
36-double-deuce-36 and I'm feeling on them
Ooh-eee, I see, she got it going on like a true Miss G
But I'm a stay true P-I-M-P from the eastside

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 3: A.L.T.]
Now it's Friday night and everything's alright
So just sit back, relax and enjoy the flight
It's A.L.T. hitting corners in the 63
And I'm straight rendezvous-in' through the SGV
As the 18's blast, pop the tape in the dash
Bumping old school fools like Teddy Pendergrass
I can feel the heat coming out from underneath my seat
I never heard the word 'defeat'
It's the middle of July, so it's hot
I think of Kid Frost, he's recording at the G Spot, fool
Frost said, ""I hope the one time don't stop ya""
I don't give a damn, I'm sipping Malibu and Vodka
I'm on that San Bernardino
In the fast lane cause baby got some hynas out in Chino
And you know that I'm a G'd up fool
It's an eastside rendezvous and I'm there

Gotta grind, gotta get mine
In the hood that I claim and I slang on that double 9-9
Gotta find them dubs
Gonna get a 40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner: St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap pap
From the 1st to the 15th
Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad, count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block
Spend a couple of bills, thugs smoke a lot of weed on the 1st

Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone

Sure, put me down!
I'ma hop on the bus with Biz (yo brother, let's get drunk!)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of the skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the 1st come around
Now I be freakin' me Black n Mild
Headed cross town cause niggas, the 1st get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st, just call me that pro slang

The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease

“I had a bad dream”
“Don’t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams”
“What a time you chose to be born in”

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year’s
And all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight
Fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made ‘em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmers
And it’s bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don’t suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae
Increase the murder rate
Similar to hitmen who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo; no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o’clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
Three-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours
Bought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
‘Cause niggas’ main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet-black Galant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
‘Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I’m not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

[Bridge: Life]
You know, you had me
With your sensuous charm
But you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down

Cross that bridge you catching brooklyn kid
Move left, hear harlem, get shook
Call your next kin
Running your mouth, lacking bearing and discipline
These tards not up to par to spar underguard
I just farted it smells like his underarms
Got his hands up, like he's in class
Kissing the teachers ass
Straight A's, teachers pet
Put that apple on the teachers desk
This right here, just a test of them
Ignorant on them, I meant new Testament
Words of wisdom, visions heaven sent
It's evident, your not innocent
Just hellbent, instead
We poppin off on them, over internet
That's a bet, caught interest
Shit you spit, we not impressed
Fresh to death, blessed to see the days i'm lent
Leap frog over you wannabe MC's and hip hoppers
Shits bonkers, all of you
Just ass kissing cock bobbers
Learn to speak proper, come off your high horse
Your not a monster
Imitating adopted ass is foster
No king, there's only the don, kiss the ring
180, i'm captain kirk
Your just a ka-ka-ka-ka- klingon
Sending you deep space, no trace, be gone
Bitches screaming yo R3kLuSE, where the fuck you from?
What it matter? how about where im at
Outside waiting, with a loaded gat
Meant tic tac, toe
This shit for fun, laugh at you scum
Cruel and hazardous
All your raps sound blasphemous
Your trashin us is wack, stay back
Your done
I'm a visionary, give you spit like pictionary
Not gonna dumb it down, get a dictionary
Couldn't make it clearer with some windex
Streak free clean, your bars so obsolete
Bitches say freeze, I hit control, alt, delete
Get you stupid, the riddler's toy, mind depletes
Arnold schwarzenegger, so cold
Batman, he's the king of gotham
Fucking governor of auto tuned mc's
Get you a twelve step, quit smoking bad tree's
Get a snow ski, try gliding
Quit hiding, behind the scenes
Fake ass rappers attempting to connect the dots
Think its hot
It dropped
Its not
The feds is listening, the bitches is whistling
Your bitch got my dick deepthroat
About to blow up, like watergate
[as the bed shakes]
Crooked as nixon
See me leaning on that impeachment
Resign to find, dirty ignorance is bliss
Fulfill my duties as a man
Strong offense unstoppable defense
Repent your sins, as confessions descend
Listen to them, fuel up on dividends
Multiply empty times
Get only dark skies
Steady cons and lies, motivation drives
Too late only God designs
He uncovers the despise, the reprise and wolf cries
Equals bitter demise
It's haters and perpetrators
Brain washing poor victims with tv
Oscar nominating acting
You left contracting
Hells evil disease, the weak believed
And strong were deceived
Reasons need a reminder, we on the same team
You ain't running shit
But an irregular bowel movement
Diarrhea when you see us
Laxatives running through them
Clean the hater's out like drano
You clogged up? you choke everyday though
Post it note, new reminder
Add R3kLuSE, you get the spider
Eat you up everyday cause i'm a surviver
Get in this mess, you gonna get the address
Like the president at the podium
I'm spitting, you listening
Catching arachnophobia
When you asleep, i'm walking over ya
You feel me, got reinforcements in your ceiling
Now this the end, like lamborghini
I'm peeling
Now it's heard 24/7, the news is reeling
Remix, dj stuck, fa-fa-fa-fa- fucking repeating
R3kLuSE is out, and over your beating
Shout out to my brother Marines

If you saw me in the daylight you would probably jump
But currently, blurrily, I can see you're on my junk
And that's straight because I can tell you're out my league
You told me that you were a teacher, girl, I'm an emcee
Still living at my parents', age twenty-three
But you like me cause you heard me rock on many beats
But anyway, I hope you're down with me at daylight
I'm making omelettes and shit, you're gonna stay, right?
I mean it's cool for you to stay nights
But in the morning hope you see me in the same light
And don't freak like Gremlins

Rocking my t-shirt from high school that says Wells Soccer
Other than that you're pretty nekkid

Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved

Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit

I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates

106,"Feel The Funk (From ""Dangerous Minds"")","Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:

*show ODB with hair*

You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:

""Fantastic Voyage""

Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood

Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside

Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it

A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by

And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned

*video starts*

You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:

""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone

Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke

Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise

You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down

Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street

And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…

So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams

And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success

Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:

They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…

Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...",Rap Critic,1995,"[97, 80, 75, 64, 55, 58, 47, 46, 46, 46, 52, 56, 63]",13

109,Liquid Swords,"[Skit: Gibran Evans]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in the front want it

Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels

I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah
I know what she like, I know what she want

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
My bitch just like me so I know she wan' stunt
A taste of the good life, yeah, I know what she want
A trip to PR, sex in the car, floating diamonds shabar (woo!)
Call us hood, it's all good, that's what we are (YEAH!)
Find an exotic space to visit, chinchilla, gator-lizid
That's how a nigga gets it when I'm on my shizzit
Bright lights, city life, a nigga so flashy
Have you like ""Damn! That Ferrari flew past me!""
So fast a nigga don't know limits
Had a bad bitch in it, I can see it wasn't tinted
Get the money then spend it (yeah), break rules or bend it (yeah)
To my liking, I move like a viking (AOWW!)
A warrior, I shouldn't mean more to you
I'm the American dream, one man regime (uh huh)
Shorty love me like she love new shoes
Insecure, so she investigate me like the Feds, ooh

[Chorus: Intro sample (50 Cent)]
Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)
It goes on and on and on (it's funny, it's funny), we just can't go wrong (it's funny, it's funny)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
They can smile, they can frown, they can love it, they can hate it
They can wish bad shit on us, it's cool, we made it
Look at me to see the Lord's blessings while they stressing
Switch whips, push the Bugatti through the recession (woo!)
It's just me and you, I can see it clear
Police coming, I need you to stash this pistol here
It's all hood, you hesitate they'll put our life on pause (uh huh)
It's a common wealth state, baby, they make up laws
Fuck CMB, it's you and me, baby, we all we got
I say we gon' make it, they saying we not (uh huh)
Yeah, but they don't know I'm meant for you, they don't know how you're into me
They don't know shit about how we bond mentally (AOWW!)
Their relationships are oh so basic
They can't understand how we do and how we say shit
So blunt, don't front, I got you open
It's the original G shit, you know how we get, duck down!

[Chorus: Intro sample (50 Cent)]
Funny how time flies (it's funny how time flies) when you're making love (it's funny, it's funny)

113,Last Dayz,"[Produced by Fredro Starr]

[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
South suicide Queens, all niggas
Gather up all your arms
And get ready for this New World Order
Shit is about to change, motherfucker!

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
I’m America’s nightmare
Young, black and just don’t give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
So fuck a 9-to-5! And whitey tryin' to slave us
With minimum wages, slammin' my niggas up in cages
Changin their behavior to spittin' razors, that's outrageous
Smokin' roaches is hopeless
We want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffeurs who fuck us, full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush, it's that Afficial Nast
Got bitches with pistols and cash, we livin' in the last
My theory is ""fuck it,"" sexy niggas get abducted
My corrupted is conducted, through ghettos, sippin' Amaretto
Hand on the metal, foot on the pedal, never settle
He wore Carolina Herrera, dirty Donna Karan sweaters
Ralph Lauren leathers and suedes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up; I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners, bustin' shots at Time-Warner's

[Verse 2: Sonee Seeza]
My man big Ty, he know how to get by
Get high, do a jix, then be fixed to be fly
Some mid, cross and up and downtown action
And when he stick he keep a grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibis, a plan to stay wise
And wide-eyed, livin' in the state of Southside
Crooked jakes and fakes, snake niggas all out for papes
All who wanna overtake, you leave them with drapes
The white sheet covers, this heat smothers
The street, eat brothers, six shots rang, duke got banged
We all ready for these wars
We all want more, these the last days—get yours!

[Bridge 1: Fredro Starr]
32 shots inserted in Glock's, you heard it for blocks
The murderer who gots convertible drops
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
‘Cause it be off the hook, crooks, crack
Cheeba spots, and sellin' rocks
The cops around the clock, it’s hot
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Thinkin' about takin' my own life, I might as well
Except they might not sell weed in hell
And that’s where I’m goin', ‘cause the Devil’s inside of me
He make me rob from my own nationality
That’s kind of ignorant, but yo, I gotta pay the rent
So, yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite
A degenerate, if I get caught I'm innocent
‘Cause I don't leave no sticky fingerprints
For the cops, they only good if they dead
And all that badge and the gun shit be goin’ to their head
To make bread I gotta steal for sport
So I stole the show and made some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fuckin' rap shit don't pay
I'ma start sellin' drugs around my way
Killin' my own people in the USG
Shit, they gonna get it from somebody, I'd rather it be me
Besides, you can't tax dirty money
And you can't trust nobody (Nobody!)
No one (No one!), I'm a scorpion
And I'll probably bite the bullet, ‘cause I live by the gun

[Bridge 2: Fredro Starr]
Big heavy-hitters, 25-to-life bidders who just came out
And pullin' flame out, take aim, blow your brains out
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
In South suicide Queens where niggas act up
Nigga, back up, Afficial Nast, throw your fuckin' gats up!
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
We never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
Afficial Nast motherfuckers don't give a shit—word up!",Onyx,1995,"[100, 89, 90, 90, 93]",5

115,'Til You Do Me Right,"[Verse 1]
I was in love with you
I gave my heart to you
I did my best to keep you satisfied
You took the love from me
And used it selfishly
You did not give back your love to me at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I gave the sun to you
You said it was too bright
I gave you diamond rings
You said they didn't shine
I gave my world to you
You said it's not enough
What in the world could I have done to make you be so rough

[Chorus]
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
And 'til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

[Verse 2]
Girl I was there for you
Someone you could talk to
How could you just keep breaking my heart?
What did I do to you
To make you be so cruel?
I don't understand why you've been so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I tried to be your strength
You said I was too strong
I tried to compromise
So we could get along
I gave my love to you
Despite your evil ways
I guess it's clear to me, there's only one thing left to say

[Chorus]
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your evil ways

[Bridge]
There's a time when you know what you feel inside your heart
It's telling you that something is strange
Ooh girl, you don't have to deny it
All you got to do is just try it
You'll find our love is stronger if you're willing to change

[Chorus]
'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways

'Til you do me right
I don't even want to talk to you
I don't even wanna hear you speak my name
'Til you do me right
Only wrong is gonna come to you
Nothing good is gonna come to you 'til your change your ways
Until you change your ways

I want the money, whoever shall disagree can suck it
It ain't a secret so peep it, I'm tryin' to Scrooge Mcduck it
Eatin' off thousand dollar shit that I did right
I get the cream but can't remember eating at midnight
It's just as well, must've puffed a nail with a gremlin
Then again, can't pretend that I'm not a sinner with synonyms
They don't put us on pedestals high as Tech, Eminem, and 'em
Look at me being Christian, I listen then I'm forgivin' 'em
Don't get it twisted you bitches, listen for disses closely
Spit in the face of a monkey tryin' to diss an OG
You wiggin' out, you get ya whole damn hood sprayed up
I'm off my rocker like an old man stood straight up
Been executed, rebooted, gotta be rare
Still might post up in a pic with a chick, I gotta be fair
Swear my bottom dollar is bloody buddy beware
If they dolin' out the duckets, well fuck it, Imma be there

Pray or be prayed upon, I'm shinin' when they throw the shade on
I'm sorry I'm late, leavin' early, I never stay long
When I'm on my James Bond, all y'all kiddies can play with crayons, ah
City liaison laced me with a key, she hold connection
V.I.P special guest and for me and my soul collective
The S.O.P, I keep my letters signed with 'Os' and 'Xs'
Owner let me close the section, sex is a loaded weapon
Sippin' Amarone or Brunello from the Monticello
Slanted eye observe through the decanter, I'm the calmest fellow
Accompanied by something dangerous walkin' on stilettos
Talkin' over contracts in the back, the dough was all but settled
On my level, fire flower resembled emerald city
Sweaty hippies hold me down, know my nose is rose pedal picky
Love me, she love me not, we translucent to opaque
Gave the bouquet the O.K and relocated to home base
Where the MO is at

So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, ""Too soon!
Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject? You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart Three Stacks, keep your heart
Hey, keep your heart Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part""

My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Baby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
'Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't
""Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it
Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets
Had to tie her to a rocket""
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump

Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up

Verse One:

The E gets wicked, no need for the biscuit
The green-eyed funkdafied brother coming wicked
I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, cuz I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots (daaat's right)
I'm dynamite with this mic
I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
To your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin

Chorus:

Brothers can't see me                                \

Verse Two:

It goes one for the trouble, two for the show
Aiyyo, I'm gettin airplay like The Most Beautiful
I'm the mack, I made Goldy turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone (yeah)
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
To specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-R-I-C-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, ""I should've said that""

Chorus

Verse Three:

Complete this puzzle, what Squad be Def like Russell Simmons
And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape

And y'all constantly keep listening
Yeah, who can it be now, watch out

[Verse One: WC]
Nigga clear the lane, here I come, once again
With this, gangsta click, droppin this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggas that's sittin on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattoed on my chest
Walkin with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggas is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin it up, so motherfucker West Up!

[Verse Two: Mack 10]
It's gun ho Mack one-0 please you can't fuck wit deez

And hip-hop, top three niggas the new bosses
Never slippin cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought You Knew How We Do It
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always On Them Thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers, hoochie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest boulders on the block for sale
Inglewood City, the throne I call home
Niggas be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bell through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Ice Cube]
Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades in my mouth, just a Glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggas got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: WC]
Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggas are puttin it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggas caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
[Mack 10] So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide

123,I Got 5 On It,"[Intro: Michael Marshall]
Creep on in, on in, on in (Whoa)
See I'm ridin' high (Whoa)
Kinda broke this evening, y'all, so all I got's five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty and when it comes to
Getting another stogie, fools all kick in like
Shinobi. No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be poppin' to let my friend hit it
Bit unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee, the serious
Bomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it (got it, good), grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it, messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it (got it, good), it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it, partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I take sacks to the
Face whenever I can, don't need no crutch
I'm so keyed up till the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa to burn
Slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the
Joint, stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a
Fatty, but the Tanqueray straight had me

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull]
Ayy, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
I been smoked
Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down up in the O-A-K
The Town, homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

[Chorus: Michael Marshall]
I got five on it; grab your four, let's get keyed

124,"Colors Of The Wind (From ""Pocahontas"")","You think you own whatever land you land on
The earth is just a dead thing you can claim
But I know every rock and tree and creature
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name

You think the only people who are people
Are the people who look and think like you
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned?
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?

Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest
Come taste the sun-sweet berries of the earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you
And for once, never wonder what they're worth
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers
The heron and the otter are my friends
And we are all connected to each other
In a circle, in a hoop that never ends

Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
Or let the eagle tell you where he's been
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain?
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

How high does the sycamore grow?
If you cut it down, then you'll never know

And you'll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon
For whether we are white or copper-skinned
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind

All you'll own is earth until
You can paint with all the colors of the wind",Tori Kelly,1995,"[50, 46, 34, 31, 27, 22, 36, 21, 15, 11, 10, 7, 7, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 24, 25, 42, 55]",23

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times I window watch out the Mariott
Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop top coupes, and yachts
Guzzling straight shots of scotch
Formulating up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot
Cause it's scorching hot
Making it hard trying to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki, got all kinds of undercovers coming at me
Perhaps he, won't be happy, 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be, sitting in Coxsackie
But never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstasy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make living this a must, plus, it's real...

No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta' treat ya'
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Caribbean cuisine
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store to see my dreams

So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master
Ain't much more life to fiend after, but another chapter
A new way of life to adapt to, 'cause these streets'll gas ya'
And have ya' caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killer crew more hospitable
Consciously aware plus political (political..)
'Cause though they claim that every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established, we eating lovely, living lavish

And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

Fallen angels with clipped wings shooting
Down my dreams hoping I never make it to
Hotels suite as cream lord please
Forgive me for my vices Im never ok
With second Joe why you Biden pockets
Money hungry on a strict diet from
A city where niggas only appliance
Is a stove on they waist souls wasted
Like a whino on the pavement they
Say stop the violence when they just contain it
My soul rich and my heart is made of gold, no amount
Of currency could make me sell my soul I am legend
On this map quest leaving land marks on the game naw
I ain't pissed Im just hella stressed like this denim im
Not true to religion cuz I seen to many parish in parishes
And to 5 0 1 nigga dead is a blessing, question, why we outkast in our gene
Pool hip hop's savior you should put me on a pedestal
Now watch this black boy fly I got my jays laced
Ask whitney we the only dope allowed in her face
Kindle a flame let yo brain levitate this is higher learning
In sermons im moses parting waves

Definition of some dreamers
Ls not far fetched that im a schemer
Tryna come up not the hardest in this city
But its harder when you tryna keep it clean not gritty
Working 9 – 5s just to buy supplies for this rap shit
Beats studio time a couple pens and pad shit
Tryna get yo flow together why you work the floor
Dreams of bigger venues no more open mics show
Getting dough for that flow that you just rocked the crowd with
Hands waving side to side im grinning feeling childish
Sound of my alarm still keeps a fly kid grounded
The bright lights golOt me blinded
It’s a reminder to not get to big for my britches
And if I fall in love pick a queen not these bitches
And now they say im an emcee on a mission
Can't wait for the day I see things that I pictured

[Verse 3: Carrera Kool]

First off gotta shout out to the lord and my granny
Cuz they the only ones that understand me
Moving right along bruce lee playing ping pong
With nunchucks will catch my attention but for you dumb fucks
Dancing round with shirts off guns out blunts lit all
Because you think its kool boy thats some dumb shit
A whole lot of nothing multiplied by some stuntin
Will equal a bunch of fronting on how you gon get something
As I paralyze the hooks and slit the throat of verses
Cattle prod the beats while producers will drive the hearses
I just wanna be useful and not viewed is worthless
Make sure my fam ain't gotta struggle while making a purchase
Grew up with a half mom and no dad
Living in the chi you gotta grow yo on gonads
So I learnt the ropes perhaps stay away from snakes and rats
Cuz they always bring pigs hit harder than lance briggs
So next time you selling arm and hammer while being armed with hammer
You know how not to get up in the slammer
You'll never double cross us like the legs on a indian
So switch it up like aunt vivian

He might be doing you
But he's thinking about me
So baby, think about another lover
And go find another brother
I know he's my man
He's all in my hands
It feels good when he calls my name
Don't you wish you had the same?
Feeling disgust working your stuff
Until he thinks about mine
Now he's feeling real high
You ask why 'cause he's mine

Tell you something
That just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you
I wouldn't waste my time
Telling something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

He's mine
You may have had him once
But I got him all the time
(You can't sleep at night)
He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time

He's mine
You may of had him once
But I got him all the time
(I got him all the time)

[Verse 2:]
Went out on a date
Wasn't out too late
Took you to a room
And you gave it up too soon
Played you like a trick
'Cuz you let him hit
Now he's coming home to a lover
That is strong

I got all his love, baby, don't try to take it
You wanted a piece, you were mistaken
'Cuz he belongs to me
Baby, can't you see?
I tell you something that just ain't cool
Never fall in love with a man
Who don't love you

I wouldn't waste my time
Telling you something wrong
You've been with him one night
And now he's coming home

We don't have time
Playing these games
You had him once
But it's me on his mind
No need to cry
Go dry your eyes

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
From a P in the pot
Type of nigga, used to sleep on a cot
Type of nigga, used to get it and go
You the type that sold a ki to a cop
Type of nigga, have your bitch in my spot
I'm the type to tie her feet in a knot
Type of nigga, turned a dream to a G
Type of nigga, turned that G to a drop
Turn around and take a P on the lot
Used to say, ""Give me codeine on the rocks""
Used to say, ""Kiss it one time"" cause that coochie was stankin'
I sprayed some Febreze on the box, weed in my socks
Picture of me with a block on the block
Picture me rollin'
If I get gunned down today
Your picture they gon' be holdin'
Pick up the paper, custodian
Your bitch about to get stolen, now it is a wrap
Talkin' aluminum foil
Tat-tat-tat-tat, what the fuck? Shoot a nigga playin' tunk
Show me a bitch that is loyal
I could sell her desert soil
Love me or love me not
You cannot go to my mama's spot

I'm the type to put the ki on the block
I'm the type to be the king of the spot
Push button, ain't no key for the drop
Tatted my body, I think that I'm Pac
Got these bitches fallin' through to give me the box
Bet you niggas wonder how I did it
Fell in love with sellin' drugs and then I went and got a plug
And I made a little bit of money, spendin' hundred thousand limits
I had to give these hoes
I had to give these hoes someone to love
Took them 5s and 10s and 20s, added it up
Took them 50s, 100s, then I went to the club
They can see what I'm doin'
See what I'm doin', it's easier than drugs
In the kitchen water whippin', flippin' pigeons
Double the digits, the blue money come
Got the Forgiatto on that new Gallardo
Blowin' avocado, ridin' through Chicago
Got the double cup and lean in baby bottle
Got the shooters with me, black Mercedes follow
Shoe cost a bando
Rest in peace Nando
My bitch came from Cuba, the weed from Cali
But my plug Mexicano

I'm comin' back to the teacher now
We're not the same, I'm a creature now
Came a long way from them Regals now
How he hop out of two seaters now?
That's what them bitches be sayin'
That's what them niggas be sayin'
But hate is an ugly trait
You want somethin' salty go shit in your hand
Shout out to Cap and his bitch
He got me whippin' my wrist in a Glad
Look like I'm whippin' my wrist in a Glad
All yellow Rollie, is piss on my hand
I never listen to man
God told me ""give 'em the truth"", I've just been spittin' the truth
That shit you're spittin' ain't true
I'm just a product, can prove
I'm somethin' ill in the booth
I'm known to kill in the booth, I'm known to spill in the booth
See I keep it better, I'll never talk to a pillar
And I cannot talk to these niggas, so

Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sitting on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping it, checking a smile
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's wit' it
I get the 5 to the 6-7 digits
Call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
Cuz Monty ain't here for nothing but I gotta let all

Summertime, no funner time for me to kick in with you
To find some things I wanna get into
I call up my crew I tell them bring a brew
And some Hennessey for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny she likes to shoop
With Montell and the SL Coup
While the beat is bumpin' from South Central to Compton

132,MC's Act Like They Don't Know,"[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
'Cause I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Goin' out to the hardcore hip hop
Of course we don't flip flop

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

[Chorus]
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know
MCs act like they don't know

It's just one of them days when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days, don't take it personal

I wanna take some time out to think things through

And I find myself in misery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really want to be with you the whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back from mood to mood it's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love?
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me, boy

139,Let Her Cry,"[Verse 1]
She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind

[Verse 2]
She never lets me in
Only tell me where's she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

[Verse 3]
This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Saying...

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling, ""Oh mama, please help me""
Won't you hold my hand and...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

Let's don't wait till the water runs dry

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

141,One More Chance/Stay With Me,"[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
First things first: I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like ’cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, gon' see my guns—get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in—game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break, uhh

[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Baby, here I am
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All, I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
'Cause you, don't need nobody else
One more chance

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True playa for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke, tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, can you sing the song for me, boo?

[Chorus: Faith Evans & (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
One more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)

One more chance

One more chance

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion - flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President

So grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?
And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me, 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's hell, see, I never thought
I'd see the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—

[Chorus: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

[Outro: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you

Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
'Cause I'm a one of a kind and I can rock your mind
I could do it two times at one time
I'm a certified master of ceremony
'Cause I'm next in line to a [?] king money
What separates me from other MCs
I'm cool, calm, very confident
'Cause every word I said, just know I meant
'Cause it's a natural fact to try to counter-react
But I spank to the rhythm, gotta bring it right back
Got rhymes a lot, got rhymes galore
Young ladies never heard it like this before
Got dukes, earls, and fly girls
Lieutenants, captains, and admirals
Tryna figure out a way to take on the Tone
And no they just can't do it alone
I think I walk, talk kinda southern
Try to knock me off just to take a step forward
That's okay, I'm gonna settle the score
With the help of my crew called Family Four
Mike C, what you came to do?
I came to shout, turn out, and party too
K.C. ho, what you came to do?
I came to shout, turn out, and party too
B.J., what you came to do?
I came to bop, don't stop and party with you
Well Tony Tone, what you came to do?
Came to shout, turn out, and party too

[Verse 6: Family Four]
We're kings it would seem, of a disco scene
And when the party start you'll see what we mean
We can rock, impress, two minutes or less
And make the rest best and head due west
We're the Family disco and we're down by law
We're known throughout the world as the Family Four
We're cool, calm, and very versatile
And when we rock on the mic all the ladies smile
We're the Family Four and just like a bomb
We're ready to rock at any alarm
We can rock to a beat for any nationality
'Cause we do it with finesse and authority
Just give us a mic and a funky, funky beat
Make ya get up on the floor, make you do the freak
Because we're the group that's meant to be
The baddest MCs of the century
Well there's gonna come a day when I got to say
Tony Tone put away the MC play
Get with the books, that give a girl second looks
Find me a job, try to work real hard
Be a one-woman lover, give up all the others
Promise myself they'll not be another
But all the fly girls, you can still get some
'Cause I'm stickin' it out with number one
But you could do me a favor, try to still remember
I was born on the 16th day of September
Virgo, you rock the house
And Mike C, my mellow
What it look like when you're on the mic?

[Verse 7: Mike C]
'Cause I'm the king without a crown
All the talk of the town
And all the young ladies bite when I'm, too, gettin' down
'Cause when I'm on the microphone ya see I rock so good
I'm glad to be in the neighborhood
You just take your time and you will see
There's no one better on land or sea
Except K.C., hey rock the beat y'all
K.C., it's on you
So just show the people, show the people what ya wanna do

[Verse 8: Kid K.C.]
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
Keep on, keep on, I'ma sing my song
Rockin' on the mic with the Family Four
Make me feel real proud and a whole lot more
I'm tryna make it known in a helluva way
That the kid K.C. is here to stay
Let's uphill climb or downhill fall
Or tryna make yourself something when you're nothin' at all
So you take a wrong way on a 2-way street
But the road of success is at the end of the beat
Rappin' on the mic 'til the very end
Tryna push my way through thick and thin
I won't give up, I'm gonna press my luck, huh
Can't get enough of that MC stuff
B.J., my mellow
What it look like when you're on the mic?

[Verse 9: Kid Vicious B.J.]
To the beat y'all, and you don't stop
Keep on, to the break of dawn
When we first started out we had a obligation
To be the best crew in the nation
Now we're number one and that's no bull
'Cause we can rhyme on time, from ten until
Say we are the king when it comes to the mic
We can rock to a beat that makes you feel alright
You walk through the door, just work on a tease
So when you rock with the Four you get a guarantee
We're the Family Four and when we're rockin' on
The beat don't stop to the early dawn
'Cause we're the Four MC, rock viciously
'Cause you stop at the door and paid your money
To hear the best cut, to hear the best rhyme
To dance across the floor and have a good time
The Family Four, we're gonna turn it out
For all the fly girls that's in the house!

[Verse 10: Family Four]
This world a trip, we're gonna tell you why
It got wars, whores, and gangs galore
It got little old ladies born in 1904
It got crooks stealing and going to jail
It got 14 year old kids who can't get bail
It got 10 year old kids who be having guns
Just shootin' everybody and thinkin' it's fun
And I hope nobody wanna give us some
Because the Family Four, we don't want none
Don't play with guns, don't need no harm
Don't need no stick lady knockin' at my door
And even though my mama won't let 'em in
You say stuff like that we don't wanna begin
It make your family look bad, makes your mama sad
To get an old-fashioned whoopin' from your dad
You think the man is wrong, but the man is right
You say stuff like that makes your family uptight
You start arguin' with your sister, fightin' with your brother
I tried to tell your mother that Parkay butter
Then tellin' your pops that you're gonna leave home
'Cause they don't let you rap on the telephone
So you're out on the street and tryin' to push dope
When you're out of powder, ya sniff some coke
Then you buy some cheeba and some dust
Then you go on home 'cause ya head about to bust
You started screamin' and you're dreamin' and you're gettin' a knife
And then you take away your family's life
When the cops all come you think it's not true
Ho, yes them cops they take your life too
That dope, coke, dust and cheeba
You tell the cop but he didn't believe ya
Anyway, now you're dead today
No more ridin' with B.J. in a jazzy O.J.  
No more ridin' with Mike C in a jazzy O.J.  
No more K.C. in a jazzy O.J.  
No more Tony Tone in a jazzy O.J.  
'Cause we won't pay the way, check it out!

[Verse 11: Kid Vicious B.J.]
To the beat y'all, you don't stop, keep on
I'm Kid Vicious B.J. and I rock the party
For the jazzy young ladies with the def, def bodies
To the other MC, you're jealous of me
'Cause I walk 'round the block with the jazzy lady
One on the right and one on the left
Got two in the back and they're all lookin' def
With their Jordache jeans and different color velour
You never seen a girl like this before
Because Vicious B.J. know all different kinds
Of jazzy young lady that'll blow your mind
Light-skinned, dark-skinned, Puerto Rican, white
If you're down with B.J. you gotta be alright
'Cause I like the girl with the personality
That make me feel like I'm with the young lady
Kid Vicious B.J., I got a lotta class
That's why you never see me talkin' to no trash
And to the hip-hop, don't stop
Mike C get on the mic and help me rock

[Verse 12: Mike C]
Yes, yes, y'all, you don't stop
To the beat, don't wanna stop
You call OJ, best style, touch of class
You wanna get down, gotta see us fast
You got five bucks left, what you gonna do?
You drop five bucks to see the Family crew
And then you come party hearty and you're havin' a ball
Just a-clappin' your hands to the Family Four
But when it's time to go home, no it's not funny
When you search your pockets and you find no money
Start footin' it home but it's too far
And then you say to yourself that you wish you had a car
But that's alright, at least you had some fun
But just remember us the Family because it's number one
K.C., it's on you
So just take your turn and show 'em what you wanna do

[Verse 13: Kid K.C.]
K.C., to the highest degree
I'm the best MC in history
We're up, we're down, in your town
Just about ready so stick around
Tony Tone on the left, Mike C on the right
K.C. and B.J., we make it outta sight
It's the four MC that make you wanna freak
Tony Tone, my mellow
What it look like when you're on the mic?

[Verse 14: Tony Tone]
Ding-ding-da-bah, bah-bah-ba-ding
And a hip-hop you don't stop
'Cause I was strollin' along and seen a jazzy young girl
Standin' all alone without a man in the world
So I made up my mind and I approached her slowly
I said ""Hey young lady do you feel kinda funny?""
So we started to talk and then I asked her her name
She said 'Call me what you want 'cause it's all the same""
So we talked and we walked, it seemed like forever
But due to the time, I got to know her better
You're my type of girl, just what I like
You got style with profile and you look outta sight
And just before all the conversation was through
I told her leave your number, name and address too
She said ""Hey Tony Tone now whatdya mean?""
I said after today you're my Queen
So let's cut the rules and the formality
You call me Anthony 'cause that's naturally
We gonna party, you people, in stereo
Show ya what ya got because you already know
Tony Tone's a cold crusher
Mike C y'all, he's a lover
B.J., cold crusher
Kid K.C., he's a lover
Kenny G, cold crusher
Kev-Ski y'all, he's a lover

147,I Wish,"[Intro]
Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach, overcometh by thoughts
Of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Hook]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

""There's someone you should meet.""

He waited impatiently

She walked in, their eyes met, and they both stared
And right there and then, everyone else disappeared

But one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
And for a moment the whole world
Revolved around one boy and one girl

In no time at all they were standing there
In the front of a little church
Among their friends and family, repeating those sacred words
The preacher said, ""Son kiss your bride"" and he raised her veil
Like the night they met, time just stood still

For one boy, one girl
Two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly, it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, they knew right away
That this was the day they'd waited for all their lives

""Congratulations. Twins...""

To find a wish Is what I do
To be with you is amazing
More amazing then ever
Feeling the breeze hit me
Hit me as I write this
It makes me breathe again
To write this is amazing
It is worth every second
Only for you will I do
Do anything for ever
I will prove it like never before
How much I love you

You bring me so much joy
Can't explain it in three poems
Poems can't even describe it
They can't describe the love
The love of my life
When the days come
I'll do whatever you want
Because only for you
Is my main purpose now
To help you out and spread love
Love that you deserve
Don't put yourself down
Don't give me a frown
I love you more then a crown
It shines so bright
But you shine even brighter

Kissing you all day
Hugging you through the night
This is my perspective
When we meet
This will be assigned
To fit the gap that was never filled
Love you lots
More then anything
Give you anything if you asked
Just know you're the best
Irreplaceable in my heart
As times grow tough
Only for you I'd do anything",Deleted 3i38383,1995,"[87, 86, 79, 80, 82, 80, 77, 78, 73, 66, 65, 61, 61, 57, 61, 72, 83, 93, 86]",19
155,This Ain't A Love Song,"[Verse 1]
I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye
Baby, ain't it funny how we never ever learn to fall
You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and i played that fool for you

[Pre-Chorus]
I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

[Chorus 1]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

[Verse 2]
Baby, i thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

[Chorus 1]
If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

[Chorus 2]
If the pain that I'm feeling so strong
Is the reason I'm holding on
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong - this ain't a love song

I cried and I cried
There were nights that I died for you baby
I tried and I tried to deny your love drove me crazy, baby

You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin' dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

Before you even started, so what
So long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye?

Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin'
Damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?

All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up, get up
Get up your with up, souped up
Put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not zip up, you lip up, whip up
Hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We come back 'cause we heard
Hip Hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the seventies, find me

So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties

171,Scream/Childhood,"Take me somewhere familiar
So I can find myself again
It hurts more than you know
And I'll ask you, Why?
Why would you lie to me
What was the point?
Was your intention to waste my time?
Thought I was digging deep
Thought I was breaking the bank
But girls like you are just a dime a dozen
Just a dime a dozen
Movie quotes and lyrics still connecting us like constellations
I wonder if I could ever seperate myself from this
And it'll be awhile, 'til I can breathe again
Slip me into something warm

I am starstuck
By something in your eyes
That is keeping my hope alive

[Chorus]
But I'm sick of myself when I look at you
Something is beautiful and true
In a world that's ugly and a lie
It's hard to even want to try
And I'm beginning to think
Baby you don't know

[Verse 2]
I'll take or leave
The room to breathe
The choice to leave you
I'll throw away
A chance at greatness
Just to make this
Dream come into play
I don't know if I'll find a way

'Cause I'm sick of myself when i look at you
Something is beautiful and true
In a world that's ugly and a lie
It's hard to even want to try
And I'm beginning to think
Baby you don't know
And I'm beginning to think
Baby you don't know

There's something in your eyes
That is keeping my hope alive
Cause I'm sick of myself when I look at you

173,You Have The Right To Remain Silent,"Can I have this dance my you're looking pretty
Is there something wrong did he leave you hurting

If you don't want to talk we'll keep it quiet
But sometimes a heartache hurts worse if you hide it
I think there's a chance one slow dance might ease the pain

You have the right to remain silent
Anything that you say as I hold you against me
Will forever be a secret between us two
I've been wanting you but you didn't know it
And now that he's gone at last I can show it
If your heart is tired for the rest of your life
Lay your love on me

So many times my eyes have held you
Tonight please give my arms that chance
If you don't feel the need for conversation
We'll just let our hearts talk while we dance

You have the right to remain silent
Anything that you say as I hold you against me
Will forever be a secret between us two
I've been wanting you but you didn't know it

Yeah, shout out to Milo and Soulfolks
Shoutout to Midwest and both coasts
I'm growing hair on this side, not this side
Trying to make my outside match my insides
Living proof you can get what you intended to
I've been on every podcast that I listen to
And ain't no tickets on my credit card bill y'all
They got my name on will call at the ticket booth
I'm in a rap network, out of placement
I saw Kendrick at Leimert didn't say shit
I saw Vince at the club and didn't say shit
Cause this independent hustle is adjacent
Got in beef with a website 'cause they don't get that my life's real every night
I'm getting bread but I'm still living in the red
If you gon write about me get it airtight
I'm checking last years numbers and it's not bad
I probably need to start another podcast
I probably need to print another shirt run
It's first come, first serve 'till the merch done

My bow's out, trying to mark my territory
For my computer at the bar at the airport
USB charge from a spare port
Small talk and I'm not really there for it
Cause y'all know me
I didn't have a life plan after '03
In LA I went left on my OGs
And if the right hand knew, it never told me
I got a few close friends that I enjoy
Gotta make more ends, keep them employed
Live shows I be on my own
And when the merch line ends, I be on my phone
Reading Twitter takes, checking Instagram
Then I remember that I really hate Instagram
It's getting late, then I remember that I never ate
I got the cake, but I didn't make a dinner plan
Good dude, Good dude, who kiddin' who?
It hit me like a ton of bricks at the interview
I made a audio mural you can walk through
About my Auntie that I don't even talk to
I assumed it was right
Me and Video Dave did shrooms, now we watching cartoons
""Hey Brain, what we doing for the night?""
""Trying to reach black kids in a room full of whites""
I think about the kids Jeremy killed
Eddie Vedder put something on this therapy bill, yeah
He probably made hella bed wetters

175,So Many Tears,"[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

[Refrain]
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears",2Pac,1995,"[96, 86, 80, 75, 76, 64, 52, 53, 49, 44, 47, 52, 60, 100, 94]",15

178,I Can't Tell You Why,"[Verse 1]
Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Aah!

[Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why

[Verse 2]
When we get crazy
It just ain't right
(Try to keep you head, little girl)
Girl, I get lonely, too
You don't have to worry
Just hold on tight
(Don't get caught in your little world)
Cause I love you

[Chorus 2]
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see
We make it harder than it has to be
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

[Chorus 1]
Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay
And I can't tell you why
No, baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why",Eagles,1995,"[100, 88, 81, 71, 66, 62, 55, 54, 57, 63, 85, 89, 89]",13

(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
(Turn around)
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

Every now and then I get a little bit restless
And I dream of something wild

Every now and then I get a little bit helpless
And I'm lying like a child in your arms

We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
'Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time (All of the time)
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Once upon a time I was falling in love
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do

A total eclipse of the heart
A total eclipse of the heart

180,Any Man Of Mine/Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?,"1

I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.

I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.

My tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death

Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.

2

Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.

The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.

The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,
The sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the wind,
A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,
The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.

Have you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?
Have you practis'd so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.

3

I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the
Beginning and the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.

There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.

Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.

To elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.

Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well
entretied, braced in the beams,
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
I and this mystery here we stand.

Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is
not my soul.

Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.

Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while
they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.

Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man
hearty and clean,
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.

I am satisfied — I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side
through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day
with stealthy tread,
Leaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the
house with their plenty,
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and
which is ahead?

4

Trippers and askers surround me,
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors
old and new,
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or
loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful
news, the fitful events;
These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
But they are not the Me myself.
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.

Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.

5

I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.

Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,
not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.

I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your
tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held
my feet.

Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the
women my sisters and lovers,

And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,
mullein and poke-weed.

6

A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full
Hands,
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any
More than he.

I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful
Green stuff woven.

Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we
May see and remark, and say Whose?

Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the
Vegetation.

Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow
Zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the
Same, I receive them the same.

And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.

Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken
Soon out of their mothers' laps,
And here you are the mothers' laps.

This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old
Mothers,
Darker than the colourless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.

O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths
For nothing.

I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men
And women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring
Taken soon out of their laps.

What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and
Children?

They are alive and well somewhere,
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at
The end to arrest it,
And ceas'd the moment life appear'd.

All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and
Luckier.

7

Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I
Know it.

I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd
Babe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one
Good,
The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all
Good.

I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal
And fathomless as myself,
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)

Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and
Female,
For me those that have been boys and that love women,
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be
Slighted,

For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and
The mothers of mothers,
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
For me children and the begetters of children.

Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot
Be shaken away.

The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away
Flies with my hand.

The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy
Hill,
I peeringly view them from the top.

The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the
Pistol has fallen.

The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of
The promenaders,
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,
The clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,
The flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the
Hospital,
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly
Working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
What groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or
In fits,
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry
Home and give birth to babes,

What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what
howls restrain'd by decorum,
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,
acceptances, rejections with convex lips,
I mind them or the show or resonance of them — I come and I
depart.

9

The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn
wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
The armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.

I am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and
timothy,
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.

10

Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,
Falling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.

The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle
and scud,
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously
from the deck.

The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,
I tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.

I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far
west, the bride was a red girl,
Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.

The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
And brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and
bruis'd feet,
And gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,
I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.

11

Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,
Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.

She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the
window.

Which of the young men does she like the best?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.

Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.

Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.

The beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from
their long hair,
Little streams pass'd all over their bodies.

An unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.

The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge
to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and
bending arch,
They do not think whom they souse with spray.

12

The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his
knife at the stall in the market,
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.

Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great
heat in the fire.

From the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive
arms,
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.

13

The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block
Swags underneath on its tied-over chain,
The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady
And tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens
Over his hip-band,
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of
His hat away from his forehead,
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the
Black of his polish'd and perfect limbs.

I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not
Stop there,
I go with the team also.

In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well
As forward sluing,
To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object
Missing,
Absorbing all to myself and for this song.

Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,
What is that you express in your eyes?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.

My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my
Distant and day-long ramble,
They rise together, they slowly circle around.

I believe in those wing'd purposes,
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not
Something else,
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills
Pretty well to me,
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.

14

The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,
Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.

The sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,
The chickadee, the prairie-dog,
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread
Wings,
I see in them and myself the same old law.

The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred
Affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.

I am enamour'd of growing out-doors,
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes
And mauls, and the drivers of horses,
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.

What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take
Me,
Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
Scattering it freely forever.

15

The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane
Whistles its wild ascending lisp,
The married and unmarried children ride home to their
Thanksgiving dinner,
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong
Arm,
The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon
Are ready,

The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
The deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big
Wheel,
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe
And looks at the oats and rye,
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his
Mother's bedroom;)
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his
Case,
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the
Manuscript;
The malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard
Nods by the bar-room stove,
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his
Beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him,
Though I do not know him;)
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean
On their rifles, some sit on logs,
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position,
Levels his piece;
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
As the woolly-pates ho in the sugar-field, the overseer views
Them from his saddle,
The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their
Partners, the dancers bow to each other,
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to
The musical rain,
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering
Moccasins and bead-bags for sale,
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with
Half-shut eyes bent sideways,

As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is
Thrown for the shore-going passengers,
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister
Winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the
Knots,
The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago
Borne her first child,
The clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine
Or in the factory or mill,
The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the
Reporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the signpainter
Is lettering with blue and gold,
The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts
At his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers
Follow him,
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the
White sails sparkle!)
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser
Higgling about the odd cent;)
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the
Clock moves slowly,
The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her
Tipsy and pimpled neck,
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and
Wink to each other,
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the
Great Secretaries,
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with
Twined arms,
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in
The hold,
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his
Cattle,

As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by
The jingling of loose change,
The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the
Roof, the masons are calling for mortar,
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the
Laborers;
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is
Gather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes
Of cannon and small arms!)
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the
Mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole
In the frozen surface,
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter
Strikes deep with his axe,
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood
Or pecan-trees,
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through
Those drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or
Altamahaw,
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and
Great-grandsons around them,
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers
After their day's sport,
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband
Sleeps by his wife;
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.

16

I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff
That is fine,

One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same
And the largest the same,
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant
And hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the
Limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin
Leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier,
Badger, Buck-eye;
At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with
Fishermen off Newfoundland,
At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and
Tacking,
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine,
Or the Texan ranch,
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners,
(loving their big proportions,)
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake
Hands and welcome to drink and meat,
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.

I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.

(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in
Their place,
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)

17

These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands,
They are not original with me,
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or
Next to nothing,

If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they
Are nothing,
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are
Nothing.

This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the
Water is,
This the common air that bathes the globe.

18

With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches
For conquer'd and slain persons.

Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in
Which they are won.

I beat and pound for the dead,
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for
Them.

Vivas to those who have fail'd!
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome
Heroes!
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest
Heroes known!

19

This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make
Appointments with all,
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
The heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.

This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of
Hair,

This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.

Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica
On the side of a rock has.

Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering
Through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?

This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.

20

Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?

What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?

All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
Else it were time lost listening to me.

I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.

Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids,
Conformity goes to the fourth-remov'd,
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.

Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?

Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd
With doctors and calculated close,
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.

In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.

I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.

I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,
I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt
Stick at night.

I know I am august,
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house
By, after all.)

I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware I sit content.

One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is
Myself,
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or
Ten million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can
Wait.

My foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,
I laugh at what you call dissolution,
And I know the amplitude of time.

21

I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are
With me,
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I
Translate into a new tongue.

I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.

I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
I show that size is only development.

Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and
Still pass on.

I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.

Press close bare-bosom'd night — press close magnetic
Nourishing night!
Night of south winds — night of the large few stars!
Still nodding night — mad naked summer night.

Smile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset — earth of the mountains misty-topt!
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
Far-swooping elbow'd earth — rich apple-blossom'd earth!
Smile, for your lover comes.

Prodigal, you have given me love — therefore I to you give
Love!
O unspeakable passionate love.

22

You sea! I resign myself to you also — I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of
Sight of the land,
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.

Sea of stretch'd ground-swells,
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready
Graves,
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.

Partaker of influx and efflux, I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.

I am he attesting sympathy,
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house
That supports them?)

I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the
Poet of wickedness also.

What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand
Indifferent,
My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.

Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and
Rectified?

I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.

This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
There is no better than it and now.

What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not
Such a wonder,
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean
Man or an infidel.

23

Endless unfolding of words of ages!
And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.

A word of the faith that never balks,
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time
Absolutely.

It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.

I accept Reality and dare not question it,
Materialism first and last imbuing.

Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a
Grammar of the old cartouches,
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown
Seas,
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a
Mathematician.

Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.

Less the reminders of properties told my words,
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor
men and women fully equipt,
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.

24

Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.

No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,
No more modest than immodest.

Unscrew the locks from the doors!
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!

Whoever degrades another degrades me,
And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.

Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the
current and index.

I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.

Through me many long dumb voices,
Voices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,
Voices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
Of the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.

Through me forbidden voices,
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.

I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.

I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.

Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,
The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,
This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.

If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,
Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
Root of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
Mix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
Sun so generous it shall be you!
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.

I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of
My faintest wish,
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the
Friendship I take again.

That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the
Metaphysics of books.

To behold the day-break!
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
The air tastes good to my palate.

Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,
Freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.

Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.

The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
The heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!

25

Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill
Me,
If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.

We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the
Day-break.

My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes
Of worlds.

Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,
Walt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?

Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of
Articulation,
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are
Folded?
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
I underlying causes to balance them at last,

My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the
Meaning of all things,
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in
Search of this day.)

My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I
Really am,
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward
You.

Writing and talk do not prove me,
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.

26

Now I will do nothing but listen,
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute
Toward it.

I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of
Flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or
Following,
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the
Day and night,
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh
Of work-people at their meals,
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the
Sick,
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips
Pronouncing a death-sentence,
The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,
The refrain of the anchor-lifters,
The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of
Swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory
Tinkles and color'd lights,
The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching
Cars,

The slow march play'd at the head of the association marching
Two and two,
(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with
Black muslin.)

I hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)
I hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.

I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
Ah this indeed is music — this suits me.

A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.

I hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd
Them,
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent
Waves,
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
Steep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in
Fakes of death,
At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
And that we call Being.

27

To be in any form, what is that?
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back
Thither,)
If nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell
Were enough.

Mine is no callous shell,
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.

I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
To touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I
Can stand.

28

Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is
Hardly different from myself,
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and
Pasture-fields,
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the
Edges of me,
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my
Anger,
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.

The sentries desert every other part of me,
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against
Me.

I am given up by traitors,
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the
Greatest traitor,
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me
There.

You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in
Its throat,
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.

29

Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd
Touch!
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?

Parting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual
Loan,
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.

Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and
Vital,
Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.

30

All truths wait in all things,
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
The insignificant is as big to me as any,
(What is less or more than a touch?)

Logic and sermons never convince,
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.

(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
Only what nobody denies is so.)

A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for
Each other,
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it
Becomes omnific,
And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.

31

I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of
The stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and
The egg of the wren,
And the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,

And the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any
Statue,
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of
Infidels.

I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,
Grains, esculent roots,
And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
But call any thing back again when I desire it.

In vain the speeding or shyness,
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my
Approach,
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd
Bones,
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
In vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters
Lying low,
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
In vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the
Cliff.

32

I think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid
And self-contain'd,
I stand and look at them long and long.

They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of
Owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands
Of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.

So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in
Their possession.

I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop
Them?

Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on
Brotherly terms.

A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my
Caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly
Moving.

His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around
And return.
I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.

33

Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,
What I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,
What I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,
And again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the
Morning.

My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,
I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
I am afoot with my vision.

By the city's quadrangular houses — in log huts, camping
With lumbermen,
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet
Bed,
Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and
Parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new
Purchase,
Scorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down
The shallow river,
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where
The buck turns furiously at the hunter,
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where
The otter is feeding on fish,
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where
The beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;
Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton
Plant, over the rice in its low moist field,
Over the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum
And slender shoots from the gutters,
Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over
The delicate blue-flower flax,
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer
There with the rest,
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the
Breeze;
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on
By low scragged limbs,
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the
Leaves of the brush,
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the
Wheatlot,
Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great
Gold-bug drops through the dark,
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and
Flows to the meadow,
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous
Shuddering of their hides,

Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons
Straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons
From the rafters;
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its
Cylinders,
Where the human heart beats with terrible throes under its
Ribs,
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in
It myself and looking composedly down,)
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat
Hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
Where the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are
Corrupting below;
Where the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the
Regiments,
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my
Countenance,
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood
Outside,
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good
Game of base-ball,
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,
Bull-dances, drinking, laughter,
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,
Sucking the juice through a straw,
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,
House-raisings;
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,
Screams, weeps,
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks
Are scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,

Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the
Stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with
Short jerks,
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and
Lonesome prairie,
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square
Miles far and near,
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the
Long-lived swan is curving and winding,
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs
Her near-human laugh,
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid
By the high weeds,
Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground
With their heads out,
Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled
Trees,
Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the
Marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm
Noon,
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the
Walnut-tree over the wall,
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired
Leaves,
Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,
Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,
Through the office or public hall;
Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd
With the new and old,
Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,
Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and
Talks melodiously,
Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,
Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist
preacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;
Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole
forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,

Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the
Clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I
In the middle;
Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,
(behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,
Or the moccasin print,
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish
Patient,
Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a
Candle;
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from
Me a long while,
Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God
By my side,
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the
Stars,
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and
The diameter of eighty thousand miles,
Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in
Its belly,
Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,
I tread day and night such roads.

I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,
And look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.

I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,
My course runs below the soundings of plummets.

I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.

I anchor my ship for a little while only,
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns
To me.

I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a
Pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.

I ascend to the foretruck,
I take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,
We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the
Wonderful beauty,
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the
Scenery is plain in all directions,
The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out
My fancies toward them,
We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are
Soon to be engaged,
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass
With still feet and caution,
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,
The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living
Cities of the globe.

I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride
Myself,
I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.

My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,
They fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.

I understand the large hearts of heroes,
The courage of present times and all times,
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of
The steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,
How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful
Of days and faithful of nights,
And chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we
Will not desert you;

How he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days
And would not give it up,
How he saved the drifting company at last,
How the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated
From the side of their prepared graves,
How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the
Sharp-lipp'd unshaved men;
All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,
I am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.

The disdain and calmness of martyrs,
The mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry
Wood, her children gazing on,
The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,
Blowing, cover'd with sweat,
The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the
Murderous buckshot and the bullets,
All these I feel or am.

I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the
Marksmen,
I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the
Ooze of my skin,
I fall on the weeds and stones,
The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with
Whip-stocks.

Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself
Become the wounded person,
My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.

I am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,
Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my
Comrades,
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
They have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.

I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for
My sake,
Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are
Bared of their fire-caps,
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.

Distant and dead resuscitate,
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the
Clock myself.

I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,
I am there again.

Again the long roll of the drummers,
Again the attacking cannon, mortars,
Again to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.

I take part, I see and hear the whole,
The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,
The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable
Repairs,
The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped
Explosion,
The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.

Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously
Waves with his hand,
He gasps through the clot Mind not me — mind
— the entrenchments.

34

Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,
(I tell not the fall of Alamo,
Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)
'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and
Twelve young men.

Retreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their
Baggage for breastworks,
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine
Times their number, was the price they took in advance,
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing
And seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners
Of war.

They were the glory of the race of rangers,
Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and
Affectionate,
Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
Not a single one over thirty years of age.

The second First-day morning they were brought out in
Squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,
The work commenced about five o'clock and was over by
Eight.

None obey'd the command to kneel,
Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and
Straight,
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and
Dead lay together,
The maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw
Them there,
Some half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,
These were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the
Blunts of muskets.
A youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two
More came to release him,
The three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.

At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;
That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve
Young men.

35

Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it
To me.

Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or
Truer, and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.

We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,
My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.

We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first
Fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.

Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
Ten o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the
Gain, and five feet of water reported,
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the
After-hold to give them a chance for themselves.

The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.

Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?

Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun
Our part of the fighting.

Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's
Main-mast,
Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry
And clear his decks.

The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially
The main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.

Not a moment's cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the
Powder-magazine.

One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought
We are sinking.

Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.

Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender
To us.

36

Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass
To the one we have conquer'd,
The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders
Through a countenance white as a sheet,
Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and
Carefully curl'd whiskers,
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and
Below,
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of
Flesh upon the masts and spars,
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe
Of waves,
Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong
Scent,
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,
Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields
By the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,

The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,
Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and
Long, dull, tapering groan,
These so, these irretrievable.

37

You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
In at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!
Embody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,
See myself in prison shaped like another man,
And feel the dull unintermitted pain,
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and
Keep watch,
It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.

Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd
To him and walk by his side,
(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with
Sweat on my twitching lips.)

Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am
Tried and sentenced.

Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the
Last gasp,
My face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me
People retreat.

Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in
Them,
I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.

38

Enough! enough! enough!
Somehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!
Give me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,
Dreams, gaping,
I discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.

That I could forget the mockers and insults!
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the
Bludgeons and hammers!
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion
And bloody crowning!

I remember now,
I resume the overstaid fraction,
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or
To any graves,
Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.

I troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an
Average unending procession,
Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of
Years.

Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.

39

The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?
Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?

Is he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?
Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?
The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?

Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,
They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,
Stay with them.

Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,
Uncomb'd head, laughter, and naivetè,
Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and
Emanations,
They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,

They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly
Out of the glance of his eyes.

40

Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask — lie over!
You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.

Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
Say, old top-knot, what do you want?

Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,
And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and
Days.

Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
When I give I give myself.

You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
Open your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,
Spread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,
I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to
Spare,
And any thing I have I bestow.

I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold
You.

To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.

On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler
Babes,
(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant
Republics.)

To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the
Door,

Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,
Let the physician and the priest go home.

I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
O despairer, here is my neck,
By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight
Upon me.

I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
Every room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,
Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.

Sleep — I and they keep guard all night,
Not doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell
You is so.

41

I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.

I heard what was said of the universe,
Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
It is middling well as far as it goes — but is that all?

Magnifying and applying come I,
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,
Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the
Crucifix engraved,
With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and
Image,
Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,
(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise
And fly and sing for themselves,)

Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,
Bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,
Putting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves
Driving the mallet and chisel,
Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of
Smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious
As any revelation,
Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less
To me than the gods of the antique wars,
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their
White foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple
Interceding for every person born,
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty
Angels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,
The snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past
And to come,
Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for
His brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod
About me, and not filling the square rod then,
The bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,
Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,
The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to
Be one of the supremes,
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good
As the best, and be as prodigious;
By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,
Putting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the
Shadows.

42

A call in the midst of the crowd,
My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.

Come my children,
Come my boys and girls, my women, household and
Intimates,

Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his
Prelude on the reeds within.

Easily written loose-finger'd chords — I feel the thrum of your
Climax and close.

My head slues round on my neck,
Music rolls, but not from the organ,
Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.

Ever the hard unsunk ground,
Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward
Sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,
Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,
That breath of itches and thirsts,
Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one
Hides and bring him forth,
Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,
Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.

Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,
Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once
Going,
Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for
Payment receiving,
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.

This is the city and I am one of the citizens,
Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,
Markets, newspapers, schools,
The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,
Stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.

The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and
Tail'd coats,
I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or
Fleas,)
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and
Shallowest is deathless with me,

What I do and say the same waits for them,
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in
Them.

I know perfectly well my own egotism,
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.

Not words of routine this song of mine,
But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;
This printed and bound book — but the printer and the
Printing-office boy?
The well-taken photographs — but your wife or friend close
And solid in your arms?
The black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her
Turrets — but the pluck of the captain and engineers?
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture — but the host
And hostess, and the look out of their eyes?
The sky up there — yet here or next door, or across the way?
The saints and sages in history — but you yourself?
Sermons, creeds, theology — but the fathomless human brain,
And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?

43

I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,
Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between
Ancient and modern,
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five
Thousand years,
Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting
The sun,
Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with
Sticks in the circle of obis,
Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt
And austere in the woods a gymnosophist,
Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas
Admirant, minding the Koran,

Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and
Knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,
Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,
Knowing assuredly that he is divine,
To the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting
Patiently in a pew,
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like
Till my spirit arouses me,
Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement
And land,
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.

One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk
Like a man leaving charges before a journey.

Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,
Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,
Atheistical,
I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,
Despair and unbelief.

How the flukes splash!
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts
Of blood!

Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,
I take my place among you as much as among any,
The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all
Precisely the same.

I do not know what is untried and afterward,
But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.

Each who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,
Not a single one can it fail.

It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
Nor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew
Back and was never seen again,

Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it
With bitterness worse than gall,
Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,
Nor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish
Koboo call'd the ordure of humanity,
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to
Slip in,
Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of
The earth,
Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of
Myriads that inhabit them,
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.

44

It is time to explain myself — let us stand up.

What is known I strip away,
I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.

The clock indicates the moment — but what does eternity
Indicate?

We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.

Births have brought us richness and variety,
And other births will bring us richness and variety.

I do not call one greater and one smaller,
That which fills its period and place is equal to any.

Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,
My sister?
I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
(What have I to do with lamentation?)

I am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of
Things to be.

My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between
The steps,
All below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.

Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even
There,
I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic
Mist,
And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.

Long I was hugg'd close — long and long.

Immense have been the preparations for me,
Faithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.

Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful
Boatmen,
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.

Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.

For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited
It with care.

All forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,
Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.

45

O span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!
O manhood, balanced, florid and full.

My lovers suffocate me,
Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to
Me at night,
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging
And chirping over my head,
Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,
Lighting on every moment of my life,
Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving
Them to be mine.

Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying
Days!

Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what
Grows after and out of itself,
And the dark hush promulges as much as any.

I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the
Rim of the farther systems.

Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
Outward and outward and forever outward.

My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside
Them.

There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,
Were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would
Not avail in the long run,
We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.

A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,
Do not hazard the span or make it impatient,
They are but parts, any thing is but a part.

See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.

My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be
There.

46

I know I have the best of time and space, and was never
Measured and never will be measured.

I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut
From the woods,
No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
My left hand hooking you round the waist,
My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the
Public road.

Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
You must travel it for yourself.

It is not far, it is within reach,
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not
Know,
Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.

Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us
Hasten forth,
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.

If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your
Hand on my hip,
And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
For after we start we never lie by again.

This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the
Crowded heaven,
And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those
Orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in
Them, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?
And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and
Continue beyond.

You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.

Sit a while dear son,
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,
I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your
Egress hence.

Long enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,
Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of
Every moment of your life.

Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,
Shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.

47

I am the teacher of athletes,
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves
The width of my own,
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the
Teacher.

The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived
Power, but in his own right,
Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp
Steel cuts,

First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff,
To sing a song or play on the banjo,
Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with
Small-pox over all latherers,
And those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.

I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
My words itch at your ears till you understand them.

I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time
While I wait for a boat,
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of
You,
Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)

I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a
House,
And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or
Her who privately stays with me in the open air.

If you would understand me go to the heights or
Water-shore,
The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of
Waves a key,
The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.

No shutter'd room or school can commune with me,
But roughs and little children better than they.

The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take
Me with him all day,
The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound
Of my voice,
In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and
Seamen and love them.

The soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do
Not fail them,

On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know
Me seek me.

My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in
His blanket,
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget
Where they are,
They and all would resume what I have told them.

I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his
Own funeral drest in his shroud,
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of
The earth,
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod
Confounds the learning of all times,
And there is no trade or employment but the young man
Following it may become a hero,
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the
Wheel'd universe,
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool
And composed before a million universes.

And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
For I who am curious about each am not curious about
God,
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about
God and about death.)

I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God
Not in the least,
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than
Myself.

Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and
Each moment then,
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own
Face in the glass,
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is
Sign'd by God's name,
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er
I go,
Others will punctually come for ever and ever.

And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is
Idle to try to alarm me.

To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,
I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.

And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that
Does not offend me,
I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of
Melons.

And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many
Deaths,
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)

I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,
O suns — O grass of graves — O perpetual transfers and
Promotions,
If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?

Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing
Twilight,
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk — toss on the black stems that
Decay in the muck,
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.

I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams
Reflected,
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring
Great or small.

There is that in me — I do not know what it is — but I know it
Is in me.

Wrench'd and sweaty — calm and cool then my body becomes,
I sleep — I sleep long.

I do not know it — it is without name — it is a word unsaid,
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.

Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.

Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers
And sisters.

Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
It is not chaos or death — it is form, union, plan — it is eternal
Life — it is Happiness.

51

The past and present wilt — I have fill'd them, emptied them,
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.

Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a
Minute longer.)

Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)

I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.

Who has done his day's work? who will soonest be through
With his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?

Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too
Late?

52

The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains
Of my gab and my loitering.

I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.

The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the
Shadow'd wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.

I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.

I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.

You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.

Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.",Walt Whitman,1995,"[95, 76, 59, 53, 42, 38, 31, 37, 36, 36, 45, 40, 40, 47, 58, 70, 74, 84, 87]",19
181,Keeper Of The Flame,"(Terri Clark)

We pass in the hallway
I stop to kiss you on the cheek
But you're in a hurry
You've got a deadline you must meet
You're working so much these days
You don't have time to spend with me
But I keep hoping we might get back
To the way love used to be

I am the keeper of the flame
You only helped me build the fire
And it's getting harder every day
To make our love burn with desire
'Cause If I left it up to you
Only ashes would remain
When it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame

We live here together
But I feel we're worlds apart

When I tell you I love you
You never listen with your heart
I may look like I'm doing fine
But I'm dying deep inside
'Cause I've done all that I can do
To try and keep this love alive

I am the keeper of the flame
You only helped me build the fire
And it's getting harder every day
To make our love burn with desire
'Cause If I left it up to you
Only ashes would remain
When it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame

Oh, when it needs shelter from the rain
I am the keeper of the flame",Terri Clark,1995,"[97, 83, 83, 90, 93, 93, 93]",7
182,Human Nature,"[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why? Oh, why?

Looking out, across the morning

Reaching out, I touch her shoulder

I'm a wreck, I'm out of time
I barely made it out alive
I'm not bent, I'm not cracked
I'm just broken
I watched the fire burn the sea
I wrapped my car around a tree
Hold me up, underneath
This heavy burden

[Pre-Chorus: Matt]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

[Chorus: Matt]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

[Verse 2: Mark & Matt]
Tied up to a heart of stone
I screamed into a microphone
I burned the bridge, so I won't find my way home

Lay with me, I can't sleep
Misery loves company
When I'm bent, when I'm cracked
When I'm broken

[Pre-Chorus: Matt]
There's a halo in the distance
Salvation's barely out of reach

[Chorus: Matt & Mark]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone

I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone
I don't need anyone

[Bridge: Mark]
Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down
In the dark awake, and you're not around
And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion
Fifteen times a day when you check your phone
And I won't be there and you're all alone
'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion
Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film
In an empty bed with an hour to kill
'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion (oblivion)

[Chorus: Matt & Mark]
Torn apart like the brokenhearted
Up in smoke with the fire we started
Misery loves company
I don't need anyone
Smash it up like there's no tomorrow
Leave me here with the fear and sorrow
Misery loves company

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
""Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?""
""He's rapin' me,"" she tries to scream, ""Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughing like it's funny""

Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, biddy-bye-bye, biddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back

188,Not On Your Love,"We both said some things we don't really mean
Sometimes love can be like that
And right now they hurt, but they're only words
They're nothin' we can't take back
But every time we don't see eye to eye
You worry, I might say goodbye
Not on your love, not in this life
Could I ever leave; I wouldn't think twice
Of letting you go, by now you should know
I need you too much
Not on your love, no way in this world
Could I ever live without you girl
When times get tough, I'm not giving up:
Not on your love

When we started out we made a vow
Not to sleep 'til we settled the fight
And there have been times, we've seen the sun rise
But it always worked out all right
Even in the darkest hour before dawn
I never thought of moving on
Not on your love, not in this life
Could I ever leave; I wouldn't think twice
Of letting you go, by now you should know
I need you too much
Not on your love, no way in this world
Could I ever live without you girl

Not on your love

Not on your love",Jeff Carson,1995,"[99, 97]",2
189,I Believe,"[ELDER PRICE]
Ever since I was a child, I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
So what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting, to be teaching of Christ 'cross the sea
But I allowed my faith to be shaken – oh, what's the matter with me?
I've always longed to help the needy, to do the things I never dared
This was the time for me to step up, so then why was I so scared?

A warlord who shoots people in the face – what's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier and always has my back
Now I must be completely devout; I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe that the Lord God created the universe
I believe that he sent his only son to die for my sins
And I believe that ancient Jews built boats and sailed to America
I am a Mormon!
And a Mormon just believes

You cannot just believe part-way, you have to believe in it all
My problem was doubting the Lord's will, instead of standing tall
I can't allow myself to have any doubt, it's time to set my worries free
Time to show the world what Elder Price is about, and share the power inside of me!

I believe that God has a plan for all of us
I believe that plan involves me getting my own planet
And I believe that the current President of the Church, Thomas Monson, speaks directly to God
I am a Mormon!
And, dang it, a Mormon just believes! (A Mormon just believes!)

I know that I must go and do the things my God commands (Things my God commands!)
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith, he will always answer you
Just believe in him and have no fear

[UGANDAN SOLDIER]
(General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!)

[ELDER PRICE]
I believe that Satan has a hold of you
I believe that the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people! (Black people!)
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes...

[GENERAL BUTT-FUCKING NAKED]
(The fuck is this?)

[ELDER PRICE]
And now I can feel the excitement: this is the moment I was born to do
And I feel so incredible to be sharing my faith with you
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith, if you ask God himself, you'll know
But you must ask him without any doubt, and let your spirit grow! (Let your spirit grow!)

I believe that God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe that Jesus has his own planet as well
And I believe that the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri


If you believe, the Lord will reveal it
And you'll know it's all true – you'll just feel it
You'll be a Mormon!
And, by gosh, a Mormon just believes
(A Mormon just believes)

(Just believe, a Mormon just believes)
Oh, I believe! (Just believe, a Mormon just...)

[Lie together, cry together, I swear to God I hope we fuckin' die together]
Shorty I'm there for you anytime you need me
For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me
Nuttin make a man feel better than a woman
Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my booty away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a phat-ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me and I'ma make sure we
Be livin in the effin lap of luxury
I'm realizing that you didn't have to funk wit me
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad love to give, you my nigga

(Chorus) 2X's
Mary J. Blige
Like sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny
With you I'll spend my time
I'll dedicate my life
I'll sacrifice for you
Dedicate my life for you
I got a love jonz for your body and your skin tone
Five minutes alone I'm already on the bone
Plus I love the fact you got a mind of your own
No need to shop around you got the good stuff at home
Even if I'm locked up North you in the world
Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz
I'm your Mister, you my Mrs. with hugs and kisses
Valentine cards and birthday wishes? Please
Be on another level of planning, of understanding
The bond between man and woman, and child
The highest elevation, cuz we above
All that romance crap, just show your love

You said you be happy
With a wife and happy home

As if your girlfriend
Could do the freaky things I do to you
You wouldn't have to time to hang around for my up and down

Deep in my heart
I know I can make you moan
C'mon lets get it on baby
All in my mind

I wanna hold on tight

We won't stop 'till we get it all right
Hold on tight

She ran off on the plug, so I'ma smash her at the Ritz

These two ice cubes in my ear they cost a quarter M

The way that bitch took care of me she might get her a Benz
She suck me 'til it tickle me, slow down the neighbors listenin'
I got on like ten necklaces, you know my diamonds glistenin'
She fucked me then she shot me with her friends, I think she trickin' me
Her nigga know about me but goddamn he can't get rid of me
She st-t-t-stutter step, around the suite in lingerie

But now I'm a big G

Hundred-dollar bills, y'all

That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

I heard a random fan cheer ""yo kick a the poem to get my dome bursting""
I'm sorry fam you got the wrong person
It's fucking embarrassing, they take it as being stuck-up and arrogant but
I'm trying to handle my biz so can I live?

But we made it, recorded this track while I'm faded
You can love it or hate it, I'm somebody favorite nigga
Clap for me, give me some applause
Clap for me, give me my awards
I came to cash out, rock mics and mashed out
Roll up then pass out, until my last [?]
[?] allows me to bomb atomically
Give mics lobotomies, commit in atrocities
From the school of Socrates, my philosophy is criminology
Glaciers of ice on silk Versace like [?]
Boxcutters give you more parts than Rocky
Short and stocking 52 blocks who try to box me
Too many [?] try to knock me
[?] my rhymes for MCs who wanna cop me
Flow choppy, new [?], I keep my game tight, out of the shadows

It's all funny games 'til the lames show up
We came in the same floor but you can't go up
I'm flexing, in my section where ain't no [?]
Don't sleep up in this motherfucker ain't no crutch
Couple chicks on my arms but it ain't no cuffs
Niggas looking real heard but you ain't gone touch
See a lot of young thugs but they ain't so though
I'm James Hunt up in this bitch but it ain't no rush
And I'm burning Niki Lauda but it ain't no Dutch
You trynna find a flyer nigga but it ain't no such
You in the house, Sam Jackson in Django bruh
I am the master, you can get your kango crushed
I'm Zach Randolph in the pink ain't no bluff
Slacked off with this rap shit but ain't no rush
And I shine cause I'm supposed this ain't no luck
Sum up all [?] and concern for you ain't no fucks
This all funny games 'til I scuff my Gs
These Oreo [?] fucking up my suede
You lil' thirsty ass niggas trynna suck my wave
Thought I just told y'all about the fuck I gave
I am Mo Clarett from the Buckeye days
These hoes post [?], that's a buck I save
Can't allow when alimony were to duck my wage
And I'ma die a OG like Junebug Spade
If I ever OD it be too much haze
I ain't never pay [?], I'll just do what pays
What's a 40 oz when your crew cut fade
If any one of my sons throw in too much shade

[Chorus: Guru]
That's all for you, I'm wiping out your whole team

200,My Love Is For Real,"I made mistakes when I played with your mind
Gave you excuses with each story line
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real
Watching you wondering what I feel inside
Deep in my soul I've got nothing to hide

My love is for real
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real

So baby please don't worry
I wanna make it better
I wanna be your only love
This time I'll understand you
I'll never leave your side
This time it's got to be for you

Let's put an end to these long lonely nights
Things that were once wrong now turned out all right
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real
If you ask me how I feel
My love is for real

You told me, you loved me
You said that
I need you, you want me

201,When You Say Nothing At All,"[Verse 1]
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark
Try as I may I can never explain
What I hear when you don't say a thing

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best when you say nothing at all

[Verse 2]
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd
Try as they may they could never define
What's been said between your heart and mine

[Chorus]
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall
You say it best, you say it best, when you say nothing at all

My queen got machine gun hips, better duck once they go off
Takes aim, no intentions to miss, oh-my, so help us all
And it's close to a flight in the midst of neon lights
And my neighbors, they greet me with bags under their eyes
And they know why

And numb from the waist down
It's a Sunday a gun day
Rollin' down a one way
In my 'lac front and back
Over train tracks
On yak and herb nigga swerve
It get's on my nerves, banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane
I'm butta man
Foot to the flo'
What you want from the sto'
I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
Comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
But niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'mma vet you can bet
That I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
Everybody run when I bust a cap
Puttin' Inglewood up on the map
Look at what I do when I pulls my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
Bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Sittin' in the County with a gold record

Caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand, your Honor I'mma changed man
So please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go? and if he say no
I'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough
Cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
Let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

205,Survival Of The Fittest,"[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, sendin' this one out
To my man, Killer B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'?
That old real shit

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Chorus: Havoc]
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God, but shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples
When you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two to four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm stayin' in the projects forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot—fuck lookin' cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still livin' it)
We livin' this 'til the day that we die

210,"Crazy Love (From ""Jason's Lyric"")","Ayo whattup…you now back in the presence of the one n only grand imperial Hands Of Zeus aka the illustrious Thor Molecules aka the mighty Cocaine Biceps…otherwise known as Shampoo Bracelets the panty melter…also known

as the one n only Galaxy Knuckles or Broccoli Bundles the almighty… Yall might also kno me as ya boy Big Ghost aka Volcano Hands the inventor of slaps… Otherwise you might kno me as Phantom Raviolis or the grand immaculate Spartacus Deluxe. I kno what yall prolly thinkin…THIS NIGGA DONE CAME UP…HE HOLLYWOOD…LOOK AT ALL THIS EXTRAVAGANTISM B…OH MY GAWD. I feel you my nigga….I sense theres animosity n whatever whatever. I done started from the bottom n now Im here…straight up n down. I ain't ashamed bout none of that. Im gettin this cake n I'mma still be givin yall the raw uncut while I enjoy this luxurious splendor. Jus lemme flourish tho. Anyways yo….we ain't here for all that so the gawd gon cut the introductions short so we can get this shit on n pippin.

Aight so once again we here to discuss the latest release from a dude who prolly gon need no introductions but I'mma introduce him anyways namsayin…Yall might knohim as that owl-obsessed Aaliyah stan from the great white north wit the exotic budgie tat n the wild flamboyant hand gestures that makes bout 63 questionable facial expressions per minute while hoppin around on stage in a tank top who installed a a showerhead that sprays lavender scents into the air n a stripper pole in his crib n calls hisself Champagne Papi– but yo…hol up son… I mean only in this fake ass industry can you go from bein a silver spoon swallowin jewgro witta blend of melted butter n warm Ovaltine flowin thru ya bloodstream playin a paraplegic lame on a corny teen soap opera to becomin besties witta fake Blood who looks like a cross between a gremlin, a cabbage patch doll n a chupacabra n call yaself Champagne Papi n still be crazy respected by ya peers b… We talmbout a dude who done made songs so moist they could tenderize a steak if you left it in front of the speaker… Songs that could hydrate ya skin n cleanse ya pores n shit… Songs that could make swans appear at ya doorstep… Shit that could pasteurize milk. But yall guessed it…its the AJ Soprano of rap hisself…the 2013 Chandler Bing…the Human Rollerblade…Drizzy Drake.
I ain't gon lie b…I ain't what yall might call a “Drake fan” n shit. Matter fact most yall muthafuckas be like WORD YOU A DRAKE HATER B…which ain't true. I actually appreciate a lot of what this beige muthafucka done accomplished in his career. I mean ain't like I was a fan of ALL that shit but there was definitely joints that I was feelin since back in the Room For Improvement/Comeback Season era namsayin. Son wasn't whylin on some all the way corny shit back then tho. On the other hand he wasn't exactly what you might refer to as a nigga you take too seriously neither. He kept it straight lightskinned n on some boy next door type shit n whatever. He was a “safe” nigga. He seemed like the type of dude who actually knew what the fuck a backgammon board was for n shit. Son seemed like he done got busy witta pottery wheel at least a few times in his life before…shit like that. He seemed like a dude who would kno the difference between a dinner fork n a salad fork n might gon chuckle if he seen you usin the wrong one or some shit…the kinda dude who had hedgehogs or some other kinda exotic rodents growin up instead of a dog nahmean. He seemed like the type of nigga who favorite hood flicks was Set It Off n Jason’s Lyric. Like he might coulda been the type to somersault down a hill laughin or make a short film of a plastic bag blowin round in the wind n have his friends come thru the crib to watch it n make smores n shit like that…the type of dude Alfonso Ribeiro would play on a tv show n shit.
After So Far Gone dropped tho…it was over b. The success of that shit jus opened the floodgates to a world dominated by dudes who never had male role models growin up n females that insisted on puttin the fakest n corniest niggas on the planet (I mean you Tyga) on a pedestal n worshippin em like Greek gods b. After that mixtape blew that was it…like the nigga Drizzy had found his purpose in life n was on some o.d. sucker shit for the next 4 years wit back to back stripper rescue mission anthems n audio manuals for dudes on how to excavate the least masculine traits outta they own personality. But it was a sign of the times g. DMX had fell way the fuck off…M.O.P. hadnt dropped any official albums in like NINE years n shit… Eminem was bout to use his Relapse album to prove that takin 5 years off in the rap game is like tryin to reheat a burger from last week… Dr Dre was too busy pretendin he was in the lab makin an album to actually make one…so on n so forth. The landscape in hip hop was changin namsayin… The year before that Kanye had got his heart broke into a million little tiny pieces by his fiancee n forgot how to make a rap album….so we got 808s & Heartbreaks instead. Which brings me to my point yo….If I had to pinpoint the actual origin of when exactly Drake had got bit by the radioactive butterfly that changed his life forever I would say it occurred the moment he heard track 8 from that album come pourin thru his Skullcandy earbuds.
No one song in the history of rap music ever influenced a niggas whole career the way that Kanye’s Street Lights affected ya boy Drizzy. Son must been mesmerized by that shit cuz his entire career path from that point on basically revolved around tryin to remake that Ye joint in as many different ways possible yo. But he took it a step further than that nigga Yeezy by bein on some wild insecure shit instead of jussa straight obnoxious douchebag genius witta broken heart. Niggas always been like NAW THAT NIGGA DRAKE JUS IN TOUCH WIT HIS FEMININE SIDE…HE HONEST…HE MAKE HONEST MUSIC N HE IN TOUCH WIT HIS FEMININE SIDE N HIS FEELINGS N ADMITS HE GOT FLAWS…HE HOLDIN IT DOWN FOR HONEST NIGGAS THATS IN TOUCH WIT THEY FEMININE SIDES N GOT FLAWS SON. But yo…from the beginning of rap its always been muthafuckas dreamin of havin shit that niggas round they way ain't had. Even back in the “throw ya hands in the air n wave em like ya jus dont care” days. Best believe it was more than a handful of niggas in the BX wit names like Kool Luv Ski that was rockin Jordache jeans n Pro Keds talmbout YES YES YALL IM GETTIN CRAZY DUCATS HUH HUH HUH HUH… or I GOT ALL THE FRESH GIRLIES ON THE TIP… or 1, 2, 3 IN THE PLACE TO BE ITS THE SURE SHOT PARTY ROCKIN ONE WHO GOT THE FELLAS JOCKIN… That shit evolved over time into language that was a lot less corny n eventually niggas was jus compoundin all that shit into phrases like FUCK BITCHES, GET MONEY. But the boy Drake put those thoughts thru his own filter n came wit some suckerfied shit. He put the sucka nigga spin on that. He translated that shit into Fuckboynese for you. He jus spoke to the inner sucka ass muthafucka in you n told it to come on out n join the movement. He seduced the inner sucka in you n told it LOOK…DONT EEM WORRY MMKAY? I'mma MAKE ALL THIS SUCKA ASS FUCKBOY SHIT HOT N YOU GON BE FREE TO ROAM THE EARTH N ALL THAT MY NIGGA AAAAWWWWWWW…. Word is bond this nigga had songs where he was sayin shit like I JUS WANNA BE SUCCESSFUL…I WANNA BE FAMOUS…I WANNA BE ABLE TO TELL NIGGAS WHO AINT BELIEVE IN ME HAHA I TOLD YOU SO…. I WANNA BE ABLE TO SWOOP IN ON ANOTHER NIGGA GIRL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE HE NOT AROUND N THROW DIRT ON HIS NAME JUS SO SHE WONT BE HAPPY WIT HIM NO MORE EVEN THO I BROKE UP WIT HER A YEAR AGO N SHE DONE MOVED ON WIT HER LIFE BUT I CANT STAND TO SEE HER HAPPY UNLESS SHE WIT ME EVEN THO I DONT WANNA BE WIT HER…n put a fucknigga spin on the whole thing. The whole Take Care album was like a Code of Hammurabi for dudes wit white iphones n females who hate rap. Take Care was a manifesto for the entire bitchmade nigga species. But I ain't wanna get into all that. Yall already kno the whole repertoire…the boy Aubrey made it cool for grown men to openly admit all the lame thoughts that go runnin thru they head when they drunk n at they emotionally vulnerable-est n made it so niggas jus started to embrace those impulses while they sober n in a good mood too. To make shit worse you started seein more n more precum babies sproutin up all over the place like dandelions n sharin they own fairytales n fables of not havin no dignity or regard for mens fashion n shit like that.
If you a dude who was raised on soy milk you prolly thinkin why we need shit like dignity n separate clothing sections for males n females in the first place right? Yall thinkin whats so bad bout dudes not filterin out all that ho shit before they start sharin they honest true blue feelings on whatever whatever… Its cuz deep down we kno its some unseen forces outchea tryin to get us to stop procreatin b. And what better way to do that shit than to turn yall niggas balls into some ovaries yo? So THE MAN been cool wit pushin all this fuckboy music on yall…even tho yall be thinkin NAW I BE SEXIN TO DRIZZY MUSIC ALL THE TIME SON…but yo you ever EVER ever ever ever impregnate a female to some Drake joints bruh? Naw that shit impossible b. Unless its some shit like Uptown or November 18th maybe… But thats another topic yo. Ion wanna get way off track n shit. So we gon discuss the Nothing Was The Same lp now. I'mma start out by sayin I was disappointed to see that 5 AM In Toronto ain't on the album…not even as a bonus joint or nothin…which is a damn shame cuz I really felt like that was the best verse Drizzy spit since before So Far Gone…n that beat was cold as hell too. That joint was like my favorite shit for a minute in all honesty b. I remember thinkin damn…this nigga Aubrey might gon have some shit on deck for us when his album drop forreal forreal. Like how the fuck this the same dude who was rappin bout goin thru a chick’s purse while she in the bathroom? But thats neither here nor there since it ain't make the album. Lets get into this shit tho.
1. Tuscan Leather – Aight so this shit starts out soundin like the music from a movie trailer for a quirky romantic comedy that got quirky white folk like Zooey Deschanel or muthafuckin somebody somebody Wilson or some shit in it exchangin witty dialog between theyselves while tryin to save whales n drink warm soy beverages or whatever cuz I never really actually seen none of them fuckin movies ever but thats jus what this shit reminds me of. Yall might be gettin the same vibes… But then you like oh hol up…its that Whitney Houston joint from The Bodyguard playin backwards n shit…like damn this nigga Drizzy tryin to ether hisself on track 1 or what? But nah he serious…n son ain't singin or bringin none of that “do you mind if I suck ya toes for you?” shit he usually be bringin. Right out the gate he wanna let yall niggas kno you dealin witta whole different animal on this album. The Drake who could shoot lotion outta his wrists n spin a web ain't show up on this track. Instead we got the Drake that likes to throw out warnings for anybody who be forgettin that when he not croonin a gentle ballad he also be spittin bars…n summa them shits can be dope. Only thing Ion get is why anytime Drizzy bring up Lil Wayne in a song he gotta talk bout somebody catchin a body in the next line…

“Im jus as famous as my mentorBut thats still the boss…dont get sent forGet hype on tracks n jump in front of a bullet you wasn’t meant forCuz you dont really wanna hear me vent moreHot temper…scary outcome…”
Whatever you say b… Personally I prefer when son eases up on all the tough talk cuz its jus hard to take that shit serious comin from a dude who wore a leotard to the VMAs last year bruh. Only time you really felt like the old Take Care Drake was tryin to pop back up on this track was when he mentioned that “even Ellen love our shit”. Yeah… the old Drake still alive n well b. But that ain't the only shout out… Drizzy had to drop a quick Wu-Tang reference n mention that he be sippin Pora n listenin to Cappadonna… No disrespect but Ion even think people who actually kno Cappadonna personally be listenin to Cappadonna b. You whylin b.

2. Furthest Thing – Aight so apparently homie that was rappin on the last track jus tip toed out the room to let “Take Care Drake” take the wheel for a minute. This the nigga that fans his eyes when he cries spittin on this track…n what you expect him to do other than talk bout his imperfections while he simultaneously brags n takes shots at the imaginary chick he pourin his heart out to on this shit over some somber emo type music…. But a glorious thing happens bout 3 minutes in n the beat his boy 40 hooked up switches to some shit by the homie Jake One. Its almost like the beat jus slapped a hundred naked midgets wit valentines out the boy Drakes ass n helped him act like a man again. I still wasn't feelin all that melodramatic shit happenin on the first 2/3 of the track tho.
3. Started From the Bottom – I remember when this shit dropped back at the beginning of the year. Muthafuckas on twitter was talmbout EWWW THIS NEW DRAKE SONG TRASH BREHHH…so I decided maybe Id peep that namsayin. After I heard it I was like yo…no wonder his fans hate this shit….son really stepped his masculinity up without een breakin away from his regular formula which usually starts wit him either directin all the shit he sayin towards a chick he use to mess wit who dont fully appreciate herself or understand her own special secret powers or towards some random nigga who doubted him while mentionin all the dudes he came up wit who he be keepin warm under his wings. Next he usually name drops some cities he feel like he at home in even tho his hometown loves him… By this point he usually done said at least 5 things to make you doubt he actually got any male reproductive organs so he gotta balance it out wit some tough talk or some nasty vulgar shit to prove he still only human n got plenty flaws but he got enough dough to make those feelings go away n how when ya girl not answerin her phone its cuz he imaginarily flyin her to some romantic spot someplace thats outta ya budget so take that bruh. My reaction to this joint was basically yo…even tho he still sayin some ho shit this gotta be the hardest I ever heard son spit without soundin like a delusional fuckin moron. Son really created a new flow on this shit too. And the beat yo? No wonder sons most loyal hardcore diehard fans hated this shit b…the shit barely got any melodies or nothin. Drizzy stans wanted the nigga who could make em cry til they get the hiccups…n this started from the bottom shit wasn't cuttin it b. His female fans hated it cuz like wtf is this shit a rap song or sumn?
4. Wu-Tang Forever – …n heres where we switch to son steppin back into his old comfort zone. I never fucked wit the concept of this record b. First of all…if you ain't kno already… this shit uses the name of the second Wu album as its title…n it samples probably the hardest song on the album…n this shit is a ballad. That shit is like Michael Buble makin a song called Appetite For Destruction that samples Welcome To The Jungle or some shit…n the shit is a ballad. Word is accordin to the legendary U-God that the whole Clan jumpin on the remix too. I understand that niggas gotta make sacrifices to stay relevant or whatever…but its a reason why a lot of folks feel like the last 2 or 3 albums was wack…n its cuz they hardly ever on the same page these days b. So when Inspectah Deck tweeted out that he felt like the song was in no way a tribute to the Clan n it had no business bein called what its called n then like a hour later his boy U-God tellin a journalist that the whole Clan jumpin on the remix its hard to understand what these dudes is thinkin namsayin. Truth be told the song ain't horrible or nothin but it damn sure ain't what niggas is tryin to hear when they read this song title b.

5. Own It – Aight so now this nigga jus overdoin it… This is basically part 2 of ‘Wu-Tang Forever’ wit the same ‘Its Yourz’ sample except now he switched the “its yours” meaning from how the chick tellin him that all her good stuff belong to him to how he tellin the same broad that his heart is hers. Son I can't een listen to this shit. Only a dude who would walk into a McDonalds n ask for a salad wit lightly steamed carrots n a venti Sprite could make a song this light in the ass. Drake actin like a nigga who jus discovered Wu Tang for the first time in his life on this shit b… We only on track 5 n this nigga done based two whole songs round the same inspiration n shouted Cappadonna out on the intro to the album. Shit reminds me of when niggas got juxed for they luggage in Coming To America n Akeem tells Semmi “Let us dress like New Yorkers” n they come out the spot rockin the head to toe “I ♥ NY” shit. Naw fuckouttahere wit this shit…
6. Worst Behavior – Can't decide if this shit sound more like the unreleased worst song from Yeezus or the unreleased worst song from Magna Carter Holy Grail b. Like forreal how this shit make the album n son left 5 AM In Toronto off bruh? This shit sound like when your computer crash n you restart the muthafucka n restore the previous session n you got like 3 tabs wit youtube videos open n they all start playin at the same time n shit. Nigga ain't een rap til halfway thru the song neither. Up til that point he sound more unfocused n confused than a Swizz Beats hook. Shit jus terrible b.
7. From Time (feat. Jhene Aiko) – This shit sound kinda right yo. The very talented Jhene Aiko blessed this track wit her vocal goodness… The beat is kinda simple but provides the nigga Drizzy wit some breathin space to tell his tales n whatever. Bein that this shit ain't directed at one of them niggas who doubted him while he was on his come up that means its gotta be directed towards some chick he use to mess wit. First verse is cool… Its like he catchin up witta past love interest n shit. On verse 2 this nigga jus start reminiscin on every chick he ever came across in his life prior to blowin up n shit tho. Its like chill muthafucka. Talmbout…

“The one I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree…
I always been feelin like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married…whats the rush on commitment?”
Naw son… get that Marvins Room shit the fuck up outta here. Let Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree live her life b. Basically if you ever messed wit dude its only a matter of time before son puts ya whole shit out there n have distraught 12 year old girls from every corner of twitter all in ya mentions talmbout U SO UGLY NE WAY I KNO Y DRAKE AINT FUK WIT U EVA AGIN BYTCH. You foul Drake.

8. Hold On We’re Goin Home (feat. Majid Jordan) – Not een gon lie bruh. I fucks wit this shit pretty heavy. Besides it jus bein a dope song his lyrics on this shit dont air no exes dirty laundry out n he ain't flexin his newfound G or nothin like that… Of course he gotta sneak in some shit bout how the chick in the song is a good girl BUT…….Drizzy knowin exactly who she really could be. That line in the song basically sums up how Drizzy views broads in general b… They like lost puppies to him who dont kno how to use they legs n whatever til he comes along n helps em figure out how to put one paw in front of the other n shit. But thats minor. I always use to say Drake really needs to stick wit rappin cuz it ain't like the nigga a gifted singer or nothin like that. But he might coulda found his zone right here cuz the song works even for a dude wit limited range as a singer namsayin. Yeah its some lightweight 80s Commodores/Lionel Richie type shit but it works.
9. Connect – This more of that “Take Care Drake” again. I ain't mad at the beat…but he doin too much on the lyrics side of things b.



“Isnt it amazin how you talk all this shit n we still lack communication?How beautiful our kids would be girl…I dont need convincing…”

Cmon son…

“Dont talk to me like Im famous…And dont assume cuz I dont like assumptions babeIm jus tryna connect…wit sumthin babe”

Really bruh bruh?

“She jus wanna run over my feelingsLike she drivin in a 18 wheeler…”

Its almost like J Cole donated this line to him n shit…

The 3rd verse is jus the worlds most pointless story bout how he usin his uncles car for like the third time on the album to go see a girl n had to stop for gas. The nigga even gave us directions in his bars like we tryin to go see her too. This shit ain't really got no purpose in existing yo.
10. The Language – Son brought the Versace flow back for this shit…I ain't mad at it. The beat is kinda like some Eurythmics type shit but it ain't terrible or nothin. I'mma never understand why this dude talks bout other niggas bein jealous of him so much tho… but Im almost startin to not notice when he doin it. Its like son…why you clingin to all this bitterness for? Let go of all the angst n shit b… Jus enjoy ya life or whatever. You ain't gotta be so salty dawg. Son probably be goin on Facebook to look up niggas he ain't seen since elementary school who hit him too hard when they played dodgeball together in gym class n shit to tag em in pictures of him standin in front of his crib wearin erry single chain…

11. 305 To My City (feat. Detail) – I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it…. Jus shut the fuck up already nigga.
12. Too Much (feat. Sampha) – This almost like the ‘Look What You’ve Done’ of this album except he kinda pattin hisself on the back for makin it instead of thankin his loved ones n those who made his success possible nahmean. Also he kinda broken up n upset bout some muthafuckas on this shit again n venting his heart out n whatever . I can't front on the hook n the beat tho…n truth be told Aubrey ain't exactly disrespect the track or nothin like that. He done stepped the flow up infinitely since Thank Me Later… so you gotta give the nigga credit where its due. Anyways this definitely one of the best songs on the album regardless of the feelings bein caught on it.
13. Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2 (feat. Jay Z) – So this the joint muthafuckas been waitin on for like 3 years n shit. Last time these two niggas dropped a duet (Lights Out) there wasn't really no clear winner n shit. This time its a different story tho. But before we get into all that can we jus talk bout this muthafuckin hook for a minute yo? Like its 2013 b…wit the art of DJing slowly dyin out in actual rap music…is it really necessary for niggas to have Timbaland doin this ficky ficky shit wit his mouth? Its like 1. it ain't like they got somebody like Rahzel or a dude who really does this shit well… I mean 2. didn't Eminem play that shit the fuck out already anyways? And 3. can't we jus keep Timbaland away from recording booths already? 4. How they gon use the most classic Wu Tang hook n probably the one of the greatest hooks of all times PERIOD anyways b? But Ion wanna let all that fuckery distract me from the verses. Its no secret that Hov these days is kinda like a pale shadow of his old self n shit. From time to time he still be gettin busy but this ain't the same Jiggaman that was tradin bars wit Biggie n holdin his own or the same nigga who use to cook up flawless verses from thin air in his head n spit em in one take 5 mins later n shit. Either he ain't been inspired to go in like that no more or he really jus losin his touch slowly. I mean I actually appreciated the MCHG album but that shit ain't had a lot of lyrical depth to it…like a lot of the shit he dropped after 2009 basically. Minus a couple highlights here n there. Lets jus be honest b. I mean thats my favorite rapper but he ain't exactly hidin his blemishes too good these days. But for Drake to spit his verse n you like maaaaaan…this nigga Aubrey still salty bout his old classmates n shit but his bars was kinda fire. Then Hov get on the mic n he like “cake…cake cake cake cake”… n you jus like cmon Hov. You better than this son…n you gon take shots at the Broadstreet Bully like 3 years after he dissed you? Ain't he join thru enough anyhow?
I ain't mad at the verse. It was aight. Shit would be dope if it was Nelly or Flo Rida spittin or some shit…but we jus expect more from the GOAT. To add some insult to injury the nigga Drake spits another verse on the Paris Morton shit n lets loose wit all his frustrations wit bein seen as a lil nigga in the game still. Wonder why that is bruh?
Anyways…he throws a couple rocks at the throne n vents n he out. Its a dope way to close out the album so I ain't mad at it.
So thats that. I ain't touchin the bonus tracks cuz far as Im concerned that ain't got nothin to do wit the album itself. This my honest unbiased thoughts on this shit tho…after I heard ‘Started From The Bottom’ n ’5 AM In Toronto’ I felt like yo…guess maybe this fool Drake wanna step his whole shit up. He had also jumped on the Versace joint n it was like aight…I see what he doin. He dropped a couple more hot verses on some other shit. Then he had that wack ass ‘No New Friends’ record which reminded me why I ain't like this niggas music in the first place. But I had the glimpses…the dude capable of better shit than what he get be gettin credit for sometimes. Is Drizzy a salty cornball who can't get a grip on his emotions n has a hard time lettin go of exes, coulda-beens n deceased female music artists he ain't never een met n spends too much time reflectin on the hardships of his upper middle class childhood n tryin to lyrically ether anybody who ever knocked his juicebox over in the school lunchroom or broke his crayons? YES. Did son kinda ease up on all the moist towelette pillow talk n leave the nigga who claps his hands n jumps up n down when somebody brings a puppy into the room at home while he recorded this album? YES. Does the nigga got a funny ass habit of airin out other peoples business n dedicatin random lines in his verses to chicks he once knew (“This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo”)? YES. Is this sons best album? YES. Theres a few tracks on this shit thats jus straight garbage…but Take Care was 80% unforgivable to me bruh. Thank Me Later was aight but son was goin thru that stage where his raps was trash. So even tho he got some bullshit songs (Own It, Worst Behavior, 305 To My City) he also made summa the best music of his career on this shit. Not all of this shit is for me but I won't say shit like Furthest Thing is trash jus cuz I personally skip thru the first 2/3 of that track whenever it comes on. Im unbiased enough to see what the vision here is b. So even tho I had expected a lot more after the quality of the singles he dropped I'mma g’head n give this shit the fairest n most unbiased n accurate rating yall gon find outchea in these internets…

213,Tonight Is The Night,"First of all I'd like to say good evening
And we're so pleased that
So many of you could come out and share
In all the love and all the happiness we have in store for you
We want you to have a real good time
'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
'We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, 'Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin', 'Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mmm...mmm...

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm...hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho...yeah...yeah...

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm...hmm...
You make me feel real, real good
Oh...oh...whoa...oh...oh...whoa...whoa...
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
'Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
'Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There's nothin' phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can't do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

Walkin' to Jerusalem

Readin' signs in Arabic

By the time you tell me I'm the one
I'll be stickin' out my thumb
And walkin' to Jerusalem

You wore your boots last night
You kissed me and held me tight
You said you'd always be my cowgirl
But tonight you're hangin' out
With that Christian Dior crowd
So where does that leave me now girl
You're as cold as Polar regions
I oughta join the French Foreign Legion And Go

Walkin' to Jerusalem
Marchin' with Methuselah
Readin' signs in Arabic
Ravin' like a lunatic
By the time you tell me I'm the one
I'll be stickin' out my thumb
And walkin' to Jerusalem

I can see me in a long robe
Studyin' the book of Job and

Walkin' to Jerusalem

Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya

You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion

And if you too powerful, you get bugged like Peter Tosh and Marley was

222,Mind Blowin',"[Intro]
This is serious business
*Scratching ""The Doctor""*
Y'all ready to get hyped or what?
Well, right about now The DOC and the Doctor
Is housin' the set center stage, pumpin' it just like this...

[Verse 1]
A little somethin' for the brethren
With intellect to truly understand it
It's like a message from the one who's gettin' candid
Makin' a mark on the strength with rhyme ain't like nothin'
When you're pumpin' something that's bumpin'
Did it, 'cause it's like I had to make one
Better than the last one, 'cause a mistake, none
But something new was needed in the mix to
Make it as lethal, so lethal that I would think you
Couldn't be made to invade certain areas
No other jurisdiction, but that was fiction
As you progress, and you're enlightened
And the better you're writin' by never bitin', you're excitin'
To the crowd, club, congregation or gathering
Homies in the street they'll be thinkin' you O.G
Smooth, wordy example of how I'm livin'
A kid in his prime pumpin' records that'll blow your mind

[Verse 2]
The DOC is dope
I would've been down with rock but I'd be broke
By the punk, I'm openin' up my trunk
To reveal, death, livin' it up, my life is like a story
Yellin' it, 'cause nobody else is tellin' it
Checkin' it, always gettin' paid 'cause the rap is sort of a twist
Between what you need and what I mean
What I mean by twist, now you gotta listen
Never a segment in negative
'Cause I’m employin' what you’ve been missin'
So in total, this is one of the many styles of an artist
Hard it may be, but not my hardest
Just a portion, cup of salty water in the ocean
Rockin' it was the notion, it seems I needed a potion
So I asked the Dr. D-R-E could he comply
Lookin' at me with a grin, he shrugged his head and said ""Why
Would you ask me a question
Knowin' you knew the answer all the time?
I make the records, you kick lyrics that'll blow they mind""

[Verse 3]
The DOC is lookin' for a dope beat to lay in somethin' melodic
After thirty seconds, Dre looked up and said ""I got it""
Like the dope sound rollin' with the dope beat
Made me rock a dope rhyme, which was simple 'cause I'm
Equivalent to the greatest, nobody knew before
'Cause I just decided to make myself apparent once more
To deliver to you an order, let's call it a system
A brother tried to play me like a kid, so I dismissed him
And now I'm ruthless by keepin' the crowd groovin'
It gets so rowdy that you swear your chair's movin'
But it wouldn't, it couldn't, it's more a feeling you encounter
When you're rockin' to the music of The DOC and
Dre is on the cut so be wary of all movement
But whatever you do, take the time
To enhance the record by makin' moves like smooth
And I'll keep pumpin' lyrics type of music that'll blow your mind",​The D.O.C.,1995,"[92, 84, 88, 87, 82, 75, 76, 88]",8

Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the (brothers in the party)
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now it's time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's, the teasa's
The one who wants the money and the Visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

Ooh, yeah I like it

Could it be I've stayed away too long
Thief MC's be wishin' I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far, so stop wishing on a star
It's only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
It's no doubt I come real with that, the butter track
The one that makes the honeys hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
Ya see, my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe
Cause when it comes to gettin' down, I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I, betcha by golly wow
Ya never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
See, I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears, dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit 'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb, baby?
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

[Hook]
Ooh, yeah I like it
Ooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City, no doubt (I like it)

225,Connection,"[Verse 1]
These days my waves get lost in the oceans
Seven billion swimmers, man I'm going through the motions
Sent up a flare, I need love and devotion
Traded for some faces that I never know, notion
Maybe I should try to find the old me
Take me to the places and the people that know me
Tryna just connect, thinking maybe you could show me
If there's so many people here, then why am I so lonely?

[Chorus 1]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

[Verse 2]
Real friends, good friends – hard to find, let's face it
Buy the perfect home and there's a flood in the basement
Made a couple dollars now, and I ain't tryna chase it
Kids from Oklahoma, man, we don't waste it
I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40
Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story
Cause there's so many people here to be so damn lonely

[Chorus 2]
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
Can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?
I can see it in my, see it in my reflection
Oh, can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Right now, right now, I'm switching to a new lane
Foot to the floor, man searching for the real thing
Need somebody else, sometimes ain't no shame
Head to the clouds sayin'

It's like can I get a connection?
Can I get, can I get a connection?

Can I get, can I get a connection?

229,"Ask Of You (From ""Higher Learning"")","Brooklyn, New York is our hometown!

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliot]
Quarter waters, all aboard the trains in the summer days
I wipe my brow with a towel from the Barclay's
Daily News I refuse to bust the paper out
So when you eating chinese food make sure you pluck the staples out
O.G, kush got me floa-ting, I sold seed
Got smoke and I don't speak, these streets never know sleep
Breezing off the avenue, the cabbie's catch a attitude
Five dollar phone chargers, but they not compatible
Fuck a hipster, I'm a nigga, Brooklyn born
Banned everything but the liquor, ghetto Qur'ans
I speak songs to the willing and the righteous
Might just wine for the gal in the tight dress
Fuck that, never disrespect a silly record
Less it's disrespecting Brooklyn, you'll get your live token
No you shouldn't, but you will, we armed and aimed to kill
Brooklyn heavy weight you'll never take us under G for real

Brooklyn, New York is our hometown!
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop

[Verse 2 : Meechy Darko]
Dollar van to the jewelry man
Something like a grand for these gold fangs, I'm from the county of kings
Higher learning was a change, and why diesel inhaling grew wings
Nah mean, zombie's the top example why they call a rotten apple
Cut the tail off the city, rassle ain't no longer tattled
Peep my BK point of view like that Spike Lee angle
Rockefeller drug lords, or the judge might hang you
BK breezing warriors, the most notorious
But the bearer of the throne will always be the Notorious one
Mos Def-initely, I'm feeling mighty Fab, puffing on the Jay
Busting rhymes while the time past
Birth place of Tyson, Jordan, get Jackson'ed
Nigga give me your wallet, bitches hand me your pocketbooks
Replace the B with a C, Brooklyn, home of the crooks

Brooklyn, New York is our hometown!

[Verse 3: Issa Gold]
Brooklyn so proper, nigga what you be talking bout
Rebels soul, indigo since my mama pop me out
Enlightened sound we lords of the boom bap ask around
Smoking loud, all my Flatbush niggas love that sour pow
Brooklyn we gutter, blocks patrolled by undercovers
Innocent brothers go under for bag of ganja
But fuck that
Beast Coast bout to take over niggas know that
Spitting that soul rap, disguised the flow so it sound like a throwback
They say you bringin 90’s back, alright I’m fine with that
But all I'm trying to do is bring the motherfucking honor back
Where it started at, uhh, I'm a legend my G
And besides that astrals smoking hash with the master of this shit
Elevated conglomerate, to the game that we fathered in
Put away on some problem shit, for me to work om my proper bitch
Them might beast coast is the holy chosen ones
Like fucking Moses, Park, and fake from the real ones
That's it nigga

Brooklyn, New York is our hometown!

[Verse 4: AK]
Live from the ghettos of Flatbush where one bad look
Could leave you Sam Cooked, that wasn't in your plan book right
Hater, the light bearer, take flight to heights you scared of
Preparing the youth for revolution through these booth intrusions
Bringing our roots back, sun rays within our raps
Gun plays outside the trap, 5-0 be on our backs
They try to box us in, but still I win
Elevating the nation, young GOD, no Satan, my nigga
Stuff your brains with knowledge, power, respect
Most hours lived, no regrets, since I was little a vet
Now dollars what I collect, yes Brooklyn raised me
Dollar vans bumping Jay-Z, this my stop at the fronto spot
I cop a daily, bringing it back to the ave, mixing the hash
The sky's the limit I'm past, we the coldest cats in this rap
Beast Coast no way to infiltrate our craft
Third eye strapped, defeating these demons within my past

[Verse 5: DyMe-A-DuZiN]
The portrait is official, copped it like Winslow
Spark a pipe and bowl, sharpen my mental
Junior High I used to fake sick and get sent home
High School I finally got to take a white chick home
Cutting classes to smash, she was accustom to cum guzzling
Barely even ducking when the nut would splash
Insecurity she covered up with make-up
Me!? I appreciated nuttin' on her face
Now a days she ain't sucking then she basic
As a younger youngin' they would buffen me with braces
Big booty honey's wanna cuff me cause I'm caking
Piggy's smell the piffy, wanna cuff me cause I'm baking, the game dangerous
Emcee's get slain remain nameless
Or upstate corrected like they say sandwich
Your gaining if your a game changer, embrace haters
They say love and hate is the same, ain't it?
Buddy I'm way too raw for you to trade places
And sure man your making dad so proud birthing your styles
Now, I'm murking you out, enter the game verses the child
When we was on tour with the LVRS surfing the crowd
You was surfing the web, poking them hoes, look at you now
Power trippin', rappers be spazzing when the sour lift them
Still roll with who I been with, the difference the cowards missing
Bunch of devoured victims I pile them, and I don't miss em'
Know it's a downer, but in these crowds you are non-existent
How would you feel if you arising where the suns at
And dumb cats are shooting while you flying so you comeback
They want me to walk, and telling me to run that BK never done that
I'm too far to hit them if I were to bust back, don't aim where the bums at
Continue on my quest on becoming the greatest
And show the new New York to our generation
And if you don't know, then you know now, I'm Flatbush, and I'm blowing loud
It's BK, it's Beast Coast, and I'm swankin for my hometown

You said to me that night
That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart
Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong

But now I have to take it back, it didn't work for us

Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

Come back, I still need you
Let me take your hand, I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on, I still need you

Long endless highway, you're silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming, ""Please don't leave me!""

(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah

Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'

Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor

Sending all opposition to see a mortician

Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G

No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop a river running free, no
Can't stop this love I feel in me, no
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop the wind, can't stop the sea
Can't stop the feelin' I feel in me
Night needs the stars, stars need the sky
And I'll always need you here in my life

Oh, oh, oh
Can't stop my love, can't stop my heart
I'm in too deep, I've gone too far (Oh...oh...)
Never gonna stop, never gonna stop
Lovin' you, oh, oh, oh

But if you think you're gonna stop the way
I feel about you
Baby, you're just wastin' your time
'Cause I'm not changing my mind

Can't stop the rain from falling down (Just can't stop the rain)
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round (Can't stop, oh)
Can't stop my heart from loving you (My heart, baby)
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop a river running free
Can't stop this love I feel in me
Can't stop my heart from loving you
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby

Can't stop the rain from falling down (I'm here by your side)
Can't stop the world from turnin' 'round (I'm gonna love you forever)
Can't stop my heart from loving you (Can't stop my heart from loving you)
No, no (No, no), no matter what you do, baby",Aaron Neville,1995,[99],1
242,Bizarre Love Triangle,"[Verse 1]
Every time I think of you
I feel shot right through with a bolt of blue
It's no problem of mine
But it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind
But there's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
Well every day my confusion grows

[Chorus]
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

[Verse 2]
I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

[Chorus]
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say",New Order,1995,"[100, 98]",2

I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find

Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
Run away from me, baby
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy
(Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)

Baby, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most

244,Believe,"[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman—ground-up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes
I just got that air about me like wind chimes (Yeah)
'Nother day in the life (Uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (Yeah)
Now my community's gated and I
Made it and my neighbors say hi (Say hi)
I'm givin' 'em pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky (Way in the sky)
But I still remember the days of
Minimum wage for general labor
Welfare recipient since a minor
Look how government assistance has made ya!
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'Cause bein' broke's a poor excuse
That should only give you more fuel
Show 'em why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
So I Unabomb shit—tick, tick, tick—no remorse, pew!
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on WIC—wick, wick, wick—with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done: nah bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes
These thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise
So you might wanna think it over twice (Yeah)
Or you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead at birth, hugest forehead on Earth
Too short for the verse, studied his formula, learned
How to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better heard
The world force-fed a turd to me, you're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it, but I just get so into it
I was there consolin' you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of the tunnel
So people are always lookin' to me as they're goin' through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear
Shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
When I was havin' trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up like you're tryna fix a flat, uh
When you struggle with despair
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair
Of nuts I'm cuppin', I am your 'fuck it' switch, nothin' can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I give everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me now
And walk out, I will never let you live it down
I'll never quit, do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack
And I know that I always got Proof at my back
I called you ""Proof"" because I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole, homie, I'm callin' on you
'Cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and mo–
–tivation to go, Hussein with the flow
Fake fans that are two-faced didn't show
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul
Layin' vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid, but this booth's takin' its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginnin'
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do?
Use the tools you're given!
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt
As an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?
I used to play the loser/victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days
That dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I'd run in place
While this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
And the hunger pangs once you've won the race?
When that dual exhaust is coolin' off
'Cause you don't got nothin' left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need to go full tilt
That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will

I know that people do go through changes, yeah
But this just dont make no damn sense
If we're gonna keep saying we love one another, yeah, yeah
Well, then we better stop fightin' and arguin'

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, I've heard I'm sorry too many, many times before
Now I know better
It hurts to hold on to this kind of love even more
No, I'm not crazy

I won't be a fool, a fool for love
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy
I'm not gonna choose, choose for you
'Cause I know I'd rather be alone than be here unhappy, yeah

I know it's time to go when I feel lonely
When I'm layin' in your arms and it dont feel right, oh
'Cause every time I'm feeling up, you try to bring me down
So I feel good knowing I don't need you around

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know, I know that I can feel this bad all by myself, hoo, yeah
And maybe thats my best bet
Starting this time, I'm gonna think selfishly
And never depend on someone else for keeping me happy, oh no no

247,Dream About You/Funky Melody,"1. City of Snakes
Eddie runs on stage, jumping around.
In heels as well! Yeah. Runs around some more.
Yes, I'm a professional transvestite so I can run about in heels and not fall over, ‘cause,you know, if women fall over wearing heels, that's embarrassing; but if a bloke falls over wearing heels, then you have to kill yourself! It’s the end of your life, it's quite difficult.
So, San Francisco! singing  San Francisco, San Francisco… Not “San Fran,” no, apparently not! I didn’t know that, I would’ve said “San Fran,” but you’d go, “No, we don’t like “San Fran,” fuck it!” Or what’s the other one you don’t…? Oh, Frisco! You don’t like that either.
( audience hissing ) And you’re a city of snakes, I see! ( Eddie hisses ) Everyone goes to a gig with a snake in their bag. ( hisses ) No other cities have snakes as much as you. I’ve been to New York, no fucking snakes; Paris, no snakes; London, no snakes. San Francisco, full of fucking snakes! ( hisses ) We did that at school! So you call it ( rolling eyes ) “The City.” ( mocking sounds ) “The City.”
And you don’t tell tourists about the weather in July and August. You don’t fucking tell anyone. They’re all going around in summer shirts, going, “Jesus Christ!(mimes fighting through fog) I can’t see! I can’t see! Fog! There’s fog!” And it really shifts it, your fog! I saw John Carpenter’s film, “The Fog,” seen it a few times, and that fog shifts it. I thought, “Well, that’s Hollywood, that’s fog moving really fast,” but your fog is that speed! ( mimes running ) Busy, busy, busy! It could be late to get in someone’s face somewhere! It runs down the road, doesn’t it? Faster than the fucking taxis! pause Of which there are five…
I don’t know what that’s about. You’re a no-taxi city, aren’t you? Five taxis, all going, “I got people in.” Hours! (sounds of taxis speeding by ) Then, when you get in, they don’t know where they’re going. I had to tell the guy, “Get in the back, I’ll drive!” He’s sitting in the back, going, “Well, I don’t know… I’ve only lived here four million years!”
Cable cars are fun. Everyone gets on board and becomes a rhesus monkey. No one talks on a cable car, they just hang and stare… And the guy in the front, with no steering wheel, going, “What the fuck? What the fuck’s this one?” Pulling levers, levers… Is it four levers that just do fuckall? That it? He’s always ringing that bell, going, “Help! Help!” ( imitates bell clanging ) Endless bell ringing! What is he, the Hunchback of Notre Dame? The bell… Him and the guy from the stock market are the same person, I think. At the end of the stock market, they ring a bell. It’s the same bell. Oh, yes. ( mimes writing ) “Never link those two together again.”

2. Squirrels in Makeup
Yes, so I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. Yes. I say that, and people go, “Oh, yeah, yeah!” No, I was, I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. ‘Cause if you're a transvestite, you're actually a male tomboy, that's where the sexuality is. Yeah, it's not drag queen, no; gay men have got that covered. This is male tomboy, and people do get that mixed up, they put transvestite there - no no no no! Little bit of a crowbar separation, thank you! And gay men, I think, would agree. It's male lesbian, that's really where it is, ok? Because… it's true! ‘Cause most transvestites fancy girls, fancy women. So that's where it is. So it’s “running, jumping, climbing trees, putting on makeup when you're up there.” That's where it is!
I used to keep my makeup in a squirrel hole, up the tree. The squirrel would keep makeup on one side, and he'd keep nuts on the other side. And sometimes I'd get up that tree, and that squirrel would be covered in makeup! ( mimes squirrel putting on makeup ) ""La la, la la… Oh! ( mimes squirrel eating ) What?! Fuck off!"" He seemed to say. And squirrels always eat nuts with two hands, always two hands, and occasionally, they stop and go ( gasps ), as if they're going, ""Did I leave the gas on? No! I'm a fucking squirrel!"" And occasionally they go, ""Fucking nuts! Fed up with them always. I long for a grapefruit.""
Yeah. So that's very much like the army-- the running, jumping, climbing trees is, not the squirrel bit-- the trees bit. And I was! I loved the army stuff, which is the running, jumping, standing still, “Found you,” ah-ah, flag, “Look,” hat, you know. Bang! I liked all that stuff, the gun thing… I liked blowing up milk bottles. You know, kill the milk bottles. Boom! Explode milk bottles. Yes. It seems fun - there's this thing of power in you hands. There's all this National Rifle Association and everyone in America is - I mean, 13 year olds keep going out and they get hold of weapons from their grandfather's arsenal! ""I'll borrow the Howitzer, the M16 machine gun, the Uzi…"" What the fuck's the grandfather doing?! This kid down in Arkansas just helped himself to a ton of military weapons, and went and blew away his school!
And the National Rifle Association says that, ""Guns don't kill people, people do,” but I think the gun helps, you know? I think it helps. I just think just standing there going, ""Bang!"" That's not going to kill too many people, is it? You'd have to be really dodgy on the heart to have that… ( imitates gunfire noises ) I think they should just try that, you know.
But yeah, shooting clay pigeons, I think, yeah, go for that. Shooting clay pigeons, they’re fuckers! Come round your house, whiz through ( fly-by noises ) They do nothing, they don't even eat flies! You know? Spiders eat flies, so they're all right, keep them, you know? Flies don't eat fuckall, so kill 'em! And clay pigeons - everyone shoots them in the air. Wait 'til they land! Then go up to the clay pigeon... ( shoots ) Much easier.
Yeah. So! I didn't join the army, as you might have noticed... Yeah, ‘cause there's not much makeup in the army, is there? No? They only have that night-time look, and that's a bit slapdash, isn't it? And they look a mess! So you can't join, even though the American armed forces have a distinct policy of ""don't ask, don't tell"" towards the alternative sexualities. If you're a bloke wearing a lot of makeup, you know… I don't think they need to ask, really! And so you can't join, they go, ""No, no, you can't.It's the wrong shade of lipstick for the Army, I'm afraid..."" And they're missing a huge opportunity here, ‘cause we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise, and so what could be more surprising than the 1st Battalion Transvestite Brigade? Airborne wing! The airborne wing parachuting into dangerous areas with fantastic makeup! And a fantastic gun! And the opposing forces going, ""Fucking ‘ell, look at these guys! Look at that! They’ve got guns. They've got guns! Jesus, they've got guns!"" Ah, bugger. I was so surprised! Were you surprised? I was surprised.
Anyway, so yes, sooo… Also, if you're a transvestite, you get lumped into that weirdo grouping, you know? When I was in New York, there was a guy in the Bronx whowas living in a cave…like you do, and he was coming out and shooting at geese and… ( chuckles ) a lot of weird things going on with this guy; and the police picked him up and they found a collection of women's shoes, and they thought, ""Maybe he's a transvestite.” And if he is, he's a fucking weirdo transvestite! I'm much more in the executive transvestite area. Travel the world, yes, it's much more executive. Like J. Edgar Hoover, what a fuckhead he was! They found out when he died that he was a transvestite, and they go, ""Well, that explains his weird behavior!"" Yeah, fucking weirdo transvestite! ( pointing to himself )Executive transvestite. It's a lot wider community, more wide than you'd think…

3. History
Yes, and I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. Oh, yeah. You tear your history down, man! “30 years old, let's smash it to the floor and put a car park here!"" I have seen it in stories. I saw something in a program on something in Miami, and they were saying, ""We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago!"" And people were going, ""No, surely not, no. No one was alive then!""
Well, we got tons of history lying about the place, big old castles, and they just get in the way. We're driving-- ""Oh, a fucking castle! Have to drive around it..."" Disney came over and built Euro Disney, and they built the Disney castle there, and it was, ""You better make it a bit bigger, they've actually got them here... And they're not made of plastic!"" We got tons of them, ‘cause you think we all live in castles, and we do all live in castles! We all got a castle each. We're up to here with fucking castles! We just long for a bungalow or something.
And I grew up in the 70s, when the careers advisor used to come to school, and he used to get the kids together and say, ""Look, I advise you to get a career, what can I say? That's it."" And he took me aside, he said, ""Whatcha you want to do, kid? Whatcha you want to do? Tell me, tell me your dreams!"" ""I want to be a space astronaut! Go to outer space, discover things that have never been discovered."" He said, ""Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?"" ""All right, I want to work in a shoe shop then! Discover shoes that no one's ever discovered right in the back of the shop, on the left."" And he said, ""Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?"" ""All right, I want to work in a sewer then! Discover sewage that no one's ever discovered, and pile it on my head, then come to the surface and sell myself to an art gallery."" He said, ""What the fuck have you been smoking, eh? Certainly you haven't been smoking in a bar in California, that's for certain!"" ‘Cause you can't! No, no smoking in bars now, and soon, no drinking and no talking! Be careful, California! You're supposed to be the crazy state, the out there, the wild ones, you know? In the future, everyone's going to say, ""Come down to the library, we'll have a wild time, shall we? “ ( mimes dragging on a joint ) “Don't know where that fucking book is, mate, it could be anywhere! There's a lot of 'em about!""
Yeah,so, yes, so that was it. There was a spirit of ex-empire, this thing of “things can't be done,"" whereas in America, I thought there was a spirit of ""can be done!"" The pioneer thing.
""Go do it, what do you want to do?""
“I want to put babies on spikes.""
""Go then! Go!”
It's the American Dream! ""Hi! I'm Crazy Eddie! I put babies on spikes. Do you want a rack of babies? We've got babies on racks! Mmm, they taste of chicken!"" They do! Babies taste of chicken! Cannibals say that human flesh tastes of chicken, so babies must taste of chicken. And chicken tastes of humans. ( nervous laughter from audience ) Good, I'm glad you're coming with me on that.
Yes, so this is all true. And so, yes. Soin Europe, we had empires. Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey! The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason. And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all! Yes, all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.
And the German empire, very organized, they’d always build an empire, “ein, zwei, ein, zwei, “build an empire, very Prussian, and then they'd celebrate with a World War! And then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the war. In the 30s, Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, World War II... the Russian front, not a good idea...! Hitler never played “Risk” when he was a kid...! ‘Cause, you know, playing “Risk,” you could never hold on to Asia. That Asian-Eastern European area, you could never hold it, could you? Seven extra men at the beginning of every go, but you couldn't fucking hold it! Australasia, that was the one! Australasia, all the purple ones! Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up and build up...
And Hitler ended up in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire, so, that's fun! I think that's funny, ‘cause he was a mass-murdering fuckhead. And that was his honeymoon as well! Double trouble!
""Eva, let's marry.""
""Where should our honeymoon be?""
""Well, in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire. I've already arranged it upstairs.""
""Oh, how romantic, Adolf.""
""Yes, I thought!""
Fun! What a bastard! And he was a vegetarian, and a painter, so he must have been going, ""I can't get the fucking trees… Damn! I will kill everyone in the world!""
And he was a mass-murdering fuckhead, as many important historians have said. But there were other mass murderers that got away with it! Stalin killed many millions, died in his bed, well done there; Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians, died under house arrest at age 72, well done indeed! And the reason we let them get away with it is because they killed their own people, and we're sort of fine with that. “Ah, help yourself,” you know? “We've been trying to kill you for ages!” So kill your own people, right on there. Seems to be… Hitler killed people next door... “Oh… stupid man!” After a couple of years, we won't stand for that, will we?
Pol Pot killed 1.7 million people. We can't even deal with that! You know, we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prison. You kill 10 people, you go to Texas, they hit you with a brick, that's what they do. 20 people, you go to a hospital, they look through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Someone's killed 100,000 people. We're almost going, ""Well done! You killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down the gym! Your diary must look odd: “Get up in the morning, death, death, death, death, death, death, death – lunch- death, death, death -afternoon tea - death, death, death - quick shower…""
So I suppose we're glad that Pol Pot's under house arrest… you know, 1.7 million people. At least he - we know where he is - under house arrest! Just don't go in that fucking house, you know? I know a lot of people who'd love to be under house arrest! They bring you your food… ""Just stay here? Oh, all right. (singing laconically ) Have you got any videos?"" You know, you just sit there all day... And Pol Pot was a history teacher. And Hitler was a vegetarian painter. So... mass-murderers come from the areas you least expect it. I don't know how the flip comes over, but it happens.
So, yeah. There was a lot of that, and we built up empires - we stole countries! That's what you do,that's how you build an empire. We stole countries with the cunning use of flags! Yeah, just sail around the world and stick a flag in.
""I claim India for Britain!""
They go, ""You can't claim us, we live here! 500 million of us!""
""Do you have a flag?""
""We don't need a bloody flag! It's our country, you bastards!""
""No flag, no country, you can't have one! That's the rules that I've just made up, and I'm backing it up with this gun that was lent from the National Rifle Association.""
That was it, you know?

4. Royal Genetics
And Queen Victoria became Empress of India. She never even fucking went there, you know?
She was one of our more frumpy queens… they're all frumpy, aren't they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry! Bottom of the gene pool, you know. You're just scraping the barrel there, “We've haven't got enough for any more of you royals there, sorry.” First rule of genetics: spread the genes apart! But the royals are just obsessed with, ""Are you a royal family? Are you a royal member? Well, then you can marry me ‘cause you're same gene pool, and our IQs will go down the toilet.” Fantastic! That's why there's no crazy royals, they're all kind of, ""Hello! Hello, what do you do? You're a plumber! What on Earth is that?""
So yeah. And after World War II, all the empires sort of dissolved. And we didn't - we came first inWorld War II, but we were financially fucked by the end, ‘cause there was a period of time where it was just us and the Nazis, and they'd been making weapons for ages! They had a head start! We were going, ""Get the tanks out! Get the… we haven't got any tanks? Then get that ice cream van out there! Get it out there! Kill! All right,fuck it. ( mimes making ice cones and throwing them ) Fuck off! Everything! Just throw everything at them! Just… that's not… harder! Orange fruities! And Zooms! Throw the Zooms! Fuck off, you bastards! Pots and pans! Get pots… just throw the pots and pans at them!""
So by the time America came in - ‘cause you were watching a U.S. cavalry film, ‘cause the U.S. cavalry always comes in right just towards the end of the film - ( sings charge melody ) ""Ok, let's go America!"" ( charge melody ) ""I love the smell of Europe in the morning! So, how're you doing?"", we were going, ""Fucking ‘ell, where've you been?"" ""Ah, having breakfast. So, what's going on, hey?""
So, America did well, Russia did well, and deservedly so, because half a million American soldiers died, half a million British soldiers died, and about 26 million Russian soldiers died. Soldiers and civilians, and that's just 50 times as many. It's just un-fucking-believable, you know, and no one mentions it! These are just figures I discovered. That's why they put up…’cause, I mean, Napoleon had been steaming in there 100 years before: ""I'm going to kill them, I'm going to kill them, going to… Oh, it's a bit cold, it's a bit cold. Right! Ok, ok, bad idea."" And then Hitler, ""I've got a better idea, got a better idea… Oh, it's the same idea! It's the same idea, it's the same idea..."" So no wonder they set up the Eastern Bloc! They wanted a buffer zone. It wasn't fair, but that's what they did. So that's where they're coming from.
And about 20 million Nazi Germans died, but they did start it, they did start that one. And, yeah, so it was that,and France hated them all ‘cause Southern France was collaborating with the Germans, embarrassing! So since then, they've been kind of spiky and kind of, French... I'm very positive on the French, my family way back was French, so I go with it, but they are kind of, well, fucking French at times...
""All of Europe, you must do this!""
""Well… we're not gonna! We're gonna have a sandwich.""
And Germany and Japan, they do seem to have a natural instinct in a very generalized way for organization and being military, but,you know, there's a very strong Green Party there now, kids with beards, it's getting okay, and I just think Japan and Germany should be the peacekeepers of the world. They should be parachuted in; whenever something breaks out, parachute Germans and Japanese in. They’ll go, ""Look, we've done this before, we've done the killing. Hello! Take it from us, just chill out!"" And then, they’d organize peace really quickly. ""All right, peace, peace, peace, peace is organized!” It could be brilliant if they could do that. That's their destiny, man! Yeah.
Italy invented fascism in 1922. Mussolini said, ""Right, we're all fascists!"" but most Italian people are always on scooters going, ""Ciao!"" And they're into football, and life, and they're not fascists, you know? He said, ""We're all fascists!"" ""All right, ciao!"" No helmet on… ( imitates scooter running ) All those 50s films, like “Roman Holiday,” it's just like that! Everyone's just cool and hangs out.

5. Strategic Sheep
So after World War II, the whole world was going,
""Come on, Europe, give these countries back. Come on, we just had a bloody war; let's give 'em back. Britain?""
""Wha'?""
""What's that behind your back?""
""Oh, it's India and a number of other countries.""
""Give 'em back.""
""Oh, all right. There's that one there, and there's that one…”
“Falkland Islands?”
“Oh, we need the Falkland Islands... for strategic sheep purposes!""
Yeah. And then it was a case of no empire no longer.
But in America, it was different. The founding fathers landed in 16 ( mumbles ). They set off from Plymouth and landed in Plymouth! How lucky is that? ""This is Plymouth? We've just come from Plymouth! We've gone round in a circle. Lads, back on the boats."" They finally got there and said, ""Ah, this is where our God has brought us to! We can practice our religion here, we can raise a family. There's nobody here! Excuse me… There's nobody here! Yes, a land empty of human existence… Who the fuck are these guys? ( mimes the headdress) What's all this, please? No, we don't want any of your food, thank you very much! Just put some clothes on!""
Meanwhile, that winter… ""Excuse me, do you have any food?(mimes the headdress) I love all this, love the idea! ( chuckles ) Yes, I'm sorry, we were a bit brusque when we first arrived, we didn't realize you owned the entire country! But you have no system of ownership? Mmm, interesting! Maybe that can come in useful later… Food! Thank you very much, very nice... Yes, there're more of us coming but we'll keep our promises."" So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naïve, I feel!
Everyone fucking lies! When we were kids, we lied our heads off! ""I didn't do it! I was… I wasn't…I was dead at the time! I was on the Moon! With Steve!"" And your Dad's going,
""I haven't evenaccused you of anything yet.""
""Oh, all right. Well… what is… what's the que… well, I… I… well… what?""
""Did you brush your teeth?""
""No… yes… what's correct? Anywa … yeah. I was dead at the time!""
Then when you're more mature, you do start telling the truth in odd situations. ""I'm sorry, I've broken the glass, I've broken this… is that expensive? I've broke it. I'll pay for that, I'm sorry."" And you do that so people in the room might go, ""What a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.""""And I've broke other things, I smashed that, and that's gone, and I've just thrown the cat out the window and...""
Oh, yeah! So, perjury, you know! If you commit perjury, I don't care, don't give a shit. I don't think you should because you grade murder. You have murder one, murder two; you realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder, so there must be a difference in the level of perjury. Perjury one is when you're saying there's no Holocaust when 10 million people have died in it, and perjury... nine, is when you said you shagged someone when you didn't. You know, it's...
So yes, so in America, the Native American situation, and slavery didn't do very well.And in Europe now we've a new thing: the European Union. 500 million people, 200 languages - no one's got a clue what there saying to each other! But it's the cutting edge of politics, in a very extraordinarily boring way. Because we've got 15 different countries in the European Union at the moment and trying to get them to decide anything is a little bit, ""Which… wha… is it… oh no, here, back up, you… oh, you're in with him! Uh-huh, I'm with… Oh, you're with him!"" you know.
For 18 years we had a government in Britain who was a right-wing government and their policy towards Europe was one of, ""No! No! No! I can't! ( singing with his fingers in his ears )"" And now we've got a government whose policy is more, ""Bonjour! Hola! Tak! Da! ( mimes playing banjo ) Ciao!"" Britain needs to be in the driving seat of Europe. In the driving seat, or in the passenger seat, that's pretty good, you know, ‘cause you can take a sleep for a little bit... ""Are we there yet?"" At the moment, Britain's not even in the European car. We're outside the car, at the traffic lights, going, ""We're going to clean your windows, all right?""
Yes.
And we had the Pagans in Britain. You didn't really have the Pagans here. You had the Native Americans and it was much more of a warrior, aboriginal-type existence, and... we had the Pagans. They were into sex, death, and religion in an interesting night-time telly type of way. And we had the Druids! Long white robes, long white beards, early transvestites, didn't get their shaving together; and they built Stonehenge, one of the biggest henges in the world. No one's built a henge like that ever since. No one knows what the fuck a henge is! Before Stonehenge, there was Woodhenge and Strawhenge, but a big bad wolf came and blew them down, and three little piggies were relocated to the projects.
But they built Stonehenge, and it's built in an area called Salisbury Plain in the South of England. The area of Salisbury Plain where they built it is very ( eerie chanting ), ‘cause that's good, you know. It's a mystical thing; build it in a mystical area. You don't want to build it in an area that's ( singing upbeat jazzy tune ). No, there you build Trump Tower. But yeah, so they built it there. And the stones! The stones are 50 foot high, 30 foot long, 20 foot deep, and other measurements as well! And they’re not from ‘round there, that's the amazing thing! Remember, this is B.C. ( mumbles). This was before the B.C./A.D. changeover,when everyone was going, “Is it A.D. yet?” ( mimes adjusting watch ) You didn't have to wind your watch back, you had to get a new bloody watch! “Oh, it’s A.D., isn’t it? Fucking ‘ell!” And the Muslim people going, ""A.D? Who's he?"" Yes. ( hearty laugh from audience member ) Good laugh there!
So, yeah, the stones are from 200 miles away,in Wales, so these guys in Wales were obviously carving the rocks out of the very living mountain... ""Fantastic, building a henge, are we? That's a fantastic idea! That's a marvelous religion the Druids have got! Yes, got a lot of white clothing, I like that. There we go!"" And they smashed out a huge stone and then they put tree trunks down to roll it along on.
""All right, walk it along, here we go, here we go.""
""Help you push 'em along? It's not far, is it?""
And the Druids going,
""Heave, everyone, heave! Well done, everyone, you're doing very well! You'll love it when you see it. I've seen some of the drawings already, it's very special.""
After 200 miles…
""You fucking bastards! You never told us 200 miles! 200 miles in this day and age - I don't even know where I live now! ( sighs ) I wish the Christians would hurry up and get here!""
And they set all the stones up and the Druids still there tinkering around going,
""No, that stone and this one - can we swap them around?""
So that was the Pagans.
And then the Romans came along with their gods that they had borrowed from the Greeks. They invaded Greece,conquered them and stole all their gods... and renamed them with Roman names, ‘cause the Roman gods before that were kind of crap, you know - Geoff, the god of biscuits, and Simon, the god of hairdos… You know, they had the God of War, the God of Thunder, the God of Running Around and Jumping, and stuff. ""Oh, let's get some of those! Thank God they've got some gods, ‘cause we have these crap gods, you know?""
Yes, the Emperor Fabulous put that into operation and... There should have been an Emperor Fabulous, shouldn't there?
""I am the Emperor Fabulous!""
""Oh, yes, so you are.""
""Yes. And my son, Fabulous II, and him… really interesting guy... “
So yeah, and the Romans went Christian and then we had Christianity for about 1500 years. You know, Catholicism, we believed in the teachings of Cathol, and everything it stood for... Then Henry VIII came along. Henry VIII, a big, hairy king, and he said to the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church:
""Mr. Pope! I'm going to marry my first wife, and then I'm going to divorce her. Now, I know what you're going to say but stick with me, my story gets better. I'm going to marry my second wife and then I'm gong to kill her, cut her head off! Ah, not expecting that, are ya? Third wife, gonna shoot her. Fourth wife, put her into a bag. Fifth wife, into outer space. Sixth wife, on a Rotissimat. Seventh wife, made out of jam. Eighth wife…” ( makes sound similar to putting babies on spikes )
And the Pope's going,
( Italian accent )""You crazy bugger! You can't do all this! What are you, a Mormon? You can't marry all these people! It's illegal! You can't do all this! I am the Pope, I am the head of the Church, I have to keep up… ciao! I have to keep up standards. What have you been reading, the gospel according to St. Bastard?""
So Henry VIII, who was Sean Connery for this film, said:
( imitating Sean Connery ) ""Well then, I will set up a new religion in this country. I will set up the Psychotic Bastard religion.""
And an advisor said,
""Why not call it Church of England, Sire?""
""Church of England, actually. Much better... Even though I’m Scottish myself.""
So they did! That's the birth of Church of England, the birth of the Anglican Church! Disgusting, eh? That's no basis to start a religion on! Nothing to do with the Protestant church,I mean,Henry just shagged and killed a lot of women and then stole all the money off the monasteries. You know, rape and pillage, that is!
The Protestant faith was different. That started probably around a similar time, but that was about Martin Luther, this German guy who pinned a note on a church door saying, "" 'ang on a minute!"" But in German, so, ""Ein Minuten, bitte. Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione."" He was from everywhere. So yeah and so the Protestant faith was sort of tacked on by Queen Elizabeth I a bit later. ""Oh, principles! Thank God! We've got some principles."" Nowadays, Church of England is much more, ""Hello, how are you?"" Much more a hobby-type... ""Hello!"" A lot of people in Church of England have no muscles in their arms. ""Hello, yes... ( chuckles ) Yes, that's what I thought. ( chuckles ) Do come in, you're the only one today! Now the sermon today is taken from a magazine that I found in a hedge. Now lipstick colors this season are in the frosted pink area and nail colors to match... And this reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus! Because surely, when Jesus went into Nazareth on a donkey, he must have got tarted up a bit…”

6. Jeezy Creezy
“We will now sing hymn 405, ""Oh God, What on Earth Is My Hairdo All About?"" ( drearily )""Oh God, what on earth is my hai-airdo...""
There's something weird, something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing. The Gospel singers are the only singers that just go crazy, joyous and it's fucking amazing! And it's born out of kidnapping, imprisonment, slavery, murder, all of that - and this joyous singing! And the Church of England, well, all those sort of Christian religions, which is mainly Caucasian white people, with all the power and money - enough power and money to make Solomon blush, and they're all singing, ( dirge-like ) ""Oh, God, our hope in ages past, our hope for years..."" They're the only groups of people that could sing, ""Hallelujah"" without feeling like it's a ""Hallelujah!"" thing. ( drearily ) ""Hallelujah, hallelujah, joyfully we lark about."" It's just not kicking, is it?God must be up there going, ""What on Earth is that?"" God, who is James Mason.
(Imitating Mason ) ""What on earth is that, Jesus? Jesus Christ! What on earth is that?""
""Don't take my name in vain, Dad!""
""Jeezy Creezy, what on Earth is that?""
""Don't call me Jeezy Creezy! Look Dad, I went down there, I taught 'em to be hang out, be groovy, drink a bit of wine, they split into different groups!
You've got the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Methodists, the Evangelicals, the free Presbyterians, the locked up Presbyterians... the Quakers, the Bakers, the Candlestick Makers... The Mormons are from Mars, Dad, we've had that checked out.""
""And what does the Holy Ghost think of all this?""
""Oh, he's useless, Dad. Got a sheet over his head these days.""
( spookily ) ""Oh... Holy Ghost! Holy Ghost... Holy Ghost!""
""Holy Ghost, this is not an episode of Scooby Doo!""
""I would have succeeded if it wasn't for those pesky God and Jesus fellows!""
Cause Shaggy and Scooby are interesting characters. They're two of the most major characters in American literature. Because, and I mean this sincerely, and I think it's fantastic, because they are cowards. They are cowardly characters - they believe in cowardice and sandwiches. And can you think of any in the whole realm of the English-speaking literature that are characters like that? Cowardly characters that you identify with. ‘Cause you identify with them, you're with them all the way! ""Go Shaggy! Go Scooby!"" The rest of the guys who drive the van, ""Fuck off!"" Scrappy Doo, a Magnum... ( shoots ) ""Thank you, Granddad."" ( general laughter ) Well remembered.
But Shaggy and Scooby; the only other character, I mean, tell me now if you can think of any character ‘cause I'm willing to learn, but somebody mentioned Falstaff. A Shakespearean character!It's that level of greatness! Falstaff, you sort of identify with him, but he has a melancholy with him. But Shaggy and Scooby are upbeat all the time, saying ( imitates Scooby Doo talking ) And you love 'em! You're with 'em! There's part of us that - Shaggy and Scooby at every stage of the way.
So if you travel around the world, and, you know, ‘cause your American foreign policy does give you a difficult time to exist around the world, two tricks: one, say you're Canadian, that helps. It works in Europe, it's very good! And the second is just say, ""Shaggy and Scooby."" And they go ""Shaggy and Scooby!"" International credit card, I think! So yeah.

7. Church of England Fundamentals
So the Pagan religion I don't know a huge amount about, but it was this earthy thing. Christianity had split into many different areas - Catholicism still has the fire and brimstone,( beating drum ) ""Row, you bastards!” You know... Original sin! What a hellish idea that is! People have to go,
""Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sin… I poked a badger with a spoon.""
""I've never heard of that one before! Five Hail Mary's and two Hello, Dolly's.""
""Oh, all right...""
""Bless me, Father, for I have slept with my next door neighbor's wife.""
""Heard it! I want an original sin.""
""Oh, I'm terribly sorry!""
The Anglican faith doesn't have that. You'll never go,
""Vicar, I have done many bad things.""
""Well, so have I.""
""What shall I do?""
""Well, drink five Bloody Marys and you won't remember.""
Because the Anglican faith had a lack of principles for a long time. You can't get really headstrong about it. You can't say, you know, like the Islamic jihads that we hear bout. We get scared about those Islamic jihads. I think we do assume that everyone who is into the Islamic religion is having a jihad every other bloody day. There's a lot of very relaxed Islamic people, and we got to understand - remember, this is very important - and we do assume that jihads are just like, you know,everyday three jihads are issued by every individual. It just seems they're everywhere . ""The fruit shop shortchanged me! A fucking jihad on them!"" Bump into someone, say,
""Hey! A fucking jihad on you!""
""How many jihads have you got going now, Dad?""
""Well, 24. God, it's difficult to keep up with them!""
I just don't think that's happening. But you can't do that in Church of England, you can't say, ""You must have tea and cake with the Vicar, or you die!"" You can't have extreme points of view, you know. The Spanish Inquisition wouldn't have worked with Church of England.
""Talk! Will you talk!""
""But it hurts!""
""Well, loosen it up a bit, will you? Fine...""
‘Cause that's what it would be. ""Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death!"" Students with beards, ( mimes demonstrating with picket signs ) ""Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little Red Cookbook! Little Red Cookbook!"" ‘Cause, ""Cake or death?"" That's a pretty easy question. Anyone could answer that.
""Cake or death?""
""Eh, cake please.""
""Very well! Give him cake!""
""Oh, thanks very much. It's very nice.""
""You! Cake or death?""
“Uh, cake for me, too, please.""
""Very well! Give him cake, too! We're gonna run out of cake at this rate. You! Cake or death?""
""Uh, death, please. No, cake! Cake! Cake, sorry. Sorry...""
""You said death first, uh-uh, death first!""
""Well, I meant cake!""
""Oh, all right. You're lucky I'm Church of England!"" Cake or death?""
""Uh, cake please.""
""Well, we're out of cake! We only had three bits and we didn't expect such a rush. So what do you want?""
""Well, so my choice is 'or death’? I’ll have the chicken then, please.
“Taste of human, sir. Would you like a white wine? There you go, thank you very much.”
“ Thank you for flying Church of England, cake or death?""
“I asked for the vegetarian.""
""Ah, yes, the vegetarian, yes! There we go, Mr. Hitler. There we go... Like a bit of wine? Thank you very much...you Nazi shithead!""
So, yeah. So the Pagan religion had very big festivals, remember, on Easter and Christmas. The Christian religion came along and had very big festivals, at Easter and Christmas. Jesus died on one and was born on the other. ( doubting sounds ) ‘Cause Jesus I do think did exist, and he was, I think, a guy who had interesting ideas in the Gandhi-type area, in the Nelson Mandela-type area, you know, relaxed and groovy; and the Romans thought, ""Relaxed and groovy?! No, no, no, no, no!"" So they murdered him. And kids eat chocolate eggs, because of the color of the chocolate, and the color of the... wood on the cross. Well, you tell me! It's got nothing to do with it, has it? You know, people going, ""Remember, kids,"" the kids who're eating the chocolate eggs,
""Jesus died for your sins.""
""Yeah, I know, it's great!”
“No, no no, it's bad, it's bad!”
“ No, it's bad! It's very bad. It's terrible! Whatever you want, just keep giving me these eggs.""
And the bunny rabbits! Where do they come into the crucifixion? There were no bunny rabbits up on the hill going, ""Hey, what, are you going to put those crosses in our warrens? We live below this hill, all right?"" Bunny rabbits are for shagging, eggs are for fertility. It's a festival - it's the spring festival!
Christmastime, you know, Jesus born to a big jolly guy in a red jacket.
""Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, baby Jesus! And what would you like for Christmas?""
""Peace on Earth and goodwill towards men.""
""Well, what about a clockwork train?""
""Oh, yes, much better. Forget peace on earth, I don't care.”
And, you know, the Christmas fir tree, there's none of them in Nazareth. The “partridge in a pear tree” song was not sung at the Last Supper. They weren't there going,
"" 'And a partridge in a pear tree. Five goold rings!' Come on, loosen up, Judas.""
""Oh, all right...""
"" 'On the seventh day of Christmas...’ Judy, come on, Judy, loosen up.""
""Don't call me Judy, I've told you!""
""Oh! Can you lend us a fiver, Judy? I'm a bit short.""
""All right, lads, Leonardo da Vinci's painting the picture, so everyone get your positions, here we go.""""Jesus, why are you doing the big arms thing?""
""Well, I don't know… I just thought I'd do a big arms thing, I don't know.""
""Well, I'm going to do a big arms thing as well.""
""Yeah, me too! I'll call that the big arms...""
""Look, we can't all do big arms! We'll look like a squadron of Spitfires, for fuck's sake! I'll do big arms and you just look at me and go, 'Ooh, he's doing big arms.' ""
""All right.""
""Leonardo, have you got that one? Have you got the painting? All right, now a fun one as well, ‘member...( mocking laughter ) ""

8. God Attack The Queen
That “Partridge in a pear tree” song, the only bit we like of it is that,( singing )""Five gold rings!"" People go berserk at that point! People come running in from other rooms, ( singing ) ""Five gold rings!"" The rest of it, we don't know; above that, it's just,( singing, uncertain ) ""Twelve…monkeys mating, eleven… donkeys dancing, ten pigmies farming, nine… socks… a swimming…( certain ) five gold rings!"" This is a human thing. We only like to learn a little bit of a song. We can't be bothered, yeah.
The American national anthem I've noticed is a bit hazy in the middle! ‘Cause it starts strong and you finish strong, but the middle bit's a bit, ( singing ) ""And fish in the sky, and a big… monkey pie..."" I've seen guys up there, halfway through, just losing it.
""What the fuck is it?""
""I came second, I'm from Turkey! I don't know! Would you like some furniture?”
But in Britain we don't win many gold medals at the Olympics… because we've chosen not to! It's a political statement! Because we hate our national anthem. Because it's “God Save the Queen,” you see? “God Save the Queen.” Now the Queen lives in a very big house, she has barbed wire outside, and people with guns in front of that. That's one saved fucking queen, I'll tell you! That's the problem! She's overly saved! She has no idea of the struggle of human existence. We have to work for a living, raise a family… we don't have nannies all running around the place. It's what you've got to do in your life, you know?So it's ""God Save the Queen."" No! It's too saved. It's ""God Attack the Queen,"" that's what it should be! ( singing ) ""God attack the Queen, send big dogs after her that bite her bum. Let them chase after her and rip her knickers off..."" That'd be fantastic! Then she'd have to fight the crazy dog with a handbag with a brick inside of it.
""Crazy dog! Crazy dog!""
""Arrgghh, kill the Queen!""
""No - crazy dog!""
And maybe she'd kill the crazy dog and everyone in Britain would go, ""Hey, fair play to the Queen,- killed the crazy dog."" And the Queen would have self-respect for the first time in her life! Yes. It would work. It'd be fantabulous.
But in America, you win the gold medal, I’ve seen you at the Olympics. You stand there, hand on the hearts… You and the Roman Empire are the only people who’ve ever done that, so be very careful! ‘Cause you’re the new Roman Empire, you realize that? There’s no one else going! ‘Cause the only other big power is China, I supposed, but they’re going, “Ah… oh…” kind of thing. 1.000 million, but they’re all just getting ready.
But you’re the Roman Empire, yeah! So you’ve got vomitoriums and orgies to look forward to… Let the President lead the way! ‘Cause no one cares in America and… I don’t know. In Europe, we’re just watching you, and going, “What are you doing?” ‘Cause in France they wouldn’t care, and in Britain, they’d get shot. If the Prime Minister had done something, everyone would go, ( mumbling sheepishly ).
“Can the government say what was happening on the recent affair with the Prime Minister?”
“Well, the government would like to say ( more mumbling ).”
“Thank you.”
But you do sing the national anthem - I've seen you singing the national anthem, and I've worked out how to do it. If you're lost in the middle of it and you're singing the words, becausethe Tannoy systems at big stadiums, you know, it doesn't matter wherever you're singing it. All that people care about is the look,because there's figures on this. 70% of what people react to is the look, you know, it's how you look; and 20% is about how you sound; and only 10% is what you say. So if you look good and sound good, just up there going, ( sings gibberish to a few bars of The Star Spangled Banner ) Big mouth! ( more gibberish to a few more bars ) The eyes! ( more gibberish ) Use that! ( more gibberish ) And keep confirming and denying things. ( more gibberish, up to the words 'Star spangled banner yet wave' )Everyone will go wild! Oh, yeah, oh yeah!

9. Action Transvestite
I'm an action transvestite, actually, as well as being an executive transvestite. I'm an action transvestite! ‘Cause it's running, jumping, climbing trees, you know. So I went snowboarding when I was in Aspen. And you look cool when you snowboard, you just look cool, you know? You cannot but look cool ‘cause you're nailed to a fucking plank of wood. As long as you're vertical, you're going, ""Hey, yes!"" ( swishing sounds )
Skiing, you can be kinda… ( wobbles about ). There's a lot of that stuff, but this is just ( speeding sounds ). And there's only two positions in snowboarding: One is looking cool; the second is DEAD! Right? Pow! So I was looking cool and I was going 50, 60 thousand miles an hour! ‘Cause you have no idea! The police never pull you over. They never, ( makes siren noises ) ""Ah, fucking ‘ell! ( swishing sound to stop ) ‘Cause the police need to be able to walk up to you in that kind of condescending way. ""Ok, Sonny Jim, what do you think you're doing, eh?"" And they can't do that on a snowboard, because they have to go... ( jumping with legs together, then wobbling to keep vertical ) ""Your tail light's out, and… you've got no… knees."" So anyway, that didn't happen. No, I was just going fast, and I fell, and I smashed my head, and... my head was fine. But my neck went, ""Oh, no. Oh, no, thank you.""
So I had to go see a chiropractor in New York, and they're different to osteopaths, chiropractors, because of the spelling. Of course, they're both very powerful figures on the Scrabble board, though... ""Chiropractor... chiropractor... chiropractor... 93 letters, chiropractor."" And they crack your bones, that's what they do, they crack your bones! And they take x-rays, but it’s pointless, because whatever is wrong with you… ""You've got a bad back, I'm gonna crack your bones.” “You've got diphtheria, I'm gonna crack your bones.” “Your head's come off! I'm gonna crack your bones.” “It looks like your mother! I'm going to crack your bones. "" And then, when they crack your bones it goes ( painful sigh ) and then, “Ahh!” but not sort of ( relief sigh ), but ( disconcerted sigh ). All the way up your spine, ""Crack your bones, crack your bones, crack your bones."" And they sort of arrange you into a nice, comfortable ( mimes chiropractor’s actions ) And sometimes it doesn't crack! Sometimes it just goes, ""____"". Then they pull a mallet from their belt and they try to make the noise. “Make the noise! I live for the noise..."" And they do your head as well, around here, and they get it into a nice position, and you're thinking, ""Where the…? No, I don't think it's supposed to go around that...!"" In the end, you just trust them, you trust them. They could havetheir fingers in your nostrils, one foot on the back of your underpants, and they're pushing your spine away with a broom.
""Well, what's this one about?""
""I have no idea.""
( sings fanfare ) ""Wherever he falls, there shall he be buried.""

10. Heimlich Gesture
Also, if you're in a restaurant and you're choking to death, you can say the magic words, ""Heimlich maneuver."" If you're just coughing and got some, you say, ""Heimlich maneuver,"" and all will be well. The trouble is, it's very difficult to say ""Heimlich maneuver"" when you're choking to death. Yeah.
( mumbling and coughing )
""Your hymen’s been removed?""
""No no. ( more mumbling and coughing )
""You need it removed? Right…""
I don't know how you remove a hymen... But yeah. No, Heimlich maneuver,developed by Dr. Heimlich who woke up one night, obviously, and went,
""A fist, a hand, hoocha hoocha hoocha... lobster! Yes, Hilda! Hilda! Wake up, Hilda!""
""Oh, what is it, Dr. Heimlich?""
""Why are you calling me Dr. Heimlich? I'm you're husband, for fuck's sake! Loosen up, don't be so bloody Prussian.""
""Well, what is it, Günther?""
""I have invented a maneuver!""
""What are you, a bloody tank commander now?""
""No! My name is going to be famous in restaurants!""
I don't think he actually did it that way. I don't think it was ( snaps fingers ) a wing and a prayer, I think he must have experimented. He was German, organized.
( German accent ) ""Ok, Hans, I want you to swallow this golf ball...""
( choking and coughing ) “I cannot breath.""
“I know you cannot breath. I will now make you breath with the cunning use of..."" ( muffled shot)
“I still cannot breath.""
""Ok, maybe not, maybe this will… ( muffled shot )
“Jesus fucking Christ!”
""Ok, then maybe with a frying pan..."" Pow!
( Hans coughing throughout, as Dr Heimlich smacks him )
""Must be a combination. No, ok… ""
""Ok, two frying pans… Frying pan in the bollocks… Bollocks stop…
""Frying pan…""
( Hans collapses to the floor )
""Oh, he's dead.""
Other doctors are going,
""How's it coming along, Dr. Heimlich?""
""Well, not very well at the moment. It's not really a maneuver at the moment. It's more of a gesture.""
As the National Rifle Association says, it's not guns that kill people - it's maneuvers.
I'm a film nut as well,complete nut on films. I used to break into film studios; there's a studio called Pinewood Studios near London, and I broke in there when I was 15. And I crept around, creeping, creeping, and hoping that some guy with a big cigar might go,
""Hey! A creeping kid! For my film, 'The Creeping Kid!' You, you're in!""
""Ah, me? Uh, yeah...""
But no, it didn't happen! They were filming tall, angular...veterinarians that day... I didn't have my bag… And my hand up a horse's... anyway. So yes! But we've got known in Britain for making the smaller films, you know. Recently, we've been pulling out of that into the more “Trainspotting” area, but the smaller films, they're kind of “a room with a view with a staircase and a pond”-type movies. Films with very fine acting, but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that. Sub- something or another. You know, just folded in and everything's people opening doors.
""Oh, I'm - oh, what? Well, I’ve - oh.""
""What is it, Sebastian? I'm arranging matches.""
""Well, I - I thought you - ... I'd better go.""
""Yes, I think you'd better had."" ( sings morose melody )
And you can't eat popcorn to that! You're going ( mimes trying to eat popcorn but getting frustratedand sighs ).
Whereas if the film did any little bit of business in America, if the film did some decent bit of business, then Hollywood would take it, and they'd remake it, and they'd up the budget by 50 million and it'd be called, “The Room With A View of Hell!” “Staircase of Satan!” “Pond of Death.” And have people open the door, going,
""You're fucking in here all the time! All the time you're in here with the fucking matches! In here with the fucking matches! You're fucking doing and fucking ( clucking )""
""You don't talk to me that way! You don't talk to me that way! You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife?""
""I am your wife!""
""That doesn't matter! That doesn't matter! I say again, you fuck my wife?""
""All right, yes, I fucked your wife. I am your wife, and I fucked her.""
"" ( Nonsensical ) fucking matches - I can't get 'em... I'm going to drive around town and put babies on spikes.""
( sounds of babies sliding on the spikes )
“Oh, no! Space monkeys are attacking!” A whole new part of the film that wasn't in the original! ( mimics battle sounds )
""Damn, its jammed!"" ( dialing on mobile ) “Janine, I love you really, even though you fucked my wife..."" ( big explosion )
( mimics eating and drinking everything in sight while watching ) ""It’s a fucking handbag. With a brick in it! It's the Queen! Don't know who that is...” Yeah.

11. British Bad Guys
We play bad guys in Hollywood movies because of the Revolutionary War. Yes, there’s no two ways about it. And the French, who were on your side in the Revolutionary war, they play more esoteric characters. They have characters who turn up and go,
""My name is Pierre! I come from Paris. I’ve come to have sex with your family.""
""Help yourself... because of the debt of honor to General Lafayette.""
You know your own history, right? You don't know who he is, do you?! What was it? The Spanish-American War? The French Banana War? What? The Revolutionary War! Hung out with Washington. Lafayette. Street named after him in New York. Forget it!
But we play bad guys, like take “The Empire Strikes Back,” from the “Star Wars trilogy.” The Death Star! The Death Star… just full of British actors opening doors and going,
""Oh, I'm - oh, oh...""
""What is it, Lieutenant Sebastian?""
""It's just the Rebels, sir. They're here.""
""My God, man! Do they want tea?""
""No, I think they're after something more than that, sir. I don't know what it is, but they've brought a flag."" ( cracks up )
""Damn, that's dash cunning of them! Ah, Lord Vader!""
( heavy breathing and in a deep voice ) “Uh, hello.""( cracks up again )
‘Cause he was only impressive ‘cause he had that James Earl Jones voice. ( deep voice )”I am Vader. The Force is strong with you."" If he had a much more,
( camp Cockney accent ) “Hello. Look, I'm Lord Vader and just pay a-bloody-ttention, all right? Luke, Luke, the Force is strong with you.""
""Is it?""
""Yeah.""
""Well, who told you that?""
""Some bloke! Yeah, he said the Force was really rather strong with you.""
""Well, how strong?""
""Uh, as strong as a small pony.""
""Oooh, that's quite strong, that is.""
The film would never have fucking worked, would it?

12. The Great Escape
“The Great Escape,” now there’s a film. A lot of British actors, I’m British, so link up there. Steve McQueen, action hero; action transvestite, linkup there. The story is based on a true story about 76 British prisoners, I think, who escaped from the prisoner of war camp in Silesia, in Poland. They’re all experts at escaping; they’ve escaped from lots of other prisons, and they’re all put together, so they say, “Hey, let’s work together.”
Steve McQueen plays the American guy who is dropped into British films in order to make them sell… in America, that is, because you’d go, “Oh, I’m not gonna see it, it’s full of British guys, and what the fuck do I know about British things?”
I was in… where was I? I did a gig in Memphis, and this guy came up to me, and it was fucking weird. This guy had two kids, and he said, “You British?” I went, “Yeah,” but wanted to go, “No, I’m from Mars, actually.” “You British?” “Yeah” And he said, “Hey, kids! Jimmy Sue, Bobby Will, Fishy Bob!” No, he said, “Talk British to my kids!” I said, “No, I’m not gonna talk British to your kids, you don’t talk… it’s English! ‘ello?” And the kids were, ( shaky accent ) “No, Dad, we wanna go see…” ( Slow, slurry ) “No, Dad, we wanna go see the man emasculating a donkey over there.” “Talk British to my kids! Talk, or I’ll get my arsenal of weapons out!” So that was fun.
So yes, “The Great Escape,” yes. It’s all true, and Steve McQueen is there to make it sell, and he’s cool, I’m totally into him, I’m a very big fan of Steve McQueen – “Bullitt.” Fog… no fucking fog in “Bullitt,” does it? That film, “The Rock,” when they’re all out in Alcatraz, they go,
“We can’t send this nuclear weapon to San Francisco, we can’t fucking find it! It’s covered in fog!
“All right, we’ll have to get Oakland, then.”
( people stirring ) Oh, fight, fight, fight! ( in sing-song ) Oakland, San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay! You’re not called West Bay, are you? No, you’re just( mockingly )“The City.”
“Are you going to “The City” today?
“I might go to “The City.”
And Oakland is just a collection of houses, is it?
So… so yes, “The Great Escape.” In “The Great Escape,” they say,
“Look, we’re gonna do the biggest escape in the history of people escaping from things they shouldn’t.“
“Fantastic.”
And Steve isn’t really a part of this, he’s just hanging out, playing baseball, runs with the van, does an escape, gets caught, covered in mud, and stuff like that; but the British are working away, they’re digging three tunnels – Charley, Barley and Farley. No, four tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally; no, five tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally… Nobody expects the Spanish tunnel king!
And they’re digging away, and there’s people in charge of shoveling it up, people putting breathing apparatus in, putting things on trolleys, lighting apparatus; people disguising the entrance of the tunnel so it looks like a kibbutz or something; people saying, “I’ve turned my uniform inside out, turned up my collar, I’ve turned my buttocks into a hat, and I now look like a German officer… but I have no buttocks.”
“Jawol, mein Herr. So habe ich linge wenige. Locherbekommen.”
“Well done, Simpkins. That’s a line from Monty Python, isn’t it?”
Donald Pleasance is doing forgeries on bits of tin can with a bit of jam. Clang! And on the day of the escape, they’re all there, and Steve McQueen has joined up in the escape, and the British have trilby hats on, overcoats, canoe, a bit of a rabbit… And Steve’s just there in jeans and a T-shirt, disguised as an American man! He romps out, jumps in a motorbike, knocks a guy off, and within 15 minutes, he’s in the borders of Switzerland. This is from Poland! And if you don’t know the geography, it goes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Venezuela, Africa, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon… and then Switzerland, where the Nazi gold comes from. ( imitates people muttering about Nazi gold ) I love the way you do that! Whenever I say something slightly weird, you all mutter. “I’m catching the ferry right now!”
Anyway, so yes, so Steve’s just damn cool, he jumps on the motorbike, and as soon as he gets on, the music cuts to ( sings action film theme ). The British are all down at the train station. “Can’t we do a motorbike? Damn!”
“Yes, a train ticket to… Ich möchte einen ticket to nach… London. No, not London! Calais! That’s nice and Nazi, isn’t it?”
“Ihre Pässe, bitte.”
“My passport? All right.” ( clangs )
( clanging continues ) “It’s a bit clangy and a bit jammy…”
“Yes, I’m from the steel and jam area of Stuttgart.”
The British are getting hassled, and Steve is away, and he gets to Switzerland. Remember, Jim Rockford nicks an airplane in that film, and he flies to Switzerland, and he gets about 20 miles away from it in an airplane! Steve is on a fucking motorbike and he gets there! Before him! What’s he got in the fucking motorbike, jet wings? I dunno!
So yeah, all the British are getting hassled, the Gestapo are after them, people are on rowing boats, some on bicycles, one on a rabbit, in a kangaroo, you know, in pogo stick. Steve’s motor biking away… Steve’s over the first line of bared wire, “Go, Steve, go!” Into the second line of barbed wire… Nearly makes it, doesn’t quite, but lives to tell the tale.
Meanwhile, the British are all rounded up and shot in the head! Now what signals is this giving to kids from the different countries, Britain and America? American kids watching Steve, saying, ( shaky accent ) “Steve, you’re damn cool! Yeah, I’m fucking with you, man, all the way! Absolutely! Lived to tell the tale, good on you!” You know? I don’t know why he’s Australian, but anyway… “Absolutely. G’day.” But we’re just watching it and thinking, “We’re fucked! All that planning, the logistics, everything, and we get fucking blown away.” Chip on my- fish and chips on my shoulder.

13. Engelbert and JFK
And Engelbert Humperdinck! Yes, he was the man. That's not his real name; he's from Britain, but that's not his name. There's very few Humperdincks in Britain. He was born Gerry Dorsey, not Engelbert Humperdinck. His parents were not Mr. and Mrs. Humperdinck. They never said,
""What shall we call our son so he does not get the shit kicked out of him at school?""
“We shall call him Engelbert!""
""Good, that'll work!""
No, his name was Gerry Dorsey, and he released songs as Gerry Dorsey, songs such as ( mumbles )which didn't work ‘cause nobody could hear what he was saying. And then his managers, obviously, said, ""We're going to change your name, Gerry! It's the name that's the problem."" And his name changed from Gerry Dorsey to Engelbert Humperdinck. I mean, I just wanted to be in the room when they were working that one through.
""Zingelbert Bembledack! Yingybert Dambleban! Zangelbert Bingledack! Wingelbert Humptyback! Slut Bunwalla!""
""What?!""
""All right, Kringelbert Fishtybuns! Steviebuns Bottrittrundle...""
""No, Gerry Dorsey, I like Gerry Dorsey!""
""No, we can't do it... Who we got? Zingelbert Bembledack, Tringelbert Wangledack, Slut Bunwalla, Klingybun Fistelvase, Dindlebert Zindledack, Gerry Dorsey, Engelbert Humptyback, Zengelbert Bingledack, Engelbert Humperdinck, Vingelbert Wingledanck…""
""No, no, go back one. Go back one. ""Engelbert Humperdinck."" That's it.""
And it worked! But he's dead now, you hear that? Yeah, today, on CNN. I heard it as I was just coming out. Very weird, ‘cause Frank Sinatra was just recently as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Hmm. No, this is what I heard on the telly when I coming out. ( inhales deeply and exhales ) It's not true, heh. ( exhales ) No, it is true. Yeah, he was L.A. Something happened. He was in L.A., and that's all I caught… it was just before I came out. So, yeah. ( exhales ) No, it is true. No, he was in a car in L.A. driving along and something hit him or something like that. ( about 25 seconds of pauses and audience laughter, as Eddie nods and denies the truth of this statement ) No no, no, he's all right, he's all right! He's fine! He's cooking, he's jumping, he's doing his thing in L.A. - he's absolutely fine. How do I know? I don't know, I don't know! I think he's got a cold, that's what they said. No, a tan, that's it!
But back in the 60s, though, back in the 60s, President Kennedy became the President of the United States of America, and he we went to Berlin, stood on the Berlin wall and he said, ""People of Berlin..."" ( hearty American )”People of Berlin."" I can't do an impression of President Kennedy, so this is... ""People of Berlin. Amy dumped…"" No, James Mason playing him... ( imitates Mason ) “ People of Berlin, I have come to you to tell you something about the American states. I sound a bit like God, don't I? Yes. But I have come to say to you that every free citizen of the world is a citizen of Berlin. And I wish to say to you, 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' "" And the crowd went fucking wild!
Trouble is, ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" means ""I am a donut,"" and... This is true, and this is what he said, he said ""I am a donut!"" And, as I say, 70% of how you look, 20% of how you sound, only 10% is what you say. He said ""I am a donut"" and they went wild! Because ""Ich bin Berliner"" is ""I am a Berliner."" But ""Ich bin ein Berliner,"" is - that's the name of a donut they have there. And it's like going to Frankfurt:
""I am a Frankfurter!""
""Yeah, we've heard about that one, Jackie.""
Hamburg - ""I am a Hamburger, too!"" Lucky he didn't do a tour of Germany, eh? ""I am a Hamburger, a Frankfurter, and a donut."" But the people in Berlin must've gone,
""What did he say?""
""He said he was a donut!""
""I thought he said he was a donut too!""
""So what does that mean?""
""It's a slang! It's American! He's a donut! He's a fucking donut. Fucking donut, a fucking donut, a fucking donut. He's a fucking donut. I think that's what it must mean.”
“What do you think, Dr. Heimlich?""
""Huh? ( coughing throughout ) I don't…I don't know, I have swallowed a football and I can'tget it out. Can you perform my maneuver on me, the me maneuver?""
""Huh?""
""Hilda, Hilda, get me a map of everything.""
He also made a speech about space. President Kennedy said, ""By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Moon."" At the same time, our Prime Minister in Britain, Sir Dingly Dang... You don't know anyway, do you? You have no idea! It was Sir Fritz Bunwalla. Engelbert Slaptyback, who was Prime Minister at the time, and he stood up and he said, ""By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Earth!"" And so he did. But it was kinda weird, ’cause we couldn't do the space race. We had no money, you know, rationing didn't stop 'til the year 2001! I still haven't even lived that long. But anyway,we just didn't have any money. So you were getting space rockets, testing them, sending a cat, dog, a fish, a monkey up into space. The fish was interesting! We didn't have enough money to put a man in a track suit up a ladder! I mean, I would've been there,
""Go man, go!"" ""
I'm going, I'm going! 'Ang on!""
""Just hang on to the ladder!""
""Hello, Swindon, I am here. Swindon, can you hear me?""
""Swindon here, we are monitoring you on our instruments at the moment, we've got you on a tuba.” “There should be a bigger laugh for that joke, I think.""
""Yeah, I can't quite understand it; I thought it was really funny. Swindon, a knackered, kind of Fresno town.""
""They don't seem to be going for it.”
“They're obviously bastards.""
""Anyway,Swindon, I'm nearly at the Moon… actually, that's a bit of an understatement, that one.
Have you got another big ladder, another bit of ladder? I don't think we're quite at the Moon yet, but I can see right over the top of the houses! Fantastic!""

14. Moon Monsters
But they went to the Moon, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,and Michael Collins, going round and round, working out the IRA thing. And Neil stepped on the Moon and said, ""One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind."" Good line but not his line, I don't think… it didn't feel like his line, you know? I bet that was just given to him and he was coming down the steps going, ""Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Don't get it wrong, Neil. Don't fuck it up. Here we go. I'm a small man with a giant big - shit!... One man, small giant, two...two mens... What was it?"" ‘Cause you gotta say something, you can't go down to the Moon and go, ""Oh, it's all sticky! It's covered in jam!"" You can't land on the Moon and go, ""Fucking ‘ell, I've been in that spacecraft ( stretching noises ) Right, I need a piss."" You can't land on the Moon and wind down the window and go, ""Is this - Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? Is this Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? There's no one around!” But he had a sense of humor so he should have used it, ‘cause there was that lunar module there – a fixed camera, just fixed, not panning left or right, just stationary. So he could've been there saying, ""Hi, people on the Moon. As you can see, the Sea of Tranquility here, there's the mountains in the distance, there's the Earth! There, you're looking back up at yourselves there. Over to my right, I can see a fucking monster! There's a monster behind me! ( screaming ) Oh no, help! Get off my leg!"" Buzz Aldrin in a monster outfit ( growling ) Neil doing a close-up with… ""He's got me, Houston. The monster's got me! He wants cash! He's got my hand up behind my back. I think he knows jiu-jitsu! He wants cash for the release of my life. Send a million… - two million dollars, leave it in a bag by the Sea of Tranquility. I don't know, the North Shore! What the fucking ‘ell...?"" Oh, it would have worked, wouldn't it?
But they went to the Moon and they brought back rock. They brought back rock! Trouble is, we’ve got rock. That was the one thing we didn’t need, wasn’t it?
“Rock, Neil? I don’t know whether you looked at the planet before you took off, but it’s made of fucking rock!”
“But it’s Moon rock…”
“Oh, fucking hell! This is Earth rock, Neil, come on! ( mocking ) Earth rock with special minerals. It’s rock, isn’t it? Have you heard? On the stock market, rock’s gone up three points! No, it hasn’t, has it? ‘Cause it’s fucking rock! We wanted diamonds, or sherbet or a squirrel with a gun!”
So they went to the Moon and they found rock. They’ve found ice as well recently, so it’s rocks and ice. What an exciting planet! Obviously a party planet. And they went to mars and found more rock, but it’s red this time, so… We’ve got the most boring solar system I’ve ever heard of…! And I’ve never heard of any!
And no monsters, either! Not one fucking monster has turned up in the history of looking. ‘Cause we’ve been ready for monsters, we’ve been waiting for them for so long! Pictures of monsters, stories of monsters, documentaries of monsters, films, programs, television things- not one fucking monster! Nothing, not even a squirrel with a flute has turned up. ( sings jaunty flute tune )
“Monster! Very small monster!”
“Get the flute off him, that’s where he gets his power!”
I think the world needs monsters, I think we need them because we’ve got this thing of… Humans are very good with a little bit of adversity, not too much, but enough. It’s like in the Cold War- World War II is better, the Cold War was just a negative thing. World War II had everyone pulling together against something, and there was some positive stuff that came out of it. Now that the Cold War is gone, everything is loose and free. Everyone’s a bit obsessed with upstairs,have you noticed? All the films lately, “The X Files,” “Independence Day,” “Armageddon,” “Deep Impact,” “Deep Throat…” All these things. We’re all looking upstairs now.
And in America, terrorism is starting to happen. You know, the Oklahoma City bombing, which everyone was sure was some Islamic fundamentalist thing, and you found out it was some white guys from nearby. That must have freaked you out something rotten! “These guys from around the corner? They look like us! Oh, fuck!” Yeah, bit of a weird one.
And the Aryan supremacists have come around with their ideas of “get some chemical weapons and kill people.” And you say,
“What’s the plan? What does that achieve?”
“Nothing, really.”
And it won’t work – Aryan supremacists, white supremacists, black supremacists, blue supremacists- especially the blue supremacists, they’ll never work, because if you get the same people from the same genetic group to all intermarry, hello? Cousins marrying, hello?? IQ down the toilet! Hitler was trying this’ first generation of Nazis would have been, “Sieg Heil!” Second generation, “Sieg Heil…” Third generation, “Er… Sieg… er… I’ve no idea.”
The FBI picked up a guy who was trying to access anthrax through the mail. Who the fuck do you write to for anthrax?! Is there a big desk, with people going, “More requests for anthrax? Thank you, Jeff.”
( mimes typing ) “Dear Mrs. Stevens, thank you for your request for anthrax, one of the most dangerous chemical weapons known to humankind. We have pleasure in rushing you three buckets of anthrax for your own personal use only…” But this guy was doing it fraudulently, he must have been a bit cunning. ( mimes typing again ) “Dear Sir, my name is Daisy, I am a cow. I wish to take my own life, so please send me three buckets of anthrax, as anthrax is designed to kill cattle and I want to end it all right now. P.S.: I cannot shoot myself as I have no opposable thumbs.”
Pedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are proof of this experiment. Pedigree dogs are all inbred, you take the grandmother and the great-nephew,( mimes forcing copulation ) “There you go…” And they’re all next to each other in the genetic pool, so they look kinda good, but they just go, “Er… woof…”
“And what do you think about the latest doggie situation?”
“Er… w-woof… I like meeting other dogs.”
Whereas the mongrel dog with a black patch over a white face, furry on top and sleek down below because a lion shagged a whippet… that’s the one! That’s the one that goes on and nicks your credit cards and drives to the Bahamas!

15. Puberty
But I'm going to finish up today by talking about puberty! Which is a, kind of spiky subject, but it's interesting, because there's things like these kids that started shooting people, which you've had in America. Because guns don't kill people, it's just that certain noise they make. It's just a bullet ripping through peoples' bodies. That's what kills people! Yeah, have guns but don't allow any ammunition. There! We got it! We got it sorted! And they just go ( mimes throwing gun in frustration ) So, yeah.
But puberty was… well, before puberty, at school, I didn't tell kids I was a transvestite ‘cause I thought they might kill me with sticks, you know?
""Why?""
""I don't know, he said a word we didn't understand. And he won at Scrabble with it.""
So, yes. So most transvestites fancy girls, and you can tell people this.
""Yes, most transvestites fancy girls.""
""Well who told you that?""
""A transvestite told me that!""
""Probably lives in a cave somewhere.""
""No, an executive transvestite did!”
""Oh, really? Well… fantastico.""
So, yeah. So I played kiss-chase with the girls - tag a girl, she has to kiss you, kinda sexy. But then puberty came! Puberty came and destroyed my confidence, destroyed my everything! Which, I think, is part of the thing that causes these kids to go off and commit murder, essentially, ‘cause it is such a hell of a gear change. Think about it! ‘Cause before puberty, girls and boys are going, ""Girls! ( disgusted noise )!"" ""Boys! ( disgusted noise )"" Then it gets to puberty, and instead they're going, ""Girls! Oh…"" or, you know, ""Boys, boys,"" whatever sexual preference you're going, but you just start switching on, sort of… ( interested noises ). And you think, ""God, I want to get off with some of these people, I better look my best."" And then Mother Nature says, ""No, you will look the worst you've ever looked in your life!"" ( raspberry mimicking explosion ) ""Hold on, where did I get all this from? Jesus! It's ( disgusted noises ). We repulse ourselves! I mean, I used to look in the mirror and go, ""Well, I'm not going to shag me, that's for certain!"" ‘Cause that's what narcissism is all about, is looking in the mirror and going, ""God, I'd like to have sex with myself!"" You know? It's all sort of self-attraction thing. And then, when you're at the acne thing, you just go, ""Uh-uh, no way!""
And parents should tell you the facts of puberty! ""Look, your hair's going to go greasy, your face will become a general plague area... Here's a book on the Black Death... Tufts of hair will grow on your chin, not in a sexy stubble way, but in a continuing plague theme. Down here, I'm not going to even talk about that! But here's a picture of your Uncle Jim... ( getting scared and turning picture around alternately ) Sorry, it’s the other way up... No, that's your aunt, sorry... That's Queen Victoria."" And it's over months and years, isn't it. Puberty's over months and years. It should be one day, get the fucker over with! Go into school, ( squeakily ) “Sorry I'm late, I don't know why I was late."" By the time you get home, ( gruffly ) ""Right, I'm going home to get a job with a drill."" And that one day at school will be, ( swinging from high to low ) ""Sorry, I don't know the answer to that question, I don't... 'Scuse me, can I be excused? I seem to have the plague...""
And then I had to chat up girls and I had never used my vocal ability to chat up girls, and when your voice is breaking it's very hard! It's going, ( silkily ) ""Why, Susan, I really kind of ( squeakily ) fancy you. ( low voice ) I saw you in the ( squeaky ) playground."" I had to chat up girls and I'd only tagged them before and I didn't have the verbal power to be able to say, ""Susan, I saw you in the classroom today. As the sun came from behind the clouds, a burst of brilliant light caught your hair, it was haloed in front of me. You turned, your eyes flashed fire into my soul, I immediately read the words of Dostoyevsky and Karl Marx, and in the words of Albert Schweitzer, 'I fancy you.' "" But no. At 13, you're just going, "" 'ello, Sue. I've got legs. Do you like bread? I've got a French loaf. ( smacking sound ) Bye! I love you!""
So it was all not working very well. And later on, when we become more mature, we have that line, where if you're talking to someone, getting on well, you can say that great line, ""Do you want a cup of coffee?"" And if they go, ""Ah… yeah, okay,"" then sex is on, yeah? That's the unwritten rule. Doesn't always work. If the President of Burundi says, ""Would you like a cup of coffee,"" you're not supposed to go, ""Oh, I'm in here!""
""And how do you take it?""
""Anywhere I can find it big boy! Oh, just a cup of coffee? All right... I thought you meant 'Do you want a cup of coffee!' So you're from Burundi, are you? Fantastic! Yeah! No, I know, it's near Zaire, isn't it? Near Tanzania, yeah. Yeah. No, I learned them all when I had chicken pox. I have to go now, ‘cause my grandmother's on fire...""
But normally it does work as long as you keep the chat sexy. ""Yes, I like my coffee hot and strong. Like I like my women! Hot and strong... With a spoon in them. Ah, the curve of the spoon, the curve of your breast! I like to run the spoon ( talking with the tongue sticking out ) across my lips..."" Then you're pretty close, yeah?

16. Splashy Splashy
And I was a very driven Boy Scout. Very driven Boy Scout! Driven everywhere I was, and... ( chuckles ) This is such a crap joke! Other nights I've never even said it ‘cause I thought, ""It’s so crap..."" I'm just laughing that you laughed. Anyway. But I was a driven Boy Scout. No, I was actually just driven. You know, I was just a… forget this. Anyway, so... Yeah, I had all the badges! I had all the badges, I had my sort of “Landing on the Moon” badge! You know, advanced badges. My “Nuclear Fusion” badge, and my “Menachem Beguin Disguise Kit” badge, which was great, and so I was a top scout! I was a chief scout, had my own tribe and everything, and me and this other guy who was a chief scout, we went on an outing as sort of chaperones for these girls who were slightly younger than us. So it was 10 girls, two boys - pretty good odds for a shy kid. We went to an activity center, where you climb a tree and eat a sausage and it's kind of… It builds your character so you know about sausages. And we end up in a swimming pool, and I'm doing splashy splashy with this girl I really fancy. And she's doing splashy splashy back and I'm going, ""Fucking ‘ell, splashy back!"" You know, ‘cause splashy splashy is the aquatic equivalent of ""Do you want a cup of coffee?"" Right? So splashy splashy's going well and I suddenly think, “I know! I'll turn around, I'll do swimmy swimmy, and then maybe she'll do swimmy swimmy too in a kind of chase me-chase me way and then we'd do catchy catchy and underwater sexy sexy!” But I was so elated that splashy splashy was actually working that I just swam like a boy chased by sharky-sharky! I swam, and I swam and I swam, and I was in Egypt when they caught up to me! And that's a long way from England. ‘cause it goes England, Venezuela, Beirut, Africa, Cincinnati, Hanging Gardens of Babylon... It's near Switzerland. So, yeah, it was just… it wasn't working.
And I was saving my virginity! You know, it's cool to lose your virginity at 13. Yeah, say, ""Yeah, I was 13, she was 25, you know... Yeah... I was an animal! What can I say?"" But I was saving my virginity for a woman made out of breasts! And I was getting on! I was 18 and they were going,
""Have you done it? Have you done it yet?""
""Uh, I'm not from your country.""
Go on to college, you know, still nothing, and I thought, ""Stop saving yourself for some imaginary person who just isn't there! Just lose your virginity! Just find anyone, anyone, as long as they've got a pulse. Or not! Pulse optional!"" And I was 21 before I lost my virginity. 21! That's not cool at all, is it? But then I tell everyone about it, so that's quite cool. And I've done it since then.( counts with his fingers )
But the weirdest thing of all was I actually lost my virginity a year before I lost my virginity. Yeah … weird! A year before, when I was 20, I actually had a night of whey-hey-hey-hey! So the next morning it was one of those post-virginity breakfasts, I was thinking, you know. ""Hey, just sit there. ( singing ) Breakfast cereal, bacon and eggs. Bit of coffee bubbling away. Freshly squeezed mango juice!"" She's going, ""You're very chipper this morning."" I'm going,
""Yeah, yeah, fucking ‘ell! Yeah! ‘cause last night, ( chuckles, then sings ) lost my virginity!""
""Oh yeah, with who?""
( moving head from left to right ) I did this for an hour, and I was going, ""With you! With you! What the fuck ( clucks incoherently ) What the fuck was last night all about?!"" You know, and she said, ""No!"" And we had this conversation, and the words ejaculation came into the conversation, and the world 'premature' as well. And I came back with, ""No, ejaculation - mature, mature ejaculation. Not premature, post-mature, veteran ejaculation! Wise, learned man ejaculation! Mature man who does the washing up-type ejaculation..."" But she said, ""No!"" She vetoed it! She was China in the United Nations Security Council… in the United Nations Security Council Of My Virginity. And so it just didn't work! It was… fucked me off, I tell you. But she's dead now, so... No, she isn't... No, she was in L.A., in a car, with Engelbert Humperdinck, and...

17. Bilingual Encore
So that's the end of my show, and I do like to end the show with a kind of ""Oh"" feeling, and I think I've done that quite well. But thank you very much for being here. I hope you've enjoyed it. Yeah... N
( Eddie comes back and plays with a clapping audience for about 30 seconds )
What?
Now I just wanna talk quickly about language, and then we can all go. Yeah, language. They do say Britain and America are two countries separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and it’s true. No, they say, “two countries separated by a common language,” that’s the line; it’s an Oscar Wilde line, I think. And we do pronounce things in a different way, like you say “caterpillar” and we say “caterpillar,” and… You say “aluminum” and we say “aluminium.” You say, “centrifugal” and we say “centrifugal.” You say, “leisure” and we say “lizuray.” You say “baysil” and we say “bahsil.” You say “’erbs” and we say “herbs,” because there’s a fucking “H” in it… But you spell through THRU, and I’m with you on that, ‘cause we spell it “THRUFF,” and that’s trying to cheat at Scrabble.
“How can we get that “OU” sound?”
“Well, a “U” will work,”
“What about an “O” as well?”
“We don’t need it, we’re fine.”
“No, I think an “O” in.”
“Well, all right.”
“And a “G” as well.”
“What?!”
“Yes, a “G” would be good. We need a silent “G” in the background, in case of any accidents or something.”
“Well, all right.”
“And an “H” as well.”
“Fucking ‘ell! Hang on.”
“An “H” in case some herbs come along.”
“All right…”
“And a Q, and a P, and a Z… Look it’s a word in Scrabble that’s 480 points!”
So yes, and we do have slight differences in that arena, but in Europe we have 200 languages. 200 languages! Just count them, I know you won’t! And future generations of Europeans – I’m sorry, Europeans, but we’re gonna have to be bilingual; we’re gonna have to be, and English speakers hate this!
“Two languages in one head? No one can live at that speed! Good Lord, man! You’re asking the impossible!”
“But the Dutch speak four languages and smoke marijuana…”
“Yes, but they’re cheating! Everyone knows marijuana is a drug enhancement that can help you on track and field to come last in a team of 8 million other runners… who are all dead.”
I don’t know how the Dutch do it, but anyway, we’re gonna have to learn, and the reason for doing it is, one, for being groovy and just getting out there and doing it, but the second is we just lose a lot of business in the rest of Europe, ‘cause German people phone up…
“Wir haben fünf millionen Deutschmark…”
“Just fuck off, will you, mate?” ( hangs up )
“He was speaking German, I told him to go away, I told him to fuck off..! I don’t know, something about fünf million in Deutschmarks. I told him to get knotted! We don’t want any of his deutschy markys… We do? We do want that? Oh, I’m terribly sorry! Oh, fuck! Redial…”
So yeah, I’m into this, I’m into this idea; it’s a positive thing, man. I took my last show, “Glorious,” to Paris and I did it in French, and the French people came and stared at me, with that look in their eyes of “quoi?” Because, you know, there’s no standup in France, and they’re not used to English people speaking French, but I was doing it as a positive thing, because we could be the biggest melting pot in the world! 500 million people, all we have to do is melt a bit, just move it around… Fucking move it around! It was partly that and partly to just go, “yeah…” ( mocking sounds ) So I did that.
And I learnt French at school, up to the age of 16, and then I just kept talking it endlessly after that. And at school, the first page I ever learnt in French was full of things that are quite difficult to get into conversation, thinks like “the mouse is underneath the table” – la souris est en dessous la table. Just slip that when you’re buying a ticket to Paris: “Le train à Paris, oui? C’est ici? C’est maintenant? Cinq minutes… la souris est en dessous la table…”
The other line was, “the cat is on the chair” – le chat est sur la chaise – slightly more easy to fit in; and “the monkey is on the branch” – “le singe est sur la branche.” Very difficult to get into a conversation! Not a lot of jungle in France… monkeys thin on the ground… thin in the air… just generally pretty trim!
And yes, so it just wasn’t working. We go to bars and cafés, that’s where we go; we go to bars and cafés, and we sit there and we have chats in the café.
“Oui, j’aime beaucoup le cafê, le cafê noir and très fort; très choud… ( inhales ) avec une cuillère dedans… ( mocking sound ) Ah, le virage de la cuillère; le virage des poitrines… Je mets la cuillère dans la bouche…”
“Je suis le Président de Burundi!”
Ah, oui, Burundi! Je le connais bien! C’est tout près de Zaire, oui? Tout près de Mozambique… No, Tanzanie, Tanzanie! ( chuckles falsely ) Oui, je les ai appris quand j’ai les pox de poulet. Je dois part maintenant parce que ma grandmère est flambèe…”
If you don’t speak French, by the way, all that was fucking funny, all right? We go and get hotel rooms for the night:
“Vous avez une chambre, monsieur?”
“Oui, nous avons les chambres, nous sommes un hôtel!”
“OK, je voudrais une chambre avec un grand lit…” – a large bed – “avec une vue de la mer…” – a view of the sea – “avec une douche… with a spider.”
“Oui, monsieur… c’est chambre 42, monsieur.” “42? Merci beaucoup. Mais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est sur la branche.”
“Quois?”
“Il y a un singe sur la branche? Le chat? La souris?”
“Ou est le singe?”
“Le singe est sur la branche.”
“Est-ce que le singe est dans la chambre?”
In the end, the only way I could get that line into a conversation was I had to go to France with a cat, a mouse, a monkey, a table and a chair, and wander around heavily wooded areas. “Come on, come on! Someone’s coming, someone’s coming! Quick, positions! Les positions, maintenant! Boulot, boulot! Tout de suite! Vas-y! Vas-y!
“Bonjour!”
“Eh, bonjour. Qu’est-ce qui se passe?”
“Bonjour, je suis Anglais, je suis ici en vacances. C’est très belle ici, les couleurs, les bois, très belle.”
( inhaling ) “Tu est un travesti?”
“Oui, je suis un travesti, mais pas un travesti typical. Je suis un travesti executive… Un travesti d’action!”
“Très bien…”
“Mais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est… est… le singe est disparu.”
Cause the monkey would fuck off! He’d do his own thing. He was a bloody monkey! He was a cheeky monkey… and he knew my French wasn’t very good, so he’d go off and do things.
“Ah, le singe… maintenant… regarde. Il est sur une bicyclette. Il joue au banjo. Et il fume une pipe. Maintenant, il arrête… Il lit un journal, il a on journal…
Et maintenant il est dans l’autobus! Il conduit l’autobus! Et Sandra Bullock est dans l’autobus! Il y a une bombe dans l’autobus! Il faut conduire l’autobus plus de 50 kilomètres par l’heure. Et Keanu Reeves! Là! Il arrive dans la voiture! Il a pas de cheveuxet Jeff Daniels est déjà mort… Regarde, il se jette dans l’autobus. Et Dennis Hopper, oh! Dennis Hopper, quel méchant!”
That was the film “Speed” in French, which in France was called “La Vitesse!” Or at least it should have been, but in fact it was called “Speed.” Yeah…

18. In Conclusion
So in conclusion, ladies and jellyspoons… America, you have the American Dream, you have the American Dream! We haven’t got the European Dream yet, that’s what we’ve got to get; we’ve got to get a dream to build on. You have the American Dream; the dream is to be born in the gutter, and raise, and grow up and get all the money in the world and stick it in your ears and go ( blows raspberry ) The American Dream! A fantastic dream of money in your ears and swimming through fivers. The American Dream!
In Europe… I don’t know, we haven’t got a dream yet. Well, the dream was… ( mimics sleeping and dreaming ) “Oh… get off, you fuckin’…! Flag. No!” ( wakes up with a gasp )
“Hilda, Hilda, wake up, Hilda!”
“What is it, Dr. Heimlich, you waking-up type person?”
“I’ve dreamed the European Dream. I dreamt that every country in Europe spoke a different language and they hated each other… Oh, that’s true, isn’t it? Yes.”
That was the dream, but now, maybe now, the dream is to be in the South of Europe – to be in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, and to be on a moped with no helmet on, riding along, going, “ciao!”
That’s a pretty cool dream; it’s not much of a dream, but it’s as good as we’ve got so far, and it’s pretty funky, ‘cause when you die… you look a mess, but I don’t know, I just like it. ( mimics riding on a Vespa ) ‘Cause you’re in a fucking hairdryer. There’s dogs walking faster than you! It’s just pretty damn cool for me. That’s the European Dream, thank you very much.

Now this is time for free your mind and your soul
Yo, half the story has never been told
Ladies, you got to demand what you want
And what we want is respect, right?
Yo, listen up on the track here so I can feel if it rides
Freedom everytime for the sisters
Check this, watch this

[Verse 1: Queen Latifah]
Now here we go now...
Listen, if, um, pum pum ruled, I'd be the ruler like Slick Rick
Get with this quick witted Adidas wearing chick
Papa got a brand new bag, Mama got a brand new Jag
A gold tag, I ain't no old hag
I represent not only in the kitchen and the bedroom
But also in the boardroom so give me more room
Deny my opportunity, you in jeopardy
Yo yo, set me free, don't hinder me, let me be

[Verse 2: Yo-Yo]
I'm fightin' for freedom, I got the heat in case you need
I'm a straight soldier, ain't nobody told ya?
Hold up on them lies, I know your games and your plans
Do whatever you can to oppress The Man
But when it's time to drop the bomb bring the funkiness on
You say you never met a sister so strong, you're wrong
Now how can we be free?
It takes you and it takes me to live together in harmony
And peace and love and all of the above
Sisters comin' together representing one love
No disrespect, but we gotta get it together
No matter what's the weather, sisters gotta stick together
And sisters be strong, don't let 'em steer you wrong, hold on
Cause sisters got it goin' on, yeah

Free your mind and your soul
Don't let no guys come take control
Because you're young gonna get played the roll

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Whoever said these are the things that you can do
And the things you ain't supposed to?
So am I further when I think I'm getting closer?
That's when I tend to think of Rosa
How Rosa took a seat to make a stand
But now, in standing, we've gotten more demanding
They never thought of planning
That a wish for us to sit would be a dose of
This fucking rollercoaster
Whether tradition or religion, why you question my decision?
Why you spend up all your time trying to get into my mind?
Why everybody and they mama
Gots to add to all my drama, mad drama
Hell if I'm gonna keep my dominating, feministic
Hell-creating CrazySexyCool, Black ass
In the palms of your player-hater's stance
My only chance of being free is to fly within me
And it's illegal to kill a fuckin' eagle
A bird is never more important than my people
I guess we didn't need him so I took away his freedom

My spiritual awareness leads me to believe
That you're doubting the sisters to come with the peace
We've been together since Jah created water
The African border, celebration is in order
Pop the cork and give champagne to the stork
That brought the Lyte to my Mama in New York
African I come again and again
You kick me down, I get back up
I'm comin back in multiples of 10

[Verse 5: Nefertiti]
You know where I come from
Slung from the belly of the beast
Used to speak African tongue
So I showed her, next one rolled her
Slung the devil over my shoulder
I'm gettin' over 'cuz I'm bolder than the next
I'm enlightening because I speak the real truth from the text
Who's next to flex with this S-I-S-T-E-R?

Come and take a walk with me
Closer walk with thee, see what only I can see
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen
So it's back to the womb of everlasting life and truth
Let the heaven of a sister embrace you
And praise some other gods
Come into the light, let it shine, Blackness is fine
The Blackness of your skin, the Blackness of your mind

I am who I am and that's who I be
And I don't give a damn if your eyes can't see
If you can't see what I can see
That you're blind, baby, by a woman who's Black
So back up, back up 'cause it's on
I'm-a tell ya strong what's wrong
With the world that we're living on
It ain't who ya know, it ain't what ya drive
It's about how you feel about yourself on the inside
When your self-esteem is low

But that ain't what the Lord God made you to be

Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, ""A guarantee""
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus 1]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

I give you my fortune

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not

Grab your clothes and get gone (Get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (Come on)

Where you deposit Young Money
And, and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the boss
And live from the vault, is Busta Buss

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Swag mania, pop that goes most, carry the most
Beautiful bitches with us happily toast
Keep the faculty close, gross when we give them a dose
Got them OD-ing, leaning in each Coast
Scenery froze, take notes, rock Rolls, diamonds that fit us
Chanel minks in the winter, who fucking with us?
We coming to give them the shivers, watery flows spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Uhh, shit
Please don't throw up, hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we gon' show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball so what's cracking with y'all?

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Native New Yorker, the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter, stepping like British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, just see how we do it
Get them into it steadily, God I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it!

I want to thank You, Heavenly Father

Ay, ay, I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
For shining Your light on me
And you listening to Q-Tip

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making it though
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done, rip up your paper 'cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff?
Beat him in the head, boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""Stop killing me, wolf""
Whop, beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse, he don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit we sinners, when me and Abstract together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers
Dammit we winners, pillar of this rap shit, homie they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow and then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

[Verse 6: Q-Tip]
Incredibly we do it and it resonates the music, iTune it, YouTube it
It could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas, bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners, blatant nonbelievers and overachievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas, drink Alizé liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal because me and Bus, we're prone to handle
We're gentlemen

[Verse 7: Busta Rhymes]
Not to mention, we're veterans, second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas but then again
You need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless, it's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons, see how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left

My man Billy hit me up, he got some weed he bringin' through
Tell him better be that good and grab a pack of Swishers too
That's what usually happens, deserve some cool relaxin'
Smokin' herb and laughin' at Curb Your Enthusiasm
I'm just a regular kid, at my crib
Doin' regular shit, burnin' 5 spliffs
I'm so high, another night alone
So I'm a pour another cup and roll another zone
I'm gone, you ain't gonna bring me back
So gone, couldn't tell you where I'm at
Maybe New York, Philly, maybe Pittsburgh
You wanna find me, hit me on Twitter
Wow, that sound mad lame
People love me, they don't even know my last name
Waitin' at the station till it's time that I can board the train
Headin' to the fortune fame, should explore my brain
See what I'm thinkin bout
Pour a little liquor then I drink it down

That I can get my pay, I just need to get it straight

No more bullshit, no more relaxin'

Burn out all the lights in

259,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

So I can fly away, until the end of time

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'

So take these broken wings

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

263,Big Poppa/Warning,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

264,Strong Enough,"[Verse 1]
I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing you can say or do for me
And I don't want a miracle
You'll never change for no one
And I hear your reasons why
Where did you sleep last night?
And was she worth it, was she worth it?

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go
There's no more to say
So save your breath and walk away
No matter what I hear you say
I'm strong enough to know you gotta go

[Verse 2]
So you feel misunderstood
Baby have I got news for you
On being used, I could write the book
But you don't wanna hear about it
'Cause I've been losing sleep
And you've been going cheap
She ain't worth half of me, it's true
Now I'm telling you, that

I'm strong enough to live without you
Strong enough and I quit crying
Long enough, now I'm strong enough
To know you gotta go

You'll never see me cry

Now I'm strong enough to live without you

[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And dreadlocks that at  night he liked to twirl
And he says:
""I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?

And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
""Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia I miss your rose tatoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn alot from Lydia)

[Verse 3:]
Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says ""How far do you want to go?""
He says ""How far is to Moreau?""
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things i miss

Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day

You're out there with winners, it's good to be king

Can I help it if I still dream time to time

It's good to be king and have your own world

I've been waiting for this moment secretly
Counting every minute
Every hour till you're with me
'Cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door

[Verse 1:]
Why waste another minute
Ooh, let's get right to it
Baby turn the lights down
And we don't have to say a word

Unspoken pleasure
There's no way to measure
How you make me feel
When you're near me and whisper softly
So don't stop

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
And it seems time flies
Whenever I'm in your arms
I like to savor every second
You thrill me with your charm

Now I'm lost in the passion
(Moment, feelings, magic) we share
And when I look into your eyes
I know how much you care

Don't wanna rush the feeling
'Cause loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood
With a little wine and candlelight

It's more than emotion
Let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love
(Now we're drifting into love)
Sweet surrender is so tender

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ooh, you know me oh so well
You always take your time
And you always get it right
(You know just what I like)

Ooh, you set my soul on fire
And I know you've got my rhythm
Cause then you take me higher

I'd rather be here with you baby, forever
My heart belongs to you 'cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true when we're together

I've played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying goodbye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true

You don't know that you're hurting me 'cause it's not just a sexual thang
I want to share my dreams, baby together

My heart's still in need to hold back on my love
But when you get close, I just want you to know
I start to get weak I can't let you go

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you

277,Craziest,"Verse 1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumbling
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling to mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not with Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of weed
With a chain representing penitentiaries
From Roman town to Bordentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
Lifers, Rikers to Folsom
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening too slow
I'm abrupting construction a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin behind an obstruction or turning something of nothing from
Poor shit to more shit as I rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking to hump Ms. Junk in the Trunk, pump pump me up

Chorus:

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

Verse 2: Vin Rock

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust, you call yourself callin my bluff, enough's enough - I'm puttin it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
My skills. Niggas I been rockin since lee twillz
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme Shrinkin
The sleepin MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lest a man should ever challenge the clan
With thirteen years experience of rippin mics put in our hands

Chorus:

Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest

Verse 3: Treach

I got barbarians to bogard me in
At a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it
I'm hittin Jermaine in Atlanta cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets

278,If You Love Me,"[Verse 1]
I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it

[Verse 2]
You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

[Bridge]
You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine, in the light and the dark

[Chorus]
If you love me, say it
If you trust me, do it
If you want me, show it
If you need me, prove it
If you love me, say it

279,Everlasting Love,"[Verse 1]
You became mine in the strangest time
On my life
'Cause baby I, I wasn't right
I was losing the fight and my mind

[Chorus]
I will not stand in the way of what we could become
I know that there's still a way to everlasting love

[Verse 2]
I, I'll do what I say
No matter what demons I face
I won't listen, ah-ah-ah-ah
'Cause you, you keep me sane
Out of this lonely frame of a mind

[Chorus]
I will not stand in the way of what we could become
I know that there's still a way to everlasting love
I will not stand in the way of what we could become
I know that there's still a way to everlasting love

[Bridge]
I hope it don't take us to long now
But I'd try for a thousand years if that's what it takes to get somewhere we want
I hope it don't take us too long now
But I'd risk forever just to make it right
And to feed our desires to hold on

[Chorus]

280,Tell Me When,"(French Montana)
Chorus:

I'm ready to go man I been ready to go (lalalalalala)
Smoking out the zipper slipping on my grind
See a nigga slipping stoned out my mind
Tell me when to go
Did it all before
Man I ain't scared to die
Just tell me when to gooooo

(French Montana)
Talking:

Just tell me when to go mane
We all got to go sometimes
They say a real nigga pick his time to go
Lets get into it

(French Montana)
First Verse:

I ain't scared to die just tell me when
Seen it all and done it all then did it twice again
Nothing is a accident its karma
You can forget your bitch but not your vest and your armor
Bitches say I dog them and kick them out my heart cold
Baby see my daddy was a pimp I was tought so
Crossroads bone thugs
New niggas always show you more love
Than your old niggas
Counting money close the doors up
Cleaning pistols paranoid
Keep a 100 for my lawyers
In the stash box
Do it for the have nots
My nigga caught 75 and got a better spirit then a broke nigga out here running around chilling
Montana

Chorus

(Cheese)
Talking:
Haha, lalala nigga, ready to go nigga,a zip, you know that,stoned nigga,rock what up

(cheese)
Verse 2:

Its cheese me and a bitch is something you can't keep together
Mozzarella going beast mode for that cheddar
Sour blunts juice and gin
Where Im from its about who last so fuck whos winning
The game dangerous once you get a snitch involved
Get your workers got
If you pimp then get your bitches robbed
You can't beat em I show loyalty
Likes letting your pits starve nigga then you feed em
I I I be speeding
They can't see him
I Bronx Park 95 or major deegan
Shout out to them dead prezies
I meet em then greet em
Right hand on the chest I pledge of allegiance
Im ready to go my loui duffle full
Got my blunt already rolled now im heading out the door
Hard work and grind im ready to show
C4 cheese that nigga ready to gooooooooooooooo

Chorus

(Charlie Rock)
Verse 3:

I thank God I woke up this morning
Ain't choose the game I was born in
Like my bitches like my cars all foreign
These niggas is fly then im soaring
When it come to the beef im all for it
Empty out the heat come back reload it
Cus they getting it to if they saw it
So when the jakes ask questions no court
Say im living life faster then big gordy
Can't stay away from the game im like jordan

You've gone a million miles
How far would you get
To that place where you can't remember

She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile

Where everything you want
Where everything you need

Shit. Word. I bust that nigga ass right now
Ain’t no–none of them niggas can’t fuck with me
What? Nigga you could never fuck with me, my nigga
I’ll fuck you up right now! What?! What?! What?!
Bust your motherfucking ass boy!
I ain't no motherfucking joke, you know who you talking to?

Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what I’m sayin'?
I fuck you up right now
Yeah! What?! What?! What?!

[Verse]
I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
I drop science like girls be dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
A-son, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit: CH-CH-BLAOW!
Last seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget: niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Nigga wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing - yo fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will r-iz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hardrock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back

But when I'm there I'm broke

And chase you all around your room
And the memories sail round like a ghost
And dance around in a sad slow tune, ah

""Quik, you're not a gangster, we're not""

[Intro]
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 1]
Now I'm bout to take it back to '84, when I was 14
Kickin' back in the Trees, Westside if you please
And 436 West Spruce was the spot
With me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock
Donzelle, if you with me, just let that shit kick
If your head ain't spinning from dippin' all them sticks
'Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming ""Órale ese"" with them laces on that Caddy
And you couldn't deny a hit from that Buddah Thai
Going 'round and 'round the driveway, now it's coming my way
And I'm zoned out, at a young age
And the whole Spruce Street was my stage
Peep, now back then I was in the 8th grade steady
But niggas my age was getting paid already
Yeah, like that nigga Zap, or even young Blue
They made they first million by the age of 22
Like Dan from Cedar block, him and little Motor
James from Piru Street with them boulders
Rest in peace little Noopy, he didn't have to brag
Rollin to the 10th grade in a fin-O rag
Well Goddamn, how can I be down?
I asked my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around
Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself
While they kickback and just collect the wealth
And now I'm thinking...
Ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis
T-shirt dingy, Pro Wings tacky
This could be a way for me to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned
Right then is when I learned that...

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you

But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Peep, I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact
So instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack
Now she jump in the rig and said 'I'll be right back'
When she came in she put me down with a plastic sack
I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit
I'm keepin' my rocks in the house and not in my pocket
Sister Jackie's in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda, fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders
Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks
Donzelly dippin' sticks, went and bought him a 6
And 500 block Peach running thangs ya see
Moving gallon after gallon and ki after ki
I'm telling you I done seen it all
From niggas hitting the sherm and then they pass out on the wall
From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let their panties fall
Teeth rotten, hair gone, and whole checks get blown
But yet I'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam
Safety pin splitting rocks to the, um, tic toc
I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Tacchini
While my rocks are disappearing like the great Houdini
I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equipment
And getting something new with each and every shipment
Money gets made and money gets spent
And how these jealous niggas acting only makes it evident that...

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

[Verse 3]
Check it, now in 1988 I moved away to L.A
My niggas Playa Hamm and Gina gave me a place to stay
On my way up from bottom rock
Bitches starting to jock
'Cause my hair is getting longer
And game's getting stronger
To pull my own weight, I went and got me a job
But by then, Hamm and Gina really started to squab
About whether I should go or stay
She told him 'Either he goes or you go'
We both was on our way
So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning
Clowning with players all around me just astounding
My nigga Pimpin' Carl got us staring with that hair and
Rolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren
Shabby Bleu feathered as he swerved
In the El Co, P7's park away from the curb
Big Jam, L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicky on the bike
That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed
And hoes just come and go, in and out
Revolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth
I'm making a living off of pimpin' so you fools can't trip
'Cause even though I love God, I also love my grip

[Chorus]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
'Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
You know that money's still good to you
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
'Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
You know that money's got you safe and sound

290,What Mattered Most,"[Verse 1]
I thought I knew the girl so well
If she was sad I couldn't tell
I missed the point, I missed the signs
So if she's gone the fault is mine
I know, I know a whole lot of little things
And even though I confess them one by one
She would still be gone

[Chorus]
Her eyes are blue, her hair is long
In '64 she was born in Baton Rouge
Her favorite song is ""In My Life""
I memorized her every move
I knew her books, her car, her cloths
But I paid no attention to what mattered most

[Verse 2]
I never asked, she never said
And when she cried I turned my head
She dreamed her dreams behind closed doors
That made them easy to ignore
And I know, I know I missed the forest for the trees
And all I have to show oh when she walked out the door
The cold facts and nothing more

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Her eyes are blue, her hair is long
In 64 she was born in Baton Rouge
Her father's tall, her mother's gone
She moved out west when she was two
The way she laughed, the way she loved

Walking laps around the yard with my Walkman bumpin' this
Now I'm bouts to get married, is it clever?
Thought it was 'til I got the Dear John letter
Been down for ten months and got a eight-year stay
And I just found out she had her baby yesterday
Ain't nobody been to see me yet, but I ain't gonna worry

We can still party like it’s your birthday
We can still party hard in your birthday suit
Knock that pussy out the park like my name Babe Ruth
Shawty she just want a tip, I just want to see her strip
If you fuck me like you love me shawty you might get rich
Have her own cake, her own place
Blow her own gas, no Rolaid
When we in the bed she like to roleplay
Tell her friend to join in both ways

[Chorus: Usher]
Shawty, I don’t mind
If you dance on a pole, that don’t make you a ho
Shawty, I don’t mind
When you work until three, if you’re leaving with me
Go make that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
'Cause I know how it is, go and handle your biz
And get that money, money, money
Your money, money, money
You can take off your clothes, long as you coming home
Girl, I don’t mind",Usher,1995,"[99, 95]",2
299,On Bended Knee,"[Verse 1]
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go

It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?

306,Get Down,"[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get, get, get down!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the '70s
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned while he asked me
""What you up to? The cops gon' bust you.""
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered if God sent him
'Cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us; I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin' my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls showin'
They little cooch; gangstas don't die, he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, 'cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, ""Nobody leavin'
Everybody—""

[Chorus: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
Get, get, get, get, get, get, get down!

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in their ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas who dangerous so don't test 'em
They make you disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of their car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto her-on blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck? I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangsters, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas, I got your back, the fools don't play.""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho
Responsible; the nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See, my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and thangs
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do with all the drama
'Cause I was with a crew that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded ""cool,"" but told me out here this how motherfuckers—

And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

Cause you don't think I know what you've done

I know I'm not the only one

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day, class started 2 hours ago
Oh am I late? No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, Uh, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

Uh huh, yeah
One two, one two
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""
Smokin' up blunts
Mad Dog 2020
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya""

[Verse 1]
I grab the forty, rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the wood works
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keith Murray gets busy off of Basic Instinct
I puff an L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin' stick-up
As God as my witness, with the sickness of a cannibalist cannabis
I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience with hallucinogenics either
I float strictly with the cannabis sativa
As my speech falls deeper than the scriptures
And graphic opponents, just like Picasso paintin' pictures
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cause

""I get lifted""
Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up, fire up this funk if ya have to""

Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up this funk, fire up this funk""

[Verse 2]
This the real deal, not a publicity stunt
I gets high like if the man in the Moon be puffing blunts
But verily, barely, merrily, is it dope or the dream?
Step into my chamber of intravenous smokescreen
I captivate it then motivate it, jealous of my desire
Smoke it down to the fire, anything to get a little higher
Hop in to college, but to be truthfully frank
Weed is knowledge, cause it makes me think
I pick anatomy and hem reality like Jah
Rastas read the bible, after puffin sensimillia
And the Sensi it gets me as a fly
I ain't bullshittin', you can ask Bill Clinton, he can verify that

Yeah, like that y'all

Roll a Philly and get, roll a Ziggy and get
""Fire up this funk, fire up this funk""

[Verse 3]
Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot, but first take me by the weed spot
I do this for my niggas locked down runnin' capers
Smokin herb, in the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire
And kyant pass de dutchie pon de left hand side
What the fuck? Who the fuck wanna fuck with the six shot shooter?
I murder you over buddha
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus-pocus
So kid, pass that bomb trom, word bond
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks

Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized to the funky sound 'cause

I wish that it could be
Just like before
I know I could've given you
So much more
Even though you know
I've given you all my love
I miss your smile, I miss your kiss
Each and everyday I reminisce
'coz baby it's you
That i'm always dreaming of
Repeat refrain & chorus

Bridge:
Letting love go is never easy
But I love you so
That's why I set you free
I know someday, somehow
I'll find a way
To leave it all behind me
I Guess it wasn't meant to be
But baby
Before I let you go
I want to say I love you
I hope that you're listenin'
'coz it's true, baby, oh yeah
You'll be forever in my heart
And I know that no one else will do
So before I let you go
I want to say...
So before I let you go
I want to say ""i love you""",Freestyle (Philippines),1995,"[50, 46, 39, 33, 30, 24, 21, 16, 15, 12, 9, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7]",16
322,Mad Izm,"[Intro: KRS-One]
Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin' this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic, yeahhh
Come on!

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

[Verse 1: KRS]
The episode starts when I walk down the block, kid
Reach in my pocket, yo where's my knot, it
Follows me into the spot, compellin'
Go check the dread and yes he's herb sellin'
A punani gate, I'm a potential felon
Izm is smellin', like I ain't even tellin'
Channel one two, I'm smashin' the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie 'cause I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

[Verse 2: Hakim]
Wake up in the mornin' got the yearnin' for herb
Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kickin'
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the pickin'
So listen to the izm as it talks non-stop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin' but so is the chocolate Thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin' fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

[Verse 3: KRS]
I'm comin' out to dance with da spliff of sensei 
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-Z-M'n
I start grinnin', and syllables start bendin'
My style is intangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes round it's on Capitol
That's what I'm smackin' you with cause it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Rippin' the microphone 'til I'm motherfuckin' sixty
Smokin' the indo, by the window, it's sticky

[Verse 4: Tuffy]
Come spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter? To decipher, the skills that I'm bringin'
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cause there's all these weak rappers steady makin' hits, FUCK THAT!
But '94, I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doin' what I want to do and sparkin' mad izm

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

[Verse 5: Tuffy]
I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(Yo yo yo yo-yo, pass that lighter)
Counterclockwise, I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shootin' out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit?

[Verse 6: KRS]
His shit is counterfeit cause he's motherfuckin' phony
Come into the jam, try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin'
Bumpin', '94 ain't for no frontin'
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Roughneck hip-hop is drippin' from the single
Now, let me introduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Goin' through the channels of the remote control
Flickin' through the frequencies of your soul

[Verse 7: Hakim]
Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cause hip-hop's been running through my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow. Why? Cause I'm drainin' em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doin' what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissin' wack MC's and sparking up mad izm

[Chorus]
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
Mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm
All we do is spark mad izm

323,People Don't Believe,"We got this whole motherfucker on a mission
Now the whole, entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they callin' on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me

Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you tryin' kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups

And we were always considered evil
Now they tryin' to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Let's peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled

So why you criticize me for the shit that you see on your TV?
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

So now they tryin' separation
And sendin' black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tappin' into our conversation
Saying, the message that they give bring forth or premeditation

So David's got a silver mag while listenin' to Brad
David gets mad and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset 'cause I got one?

A tisket, a tasket, a nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, they wanna blame it on my occupation

If you don't dig me then, nigga, you can sue me
Because the shit that I be sayin' ain't worse than no western money
Don't blame me, blame your man, Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fuckin' with the void in pop
Or feel my hot rocks

Bang, bang, boom, boom, ping, ping, I'm the black
White boys gat a magazine and don't know how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad

Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house, nigga, Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?

You punk niggas make me sick
Suckin' on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start deuchin'

Houston is the place, I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
To the Reverend, Calvin Butts, gotta pair of nuts?

I started this gangsta shit in '86
Now you dissin' me for publicity
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree?
Who me?

I'm a G who like to scrap a lot
Down with Rap-A-Lot
And I can't stop, won't stop

So fuck, Bill and Hillary
Ice Cube, there ain't no killin' me
Ice Cube, Scarface
Droppin' on these sellin' out niggas, doing it like this

We're getting old now
But I don’t feel it
I say you're beautiful
And I still mean it
And I don't wanna know
What old age feels like
So promise me you won’t
Give up on this life

And we'll be busy tryin'
While the rest of them are dyin'

We'll be laughing, and
We can play forever, don't make me face the truth

I think it’s obvious
That we’ll stay happy
'Cause I’m the happiest
When you smile at me
And we won't end the same

I'll never walk away
Without you with me

And times are getting harder
But I'm nothing like my father

Promise me we’ll never grow up
I don't wanna fall out
I wanna make love

We're together, and
Happy ever after, don't make me face the truth

That I'm dying soon
That we're dying

[Bridge]
Don't say goodbye
(When did we get so old, so old, so old?)
We're so much older
All I want is one more life with you
When did we get so old?
Why'd you get so sick?
And how could you die?

[Chorus]
You promised me you'd never grow up
Now I have to let go
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' how
I won't say goodbye
You promised me you'd never grow up
But you fucking grew up
God, I miss you so much
And even when your heart gave out
I was thinkin' I'd
Love you 'til forever, and I can't face the truth

Comes creeping on so haunting every time

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, ""Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today""
Yeeyah, then I said, ""Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split""
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?""
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am

Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin' hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark, drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just a homie, mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over: street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a sore and a scab
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

[Chorus]
(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

[Verse 3]
Be like Elmer J. Fudd with the mansion and the yacht
Brand new Glock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons, nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin' astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the paper, roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit
I'm ready, get the keys for the Jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copacetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an Uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt
You know what I want!

I would like to get to know if I could be
The kind of girl you that you could be down for
Cuz when I look at you I feel something tell me
That you're the kind of guy that I should make a move on
And if I don't let you know
Then I won't be for real
I could be wrong but I feel like something could be going on
The more I see you the more that it becomes so true
There ain't no other for me it's only you

I know anybody's gonna be lonely
Without the reason they got someone to care for
Maybe all you need's a shoulder to cry on
If that's a fact than I'll be more than you ever could dream of
If all you need is the time that I got plenty of
I'll dedicate all my love until you call baby
I wanna stay by your side
Be there to call you up
And let you know everything will be all right

[Verse 1: Digga D]
Bro put a box in draws, 35s and scores
Phone man if you want that
Don't talk like you're bad, you ain't on that
Combat, juice gon' spill like Cognac
Whip that shit, don’t stop 'til I lock that
Heard there's a mash on sale, man cop that
Verbal abuse is long, akh, stop that
Back out the mash and drop that, shot that
If you want Buju, man got that
Ban and TT smash it and dot that, chop that
Countryside; where the gwops at
Jump in pics, you ain't bro, man, crop that
No whip, then pedal bike risk it, he flipped it
Back out my shank and dip it, ballistic
Push in my shank and twist it
Pebs in cling; that’s Oreo biscuits
Man's machine coming with lead
Misch and mash for the bread
This grey ting's way too fast
Bitch, pull up your drawers; I only want head
Man put dick down in her neck-neck
Bore tongue, that's the best
Ejaculate in her mouth, or pull out, ejaculate on her breast

[Verse 2: Sav'O]
In the field, I'm Air Force stepping
More time I just smashed out packs in the ends
Right now I'm tryna get this bread in
Get 'round there and ching man up
Like anything B get wetted
No face, no case and leathers
Four door whip with serious members
My bro wanna lurk on opps
So we go round there on a 125
Bro done whacked man's face with the longest blade
Tryna take man's eye
I heard that the opp boys ran with their shanks again
And I weren't surprised
Creepz Sav ain't on piss
He raps that shit and he ran ten times
Packs on me, Rambz on me
Push bike hitting them shoots
Peng gyal on man from the B
Feeling me and MSkum, too
My bros ain't down for the stunting
Digga D grab that dots and shoot
Us man ain't like them man
Them man lie and we tell the truth
Gang
Like, free all my bros, soon touch road
How many times have I rid on Bush?
Like one of them boy gotta go
Back out my ting and make man swim
Like ching man down on volts
Catch me a opp then stab up his head
Then ten toes back to the Grove
Then ten toes back to the Grove

[Verse 3: T.Y]
Friend of a opp is a opp
So I won't feel a way to go burn that bridge
My nigga Huncho gave him twenty-two chings
I can bet you that he's feeling pissed
Get 'round there Samurai's and flicks
JSav put his whole Rambz in your wig
My bro Digga D had the whole HR locked off
When he crossed that bridge
If I get my hands on a opp
I ain't wetting him once; I'm wetting him numerous times
See a opp right there
Tell bro don't jerk the car
Just keep it moving in line, ay
Four and a half, got bags of ball and dust
Man slap it in tens
If I back my splash, he don't back it up
No leg shots; man put it in chests
Like, bros got a thing for dargs
Teefing cats I ain't talking no pets
Bruck down a nine in flake
And whip it in Zs
Let it dry then put it in pebs
Cats dem call for the meds

TT flake, twenty-three on a two-ie
Jakes just passed, hope they don't do a U-ie
OT, I don't like doing deals like Louie
Bad B like boujee, upsuh with two G's, like Gucci
Pour kettle water on it, watch it start bubbling
Straight drop, I ain't doubling
Use your chest, stop mumbling
Bro, I'm booky
I'll take your food if my belly starts rumbling
They rap about bootings, they ain't blammed nobody
Hold that properly when I bang that dotty
I put sniff in a 'rex, and I slang that Bobby
TT make it bling, always answering my hottie
Left my worker in the trap
While I flew to the town on pedal bike
Just to sweep some more cats
They ain't seeing no racks
I'm in and out of the trap
I left the door on the latch
When I add it up, take a oner off with the shorts
I'm a 0-1-1 but most of them are noughts
Fuck jail; fuck Jakes; fuck courts
Drilla got twelve cah he turned something corpse, crasses
What's all the hate for?
Is it 'cause I'm making dough?
That hate only push me to make more
I smash b, whip coke, smoke loud
Whip a Z, twenty six back, no doubt

[Verse 2: T.Y]
Feds know my face from the days when I sold buj'
Comfy in my ends and I got beef in my own hood
In the trap, left cracks on the floor like Hulk would
Gyalie said she like me 'cause I'm sweet and I'm so hood
Hospital, nose full of tubes
Got yourself shanked up cah your bros wanna screw
MSkum in the back, that's a problem for these yutes
Ten toes, what? Where? Don't get run out of your shoes
I get busy on my own, I get busy on the roads
Keep on braggin' 'bout them Z's, 'til I clean out your home
Gotta keep my face down cah Sini's kinda known
Cah my hood's like a jungle, no Indiana Jones
Me and F was in the trap, you was busy getting plaits
When your bro got touched, did you even chip in for a strap?
When I hopped off the ped, they did a one-hundred-metre track
If Huncho never stabbed it, then it's probably my nigga, Dappz

He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
Cuz I's a bit 2 leisurely
It seems that I was busy doin' something close 2 nothin'
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her
She walked in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind U find in a second hand store
Raspberry beret
And if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more
Raspberry beret
I think I love her

Guess I shoulda known by the way U parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See, U're the kinda person that believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
Guess I must be dumb, she had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night, I guess that makes it all right
And U say - ""What have I got 2 lose?""
And honey, I said little red Corvette

This is it
Time for U 2 go 2 the wire
U will hit
Cuz U got the burnin' desire

I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love

[Verse 2]
You saw a brand new high
Thought that you could fly
Did I hear you cry
Or did you like the ride?

You call my name again
No, it's not a sin
I'll show you how to win
And where I've been

[Hook]
I want your love
I want it tonight
I'm taking your heart
So don't you fight

I'll be your answer
I'll be your wish
I'll be your fantasy
Your favorite dish

[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love

[Bridge]
You'll never have to run away
You'll always have a friend to play
You'll never go out on your own
In me
You will find a home
Home

[Chorus]
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end
100% pure love
From the back to the middle
And around again
I'm gonna be there till the end

I know I vowed to never do this again, but, uh
I guess this seems to be the only thing I'm good at
Got something that you need to know
Be the realest shit I never wrote
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note
Yeah, yeah, listen baby

[Verse 1]
Let me start by saying that the way I feel for you has never once changed
And the games I played, mistakes I made leave me sorrier than you'll ever know
We got a problem, baby, I can't lie
'Cause lately, I realize that I
Never knew that we was on the same (playing field)
Knew that it was wrong, but we (let it be)
And I know you never knew when you said I do
That you would have to face all the (pain you feel)

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Verse 2]
Trade memories for moments, trade love to be lonely
Guess that's just the man in me, blame it on celebrity
When the night time feel like the right time
And that spotlight feel like the right light
When it's really just my fears and I still don't dry your tears
When I say, ""She ain't you and I really love you more""
And you say, ""If it's true, why you do it for?""
And I, I really don't have no excuse
I break your heart, make you cry, I just wanna say goodbye

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Bridge]
What I feel, I don't even gotta write it
It's like poison in my body and there's no way to deny
That my heart is a time bomb with seconds left to explode
But I gotta let you know before it blows
That it ain't on you, it's my fault
All the gossip and talk, behind your back when you walk
By the time you will know, before long you will see
That you deserve more, you deserve more
You deserve so much more than what I'm offering

[Chorus]
And it's killing me, girl, that you have to live with this
Live with the lies I tell, live with the pain you feel
Knowing the man you love is fooling around
Oh baby, said it's killing me, girl
Said I just don't understand why you wanna be with this kind of man, oh oh
Why would you love a fool with all the things I do?
I know it's hard for you, hard for you to live with this

[Outro]
Live with this
Can you live with this, girl?
I just want you know
Got something that you need to know
This be the realest shit I never wrote, uh
Can't hold it, gotta let it go
Know that I mean every note, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, umm umm",Usher,1995,"[96, 88, 83, 72, 68, 54, 53, 40, 38, 41, 42, 43, 43]",13
343,"Whiney, Whiney (From ""Dumb And Dumber"")","[Round 1: Dizaster]
You guys know what rhymes with ‘I should’ve been the king in the first place?’
Spittin’ in Eurgh’s face
Congratulations Pat, you turned us into holy believers
You retrieved the item and came back from war
With bullet holes in your t-shirt
If life was like football
This faggot would catch a bullet for me like an open receiver
But you didn’t have to go and do research
I gave you a dead body you owe this to team work
So no matter how you look at it you’re not my opponent
I’m more like your leader
So I told Pat, ‘Stay! Now go fetch it for me like a fuckin’ Golden Retriever’
I mean I gave you a dead body
Before the battle started it was already done
Anybody could’ve beat Cane that day
Mr. Conspiracy could of walked on to the stage and farted on him and won
But when you first meet Pat he actually seems cool ‘til you catch him at the club
Drunk as fuck tellin’ Jamaican dudes how much he loves African people huh
He’s a racist, you can’t escape it, your actions are see-through
You’re destined, being Anglo-Saxon is in your family gene pool
You shoot ‘roids in your ass through the same package and needles
Hollohan used on his back when he tatted the Eagle
Ain’t no way on Earth this match up is equal
My thought process will completely collapse ya cerebral
Dizaster is evil like havin’ a Catholic Cathedral attached to the back of a Preschool
‘Yo I’m the man for the throne, the champ gotta go
His name’s Pat cause he Stay’s in the back of his home
Cause he’s afraid if he leaves he’ll get attacked by Charron
Attacked by Charron, attacked by Charron’
Man if I said you were scared of the dude
Then it would be an understatement
My bad I almost pushed you, he probably would’ve punched my face in
The same way he tells people at the club
How he’ll get drunk and crush their frame in
Until Charron walks up and he tucks his chain in
Why you even wearin’ that shit? Ah, you’re not even wearin’ that shit
Since you’ve had it, no one has even seen you with it on
No one has seen you at all, zero appearances for King Of The Dot
Man you didn’t even have the decency in you to give us an at least three minute blog
Fuck it, he doesn’t talk to his fans on Twitter cause he thinks
Well, on Twitter he’s too G to be on
But a real man is a real man no matter what social media he’s on
See these people are drawn to you cause they think that you strong
But they don’t know you’re an insecure little bitch
Who sees their comments, keeps readin’ along cause he’s such an introverted child he won’t even respond
See we thought you were a Golden Retriever, we’re wrong
You’re just a little seeing eye dog
And we were blind to the fact you were leadin’ us on
But this is the part, I called him Golden Retriever
Cause when I said retrieve it was immediately gone
So I speak to him like he’s my dog
It’s only right I’m the king and I put it in his ear like Cesar Millan
Listen here you cocksucker
I called you out in 2010 and back then you were a lot younger
You were like a brand new phone, no contact on you so I called you up
You didn’t show up like a blocked number
Now you in the eye of the storm, witness that raw thunder
I’m using the site as your grave as motivation to make up for lost hunger
I do a drive by and your godmother hop out of a crop duster
With 11 Arabic dudes armed with box cutters
Fuck around and make me have to pass the Tommy Gun to Marv's brother
And you better hope it d-d-d-d-does not stutter
I pop suckers
Ya homie on the block tryin’ to be the number one block stunner
He try to floss then he’ll get laser beamed for those flashy glasses
If the faggot acts like Scott Summers
You and your bitch can die and you’ll make the news like Tom Tucker
Let me teach you how to actual do a scheme
I’ll show up to Alexander Keith's Factory Brewery, packing an automatic tool with me
Rasputin clashed with Musolini clappin’ an Uzi at everythin’ that randomly moves
‘Til I turn the avenue into a Los Santos shootin’ spree
I’m Franklin with a Kalashnikov at your family eulogy
Open fire like Campo Delgado on the Halifax community
You could be a bear, cat, lion, rhino, Pat that would be cool with me
Cause when I rap I act as if I’m pullin’ an act of animal cruelty
Watch Lassie get neutered and then hand me my jewelry
Yeah, I’m a twisted Arab, being a psychopath isn’t new to me
I move like an Android, I’m an animal fused between
A catalyst while passin’ it through the genes
I’m not even an actual human being
I’m a walkin’ Hannibal movie scene
My thoughts form like Inception, walls around me
Collapse while I’m strapped to a huge machine
Rapidly maneuver rooms full of changin’ gravity
Telepathically movin’ things makin’ the ground crack beneath me
Like Leonardo DiCaprio trapped in a lucid dream
And a fact to you it seems
I been known to knock whiteheads out like acne removal cream
If it wasn’t for this battle with you and me
No one would give a fuck about you like Cassidy’s new CD
And people who should’ve watched my battles online either
They could pass away from actually viewin’ me
Sit alone in you livin’ room, lights go out
Then I flash your computer screen
You see static then die a week later
Like what happens when you view The Ring
That’s how you do the scheme
Yeah, fuck around, yeah get rid of that gangsta vibe
You ain’t from the dark side of the Dartmouth you’re from the safer side
Where the neighbors are always waving hi
And when you walk away they even say ‘Goodbye’
Since you out scale me in weight and size
I’m someone you’re not afraid to try, but that’s fake shit, why?
When you were nice with Math like an Asian guy
Yeah, I battled Arsonal and violated his space like 180 times
But when you battled him you kept complainin’ and walkin’ away
Like this is a waste of time
Funny how he’s from Grape but he stomped you and made you wine (whine)
Like a little bitch, you’re known to run away from fights
You never throw the scrap down
Goin’ through the security at the airport is the only time you ever see Pat down
And this the end, so just go off and deny it
Threatened to us all you’ll retire and just go do a blog of you cryin’
You have the body size of Goliath but what good is havin’ body size
If you don’t have the heart of a lion
Even though I'm taller than him, he’ll always be smaller than I am
This is like Wrestlemania 1, watchin’ Hulk Hogan beat the fuck out of Andre The Giant

[Round 1: Pat Stay]
I fell right into his trap ya’ll, he got me, I admit it
As you can tell I agreed to do long ass rounds and I don’t know why I did it
So I hope ya’ll did ya’ll stretches today cause it might be a wise decision
We’ll probably have full-grown beards by the time we’re finished
Ain’t no thing to me, I just feel bad for the crowd
Could be at home watchin’ a damn movie relaxin’ right now
By the time he gets into through about half his round
You’ll be in the part in Titanic where DiCaprio drowns
Wait, wait, I know that’s not exactly how he died
Just figured I’d save us some time and state that
Cause if I didn’t he would of rebuttaled it like
‘Actually he froze pussy, and his name's Jack’
Aye but this is just a spar, a scrimmage
From start to finish I'ma make it hard to live with
Like a heart condition for this narcissistic mark this
Isn’t a smart decision I kick it hard as
Mixed martial artists, twist his arm ‘til it’s hard to fix him
Like a car when the part is missin’
When you start the engine with the spark ignition, here’s a parkin’ ticket
Mark a target, I marked my target, I’m a marksman
Sharp precision, an artist with the lead, Charles Dickens
Pick ‘em from the furthest distance, it’s hard to miss ‘em
Who startin’ shit? You ain’t startin’ shit, you ain’t sparkin’ shit
You wouldn’t spark my interest
Get your bitch involved, I even target women
When I bust this cap it’ll let her/letter like how you start a sentence
Capital letter, start a sentence, suck a dick
I’m on a whole other level, a stone to a pebble
Sell my soul to the devil, I’m a rebel
This Nova Scotia no coma toast if I throw a blow in December
He’ll be gone ‘til November
See that tough guy shit won’t work on me dawg, they don’t buy it man
Like hair that’s all over hair you lyin’ man
Please test me, you’ll get these fists of fury ‘til my hands tired
Light you up under the chin like a story by the campfire
Aye, remember when we was in Sweden and you slapped buddy?
Ya’ll gotta hear this story, shit was mad funny
Yeah yeah, you got your scuffle threw your little slap
Made a big old dramatic scene then said, ‘Pat get my back’
I stood beside him and had his back, shit I still do
But I ain’t lyin’ that shit you pulled outside was real smooth
The lil’ dude told him, ‘Well let’s take this around the corner on the right’
He pulled this one, ‘Fuck you, fuck them.’
Translation, ‘I don’t wanna fight.’
The cops show up from all the commotion he caused
Cause he was too scared to fight dude
And The Saurus I hate to bring you up in this bro cause I like you
But they start talkin’ to cops like, ‘He pushed this girl, he did this, he did that’
Where I’m from that makes you a couple fuckin’ squealin’ rats
We don’t talk to police, especially when you start the fight
I’m a different breed dawg, you just a bitch who got more bark than bite
And if I am a Golden Retriever it’s only cause people believed your lies
So I am a seeing eye dog cause I’m here to lead the blind
So slap me, I’d smack your little fuckin’ mouth off
Bitch I’ll punch you so damn hard, muthafucker I’ll drop
I busted a dudes skull with a fuckin’ hundred pound rock
The noises he made from the brain damage was sickenin’
Then the sound stopped
I let my emotions get the best of me, sometimes I think I’m emotionless
I just stood over my homies open casket crackin’ jokes and shit
Laughing, pokin’ ‘em
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe it’s how I cope with it
But what’s weird is I cried ‘til the tears smeared my rhymes for ‘em when I wrote the shit
But whatever you do never confuse emotional with weak
I’ll slit ya throat with tears rollin’ down my cheek
Try to make a joke out of me you better leave both eyes open when you sleep
And somethin’ close enough to reach
Cause the last six months of my life I been fucked bro
You think I’m worried about rap?
The next tear that rolls down my face might turn into a permanent tat
You’re a fuckin’ fake spoiled rich suburban brat
When you spray Febreze you probably turn it like this and squirt it like that
And you know what’s somethin’ weird about you that I never understood?
Why do you lie and try to deny that you got it good?
As if you’re ashamed and that it’s cooler to be from the hood
You got it fucked up dawg, oh I get it
You just tryin’ to fit in with the homies right?
In your backyard with your gangster friends bettin’ on pony fights
Your own friends said it
You went from a backpacker to Juggalo to raver to angry gangster
Probably got a picture of Project Pat as your fuckin’ screensaver
Must be nice when you have no bills and Drake’s your neighbor
But that’s some shit I’m gon’ save for later
Time!

[Round 2: Dizaster]
You’re right, I do have Project Pat as my screensaver
That’s still way better than havin’ a Charron lookin’ teenager
This muthafuckers always tryin’ to put his hand on his leg
Charron’s a dope emcee he should get a battle with you without havin’ to beg
Next time you wanna extend a hand out to him
Why don’t your faggot ass just give him a battle instead?
What happened with you and Jeff? I’ll tell you
He had an agreement with him, yeah this cat is a fraud
You had an agreement with him not to spit that
But you switched back on your promise with him and you went back on it all
You had a big pact with him not have no bitch-ass-ness involved
And you said, ‘Please, come on Jeff, no personal bars
We don’t wanna bring up the past and the things that we saw.""
And he agreed cause he didn’t wanna take advantage of it all
And you only did that durin’ his biggest match
Where you can catch him off guard
Cause you weren’t man enough to address the topic
When the big cameras are off
That shit was so bad even Mike Vick called up Calicoe like
‘Yo I can’t believe he did that to his dawg’
You learned a lot from Jeff, he helped your bitch ass evolve
And you evolved into a Scientologist
Absorbed all the knowledge you were fathered with
And used it to spit back at God
Turned your back on him, left him in the middle of a massive brawl
Six months passed couldn’t even give him back a call
Cause all the juicin’ in the gym his nuts started to shrink back they're so small
He’s walkin’ around Scotia with a bag of Tic Tacs for some balls
Jeff should’ve smacked the piss out of you
Like he did to Step Easy when they were in the bathroom stall
I seen it happen all, sniff that cause it’s raw
Raw like the impact of a fist against a big cats grill when his chin cracks
As a result of being the biggest dude where he lives at
So he’s never been in a real scrap at all
I bet if I tipped ya head over, ya big ass would fall
Just a big fat Neanderthal
You ain’t about action, you haven’t been tradin’ your jab in
Cause you been too busy chasin’ the dragon
Like Goku when didn’t have the Balls
I’m serious, listen up Patrick Wah
These kids come out the side of their neck
They’re gettin’ their shit snap like Benoit
Yeah serious shit Pat, you want ripped abs?
I could give you a 24-hour fitness membership to a gym class tomorrow
But I’d rather get rid of ya skin fat when I go across ya six pack
With a retractable claw so the next time you have a Big Mac
Your big bitch ass will have to sip that through a straw
You dumb fuck, tried to rebuttal the Golden Retriever shit
But when I called you Golden Retriever
You should’ve taken it as a compliment
Cause all Golden Retriever dogs
Were blessed with the logic and the common sense
Not to betray the friend that they’re bonded with
You’re not a Golden Retriever you’re more like a dishonest Pit
A half-breed, a mutt, that was probably mixed
And the only doggy tricks it was taught was this
And that’s backstabbin’ a person in the back it was brought up with
Eat a doggy dick, eat a fuckin’ doggy dick
Fuck a body bag, I’ll put you in a doggy bag and mop your shit
Talk about I’m the rat when his best friend shit gets real
That’s how the pig will squeal
Jeff told him
‘Are you sure you’re not gonna mention anything in this battle Pat?’
He told him, Trust me, lips are sealed.""
That’s why this rat should fry, he’s a rapper from Scotia
Of course he’ll bring up stuff that’s classified
Who’s had your back more than Jeff out of all of these battle guys?
Exactly, you can’t reply and that is why Pat should die
Cause you killed your only dog like the screenwriters from Family Guy
And if you think about it, Jeff is a lot like Family Guy’s dog Brian
Cause he’s always barkin’ and cryin’ every time a black guys walks by him
I promised you I wouldn’t bring up shit in this battle
And I wouldn’t cross the line
But there’s a little thing that I wanted to talk about, that’s fine
Stop denying, I put this on my Mom’s life, I am not lyin’
You were at a show in Scotia
Got socked while you were on the stage on the spot rhymin’
You went outside, started wildin’
Fuck around and got punched and you took off flyin’
And left your little homie behind so he could get stomped by them
I swear to God all this stuff is true
His little fuckin’ homie got fucked up and sent to the hospital
If he would’ve died that night, you would’ve been responsible
You pulled a fuckin’ card and made your younger homie squab for you
He thought Pat would Stay but instead you walked away
And turned you back on him the same way you did to Arsonal
So stop tellin’ me you sucka free
When you don’t even believe it yourself
You’re big but you got the self-esteem of an elf
Time after time you leave your people behind
While they’re screamin’ for help
So when I seen you leave Arsonal alone in the ring spittin’ schemes by himself
All I could think of was, ""Damn, history has a strange way of repeatin’ itself!""
It’s over ya gone, ya dead broke, I know you don’t have a job
You’re back livin’ at home with your mom
Tell them Mr. Sucka Free, you don’t pay no rent now
I can’t believe I get to say this to somebody, this all makes sense now
Always talkin’ about some bullshit, that’s why he’s getting’ embarrassed
Sharin’ a therapist with, shut up bitch you live with your parents
Like you’re gonna clap whom?
He brushes his teeth every mornin’ and he comes out of his bathroom
With his mom standin’ right there at the door like
""Okay honey, here’s your vacuum.""
Trust me you’ve never been sucker free
I know for a fact your homies told me you were a paperboy ‘til you were 23
A paperboy, like a boss that’s not even part of your nature
How are you a boss when you don’t got any paper?
And if you do it’s cause you’re drivin’ by slow on your little retarded bike
And you’re about to toss it to your neighbors
A fuckin’ paperboy Pat that’s worse than office labor
Of course you don’t got no job
You’re back at home in you mama’s trailer bottled up all this anger
You’re an in-the-closet racist with black bodies hangin’ from his closet hanger
TV paused on Kramer so he can leave, come back and then watch it later
You claim you not a racist but both you squares got burned like a waffle maker
Do us all a favor, stop lookin’ like a fuckin’ Neo-Nazi Army Ranger
Because of you your homies life is in constant danger
You’re not a Saint, Patrick, you’re more like a fallen angel
You can’t call God your savior you're Judas at the Prophets traitor
Yeah, the Prophets Traitor
He exposed how you never been in a fight at all you faker
You’ve never seen contact like broads who get optic lasers
I’ll run a number on your hood like a sponsored racer
I’ll show up to your block take the white like a chalk eraser
I’m like a Boston strangler with the heart of a Toronto hockey player
In the ring I’m like Muhammad Ali crossed with Frazier
Sock you and knock out your jaw retainer
So hard it’ll drop you and your boxin’ trainer
And have him in the background lookin’ like a fuckin’ Harlem shaker
And I still didn’t use “Doppelganger,” “Martian Crater,” “Coffee Maker”
“Condom Flavor,” “Arbitrator,” “modulator”
Someone tell Bender, I’m sorry player

[Round 2: Pat Stay]
Ya’ll ready? That was dope, give it up
But wait, you got it fucked up
I’m not like you, I don’t live with my mom, faggot
And I wasn’t a paperboy, I don’t know what the fuck he’s sayin’
But wait let me guess
You got a bunch of photocopied copies of my paychecks?
That were sent through PayPal
Then you’re gonna start handing out all the statements?
I heard you sent a lot of dick pics to hoes online
Aye, I ain’t mad at you dawg, so do I
Difference is though when they click his they roll their eyes
Then open mine and have to use that lil’ scroll on the side
Straight up don’t leave your bitch with me for the night
I’m servin’ up a log dog I be feedin’ her right
All girth, his girl wanted to see what it’s like
She said it was out of this world, you know, a little meatier right?
Fuck I’m cool as shit, you need to relax, you’re too stiff let loose a bit
Drop your neck, roll your shoulders, start doin’ this
You're lookin’ like a goddamn lunatic
Remember how I beat Hollohan and schooled the kid?
Smooth and slick, make it look like the dude was pissed
Well I'ma use the same formula I used on him
And show you how my style’s his diffusal kit
Check it, see you wild but I got more style than you
I’m so nice my rap name should be “How Are You?”
So funky when I spit, every sec I sniff
Like check my kicks like I stepped in shit
If this a ball game, I’m Lebron James
Bow, from long range, all day
Yeah, the white Snoop Dogg’s back
Invade yo territory and moonwalk back, bitch
It’s so effortless, no pressure it’s nothin’ I don’t sweat the shit
Clothes fresh, Rolex, gold necklace
Sex machine battery sold separate
You got the fuckin’ swag of an old catchers mitt
And rap like you think we on the flo' wrestlin’
Cold steppin’ since ’07 been wreckin’ it, watch, I’m so dexterous
I flip flows just like this, yo check this shit
Murder for hire late night burglarizer
I creep the streets and old ladies grip their purses tighter
Mark McGwire with the bat, split your wig in half swing it so fast
I make fitted caps turn to visors
I blackout all I hear is screams and a churches choir
Walkin’ through a circle of burnin’ fire like a circus tiger
Tie ya to a furnace emerged in gas
Blast the thermostat ‘til the wires and the circuits fried
Slide a burnin’ match then turn it higher
You’re playin’ checkers on a chessboard
Planko with Connect Four
Your hype but it takes away from what you write it’s a double-edged sword
I’m versatility and it’s 100% pure form
I flip styles, missile, get down, see look what I just did now
This round I'ma just smack this bitch round
Like Chris Brown, like sit down
Like, who’s the Golden Retriever in this shit now?
Now watch this how, I spin round, back to that shit about Chris Brown
I make history on this stage
Big as hits to Rihanna’s face with a fist pound
I’m a brick house, with ya bitch whip my dick...out
She went like this...wow
I went like this she went like this...ouch
You get your bang on with the chain on huh? I second-guess it
He just talks out his ass like Ace Ventura: Pet Detective
You say you fucked Scarlett Pain? That couldn’t be less impressive
I’ll respect it when you fuck Rachel Starr or Alexis Texas
Yeah he was givin’ her that “Sexual Healing”
You know, “Expressin’ his feelings”
Yeah kissin’ all in the hoe’s mouth
When she just sucked Lexington Steele’s dick
Bet she didn’t feel shit
Why you don't date Lebanese girls like you, Bachir?
It’d be too competitive over who’d have the coolest beard
Your mom had so much pubic hair it’s her goddamn computer chair
And the men are all control freaks
Go shoppin’ for somethin’ new to wear
And won’t even let their wives leave the house unless they’re rockin’ fuck scuba gear
I went to hang at his place, his Pops said, ""Come in.""
Told his wife, ""Go make him a steak, don’t make a mistake.""
She said, ""What? Do I or do I not make him a steak?""
He said, ""Did I make a mistake?"" Kicked the bitch right in the face
Here’s the real question
Why do all your conversations sound like you’re yelling at each other?
How is GHAKAGHAKLAGHA telling her you love her?
You 12-different-colognes-at-once-smellin’ mutha fucker
How the hell can you tell which one smells better than the other?
Now wait, now I might’ve just fucked up my Lebanese connects back home but I don’t care
From now on if I wanna order a doner i’ll just use my neighbors phone and have it go there
And to end this off just to fuck up his flip so he can't rebuttal my shit
Diss my moonwalk right now if you ever sucked a guys dick Time!

[Round 3: Dizaster]
I thought you were sucka free
Why are you askin’ who fuckin’ dissed me? Stop tryin’ to be like me
You wanna fuckin’ diss Arabic people you fuckin’ worthless bitch?
You could suck a fuckin’ Persian dick
You wanna make up fuckin’ Arabic jokes you little worthless bitch?
You can suck a fuckin’ Persian dick
You’re such a fuckin’ racist, you ain’t even wearing the chain
Cause it’s not long enough to hang a black person with
That’s who you are cause you belong in the sewer with the rest of the rats
In a room with a plaque on the wall and a gold medal attached
That says, 'I exposed Jeff for his tats’
This guy, I learned he’s the real racist and I learned a lesson from that
Everything he said about Jeff in his past was only a reflection of Pat’s
See he’s just a white supremacist trash Methodist stash
Yelawolf has incredible tracks redneck with a mask
Who tucked in all of his confederate flag so he can get acceptance from blacks
How fuckin’ pathetic is that?
Like he fuckin’ dissed his boy for a fuckin’ bitch that he sexed in his past
But that’s probably from the same bitch Devenue smashed
I bet if you got an STD check up right now your test wouldn’t pass
Jeff might be the one with the genital rash
But you’re the one on deck with the crabs
So sex with your ass would’ve been her Deadliest Catch
And if I fuck on my bitch and you find out and it’s mentioned in your raps
You better not use your pen and tell her/Pen & Teller
Cause if you do I’ll put your head and legs in a cast and have ‘em severed in half
Bars, compare that to the shit he says when he raps
He attacks quicker than an African Serval Cat, wack
First of all it’s serval not sever-al, how pathetic is Pat?
And second of all if you’re gonna beat me you’re gonna need an animal better than that
Everybody knows that Pat’s cool
Until you see him and he goes to dap you
Extends his hand and then he’s like a ho and slaps you
Some shit that only fags do
He picks up his opponent mid battle and throws his ass
Licks his lips then he goes to grab you
Sticks his fingers in your ears then flicks your nose and then shoulder taps you
And he does that to damn near every opponent that he raps to
Unless he goes against a black dude
And you already known that the facts true
Shit they even felt bad for that line that they won’t react to
But we can tell you that you’ve become positive just like a Pastor at a holy chapel
If you just scroll back to the verses that you wrote for Matthew
He wants to be from America so bad, all the stuff’s true
He thinks he’s from the west coast, what a mark, he’s a dumb goof
He bumpin’ songs from Pac and Kurupt, Snoop
Mobbin’ down the block bustin’ his aerosol Glock from the sun roof
With Hollohan ridin’ shotgun smokin’ black tar through some random light bulb that they unscrewed
Dumb & Dumber ass clowns fuckin’ up the whole spot when they come through
They’ll never save Gotham
Havin’ ‘em both on the job is like havin’ two Robins in one group
You said you wouldn’t spit personal bars, I didn’t trust you
Cause that’s the Art Of War and I’m the one that taught him to Sun Tzu
So you can be Bruce Lee if you want to
Cause if you Bruce Lee then I’m Ip Man the guy that taught him his Kung Fu
The guy that taught him his Kung Fu
Be cautious I walk as God amongst you, you’re my apostle
I’ll sock you ‘til the words come off you like a crossword puzzle
Pop ya thought process bubble so hard you’ll see stars like Hubble
Which makes sense cause every time your squads in trouble
You take off like an Apollo shuttle
But that’s real life shit Pat, those are bars you cannot rebuttal
I bet if my animals ran through your house right now you would book it like Jumanji’s jungle
Always runnin’ away from fights, you already know it’s your thing
All remember from your Arsonal battles you try to run and take cover
Standin’ there for a fuckin’ hour saying, ""Pat Stay is a sucker, Pat Stay is a sucker.""
And I know y'all had two rounds and you weren’t prepared for another
But what made the thing worse is watchin’ two grown men in the ring that are scared of each other
See most rappers would make excuses
And duck out of battles on why they ain’t travelin’
But Pat’s worse than that
You’ll fuckin’ duck out of a battle while it’s actually happening
It’s not about a paper agreement Pat, it’s a manhood thing
You should never back down from someone who’s challengin’ your manhood
If it happens in a scrap you would swing
See rappers, we like boxers, it’s the same exact fuckin’ thing
As a champion there’s a level of command you have to have in the ring
You not a true champ if you can walk away and turn your back while a challenger swings
And that’s exactly why you don’t deserve to be Canada’s King
You had a bunch of funny shit, I spit real shit
What fans do you actually bring?
You don’t even have a champion’s legacy
Five judged battles in his whole career
He shouldn’t even be standin’ here next to me
Technically his rap sheet is blank, Canibus memory
Yeah, you have fans Pat
But you don’t know what it’s like to have any enemies
You don’t know what it’s like to balance the backstabbers and jealousy
And have to walk around in real life like it isn’t actually affecting me
That’s why I use this stage for these fans to connect with me
Show him who I am and that’s a man of integrity
You’re nice outside of battles but you always attack people so recklessly
But one day the nice guy gon’ come out the shadows eventually
And until then Fresco is more of a man than you’ll ever be
You don’t even have an identity
You’re just a big happy angry sad faggot
That doesn’t even make sense to me
You’re the only dude on the court with no balls
You’re a basketball referee
You have the swagger of Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was havin’ a pregnancy
Him and Patrick both are bi they like takin’ paddle boats and ride
That’s where they go and tan on the ocean side
That’s where Patrick opens wide and lets him splash his load inside
And that’s not being gay at all y'all that’s called having Scotian pride
You’re a murk, what a fuckin’ weirdo
Leavin’ all your people behind, just a little fuckin’ weeny
Ripped to make his limbs tear from his feet
Beat him with a fuckin’ big pair of cleats
He just a big scary freak with a Ric Flair physique
But you been scared of beef
Ever since you went there with Jeff and let shit air in the street
You hustled with him for too long to let him sit there and get beat
So what I’m tryin’ to say is you could’ve been there at least
Instead what you do?
Upload footage of you eatin’ a sandwich on your toilet as you sit there in ya seat
Which doesn’t surprise me anymore Pat cause you’ve been known to shit where you eat
Stop givin’ me that mean face, don’t be the next emcee that I cremate
Lay off the ecstasy, slam on your fuckin’ E brake
You haven’t improved at anythin’ since the Elements League
Just methamphetamines, I’m done messin’ with you fiends
A combination of multiple drug addicts
Living life through the eyes of one faggot like Requiem For A Dream
Stop fuckin’ distractin’ me, this shit is not what it seems
I’m fuckin’ up now, I have to end it with somethin’ crazy
Fuck it, I don’t know what to do, these people are talking during my shit
Fuckin’ it up, fuck
Catch a fuckin’ uppercut, your mother is a slut
Fuck I don’t never even done this before but I have to do it right now
I got Buddhist type wisdom
You’ll walk away from it all if it don’t make no sense
That’s Jewish guy syndrome
You try to run away, I lock you down with these 16’s like a juvenile prison
His crew decide to ride, then his crew can die with him
Get crucified with him, the only chances of you survivin’ are breathin’ through a tube like you were scuba divin’
And no one will be there to view you died like suicide victims
[unclear]…if I choose to fight with him, it’s like gettin’ Hadouken’d by Ryu and Ken, I’ll buddah ki kick him
And every move that I hit him
Will leave him with a pupil missin’ from his eye
Like students in school who try ditchin’
It’s not a movie script, when I leave this dude with blind vision
I’ll remove your eye quicker than Uma Thurman
When she killed the dude who tried switchin’
I will Kill Bill him and leave him with two of his eyes missin’
I hate this shit!

[Round 3: Pat Stay]
He said I had a Ric Flair physique...true
That’s why girls see me walk by they say, ""Woo!""
See he choked and pulled out his phone to see it
That was some pathetic shit
You just proved that you can only beat me with a phone on some Joe Pesci shit
Yo when I see you spinnin’ around and swingin’ around and runnin’ around curlin’ I’m thinkin’
""Damn, this guy must beat the shit out of his girlfriend.""
I mean damn boy, you like a Motorola phone cause you the first one to flip like you on M androids
Never stops movin’ is like something’s wrong with his nervous system
And he ruins every picture he’s in cause he’s always blurry in them
Like, why so serious?
We was supposed to battle in August but he moved it to the end of January
That’s how much of a queer he is
Clammy palms sweatin’ profusely and he just can’t stop
Every time you give the man props you gotta wipe your hand off
I seen him before the battle comin’ at me lookin’ all happy with his hand like this
I tried to avoid it and gave him the hammer fist and he gave me the trailer hitch
Aye I bet he’s the most intense person to ever play video games with
Eyebrows bouncin’ everywhere makin’ the most ridiculous faces
All into it bitin’ his lips lookin’ like a fuckin’ serial rapist
And his whole body turns with the controller when he steers when he’s racin’
Definite button masher and your controller he’s gettin’ carried away with
And he beats you every game cause you keep peekin’ away from the screen scared that he’ll break it
You don’t know how serious he takes it, you hit the sack now it’s only him
Tryin’ to sleep and all you hear is him on the headset like
""Cover me, I’m goin’ in.""
Aye wait, they said
""Pat you can’t beat him with jokes you gotta match this guys intensity""
I said, ""Why? What you mean how fast he rhymes and everything?
All that rapid fire delivery, how he act all wild and yell and scream?""
It just sounds cool, he got the crowd fool they’re just distracted by his energy
See Organik wasted paper on him, shouldn’t be promotin’ his ass
It’s not Fair Trade, cause lately everythin’ D composes is trash
Now I ain’t even gonna run that back
But did you find those kind of relatable? I’ll break it down quickly
His bio’s degradable
Bro, do you know what I’ve done for King Of The Dot?
You really think you’re more valuable than me?
You do? Do you understand the impact that me versus Hollohan had on this league?
Goin’ on about how much you care about the chain just beggin’ for people’s attention
But when we needed you the most, you treated it like a joke and couldn’t even defend it
But you know what?
There is a little bit of truth behind some of the shit Dizaster’s been sayin’
I have lost my love for this shit
Cause now it’s just oversaturated and fabricated
They ask you to make a blog before the battle
To make the match entertainin’ and act like you hate him
Then after the battle we’re laughin’ and hangin’
See that’s what I’m saying, it’s wack I hate it
You know from the microphones to the battles on stages
So now everyone can rap about guns now as long as the lines half creative
And this social media shit makes these battle rappers act like they’re famous, man I don’t know
I guess I’m just havin’ trouble tryin’ to adapt to the changes
I used Instagram maybe once in my life, never really used Twitter much
You tell me how many views you have I’ll probably tell you I don’t give a fuck
I don’t even watch battles these days I lost the interest
They used to make me feel like I had the globe in my palm just spinnin’ it on my index
But shit changes doesn’t it? Maybe I’m buggin’
One day I love it, next day I’m sayin’ fuck it
‘Til I step on stage, see the fans that crazy rush hits
And a little voice in my head whispers, ""Aye you got this.""
Look, see I don’t do this for the chain Diz, I do it for these guys
I do it for my fans who knew I was losin’ my passion but stayed by my side
I do this shit for the dude who wrote me and said my song about alcoholism saved his life
Cause just to know his role model survived the same struggle helped push him and gave him drive
I do this shit for the kid with cancer I used to talk to on the phone
Any day he could’ve died but he said the laughter and excitement he got from my battles and talkin’ to me every day just made him feel alive
Man I’ll never forget the day he called me and told me
His Doc said he’s been gettin’ better and his tumor had shrank in size
Then his mom’s told me she believes me being there for him helped him
And she thanked me crying, now that’s what the fuck I do this for dawg
You just crave the attention you’re like a little college girl
Congrats on your 70,000 Twitter followers Mr. Popular, who gives a fuck?
Who would you be if it wasn’t for this? Ask yourself
And you wouldn’t even be who you are if it wasn’t for mommy and daddy’s help
You see anyone could’ve been you Diz, just had to follow the manuscript
Stress free, rent free
Never had to pay a goddamn bill in his life cause his family’s rich
So while we were all bustin’ our asses to pay the bill
You know bein’ a grown man and shit
He had all those years of free time to write rhymes and practice his battle skills in his family’s crib
You see anyone here could’ve been you Diz
With the funds and proper management
So many opportunities the average man would just never have a chance to get
Like for example his battle with Canibus costed a fortune
How did he manage it?
Organik couldn’t come up with all of the funds
So Diz got his daddy to handle it

[Dizaster]
Bullshit. That's a fucking lie

[Pat Stay]
See anyone of us could’ve been you Diz
Anyone of us could’ve been you Diz
But none of us had these advantages
I mean come on, you were practically handed it
He just took the pass and he ran with it
But I would never wanna be you Diz
Cause if this whole thing magically vanishes
At least I could say that I actually landed this shit on my own
And go out as a champton who wasn’t handed shit
Look, he mad right now
Gonna wire some Western Union from his dad right now
Heads up, he’s bout to throw another beer in the crowd right now
And he was callin’ me a paperboy, I just gotta laugh right now
Cause they’re writin’ his obituary right now in the back right now
Aye and to end this battle off, you’re right
This title don’t really matter to me bro
If I lose tonight I’ll just get my freedom back and my album on the go
Battle who I want, when I want, traveling the globe
And you’ll be practicing at home for your battle with Charron
I almost planned to let him win, you were just my sacrificial goat
I was gonna fuck up on purpose and just act as if I choked
But I just couldn’t let my people down cause the fans is all I know
Ayo Canada!
Your champion is home
And since he was talkin’ about it so much
I guess I gotta address you Charron
I know you’re still mad that I molested you bro
And the whole battle community hasn’t left you alone
Ever since Arsonal showed that pic of me rubbin’ your leg on the couch
But you been dissin’ me for three years, it’s like you’re obsessed with me though
And I haven’t paid him any attention and that’s what affects him the most
Bro, don’t be delusional, I wasn’t duckin’ you, I was just lettin’ you grow
So once you finish potty trainin’ you can step to the throne",King of the Dot,1995,"[99, 93, 80, 71, 64, 64, 62, 70, 65, 67, 76]",11

348,What I Need,"[Verse 1: Kehlani]
All the back and forth getting complicated
Running me around got me frustrated, no
That's why I been laying low
If you wanna make it work, baby, gotta say it
Need a little more than participation
Or, I could go be on my own

[Pre-Chorus: Hayley Kiyoko]
Sure I would kiss you, I'll lay with you
You're broke, no, I can't fix you
I won't, no, I won't diss you
But babe, yeah, I might miss you
If you're cold and needed shelter
I'd hold you, but not sweat ya
And know we're not together
But babe, I won't forget ya

[Chorus: Kehlani & Hayley Kiyoko]
What I need, what I need, what I need
Is for you to be sure, no no no
For you to be sure, no no no
For you to be sure, no no no
What I need, what I need, what I need
Is to tell me that it's yours, no no no
And who you do it for, no no no
Need you to be sure, no no no, no no
Need you to be sure
Need you to be sure

[Verse 2: Hayley Kiyoko]
When we're all alone, girl, you wanna own it
When we're with your fam, you don't wanna show it
Oh, you try to keep us on the low
I only want a girl who ain't afraid to love me
Not a metaphor of what we really could be
Oh, I ain't putting on a show

[Pre-Chorus: Hayley Kiyoko]
Sure I would kiss you, I'll lay with you
You're broke, no, I can't fix you
I won't, no, I won't diss you
But babe, yeah, I might miss you
If you're cold and needed shelter
I'd hold you, but not sweat ya
And know we're not together
But babe, I won't forget ya

I would kiss you, I'll lay with you
You're broke, no, I can't fix you
I won't, no, I won't diss you

If you're cold and needed shelter
I'd hold you, but not sweat ya
And know we're not together
But babe, I won't forget ya

Co do skitu ooo,no to chyba nie
Pieprze krytyków ooo i ich gdybanie
Ty bez kitu ooo, bujasz przy tym banie
Flow do bitu co nie brzmi jak czytanie
Odrazu, odpowiem, na pierwsze pytanie;
To co siedzi w Twojej głowie nie obchodzi chyba mnie
W każdym wersie, masz od chuja mnie
Wkładam w to serce, więc Ty - odchujaj się
Tu wersy kleją, jak Twoja laska teraz nam do chuja ssie
Czemu ktoś tu ciągle mlaska ona mi do chuja ssie!
Moja Frozy's jak Mon'Amie i tak z nią w chuja tnę
Każdy mój ziom z gibonami tu po osiedlu, buja się
Więc wchodzę na bank w to,nawet jeżeli mną gardzą
I tak tu zrobię ten banknot
Siedzieli pomiędzy bogiem a prawdą, no to chyba tak dawno
Moi wrogowie chcą na mnie nałożyć embargo
Są zjednoczeni tak bardzo, łączy ich do mnie ta zazdrość
Nie da się dzielić przez zero tak łatwo
A ja wychodzę na miasto
Chodź wolałbym na prostą
W mordzie mi nieźle już zaschło
Bo wczoraj było za ostro

[Refren x2]
Zawsze chciałem utrzeć nosa tym krytykom
Taki zwykły chłopak Znikąd
I nie wiem czemu
I nie wiem jak to
Ale udało mi się to, tak łatwo

[Zwrotka 2: Żabson]
Dzisiaj są me narodziny, przestałem żyć już na niby
Już pozrywałem te dyby, powybijałem te szyby
Mówią ,że mogę być inny, przez to mam być winny im to coś
Mimo ,że jestem dziecinny no to nawijki mam wyższy poziom
Jesteście trochę naiwni, szukacie biblii, w tym co tworzą
Słuchaczom oczy zamydli liczy, że nigdy ich nie otworzą
Dla dobrych ludzi heee, pozdro wciąż
A dla tych chujowych, Ty weź przez okno skocz
Kiedyś Opoczno ziom, a teraz Kielce
Kiedyś nie znał nikt, teraz ludzi zna mnie więcej
Więc opinie wszelkie to normalne, mogą się różnić, minimalnie
Mnie to jebie, maksymalnie, supreme chce mnie, na okładkę
Supreme w cenie jest na zawsze, Ty wiesz jak jest -
Wkurwiam się gdy mnie krytykują; Kanye West
A więc rest in peace, hejter potem kwit pędze
Chce mieć go dziś w ręce kumasz? Chce zbić pęge
Czym prędzej wbić pętle, im kołek wbić w serce
Dziś ziomek ich zdepcze mam cydr w ręce i dym w bletce

352,All I Wanna Do,"[Intro]
Hit it!
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is LA!

[Verse 1]
""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die,""
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing
He says his name is William, but I'm sure
He's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy
And he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if
He's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash
The good people of the world are washing their cars
On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well, they're nothing like Billy and me, cause

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Verse 2]
I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack
Letting each one burn down to his thick fingers
Before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor
And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads, but

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard

[Bridge]
Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty
Cars
The sun and the moon but

[Chorus Variation]
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling the party's just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you that you're the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard",Sheryl Crow,1995,"[50, 48, 47, 39, 35, 31, 27, 25, 17, 18, 17]",11

How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough to know
When it's time
Time to let go
Sing

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I asked for a sign
From my sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me, but when
You think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

Oh, I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No, I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry

To these rules, will you abide?
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right?

But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah yeah yeah

Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way?
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time?

And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
(Said I wanna be, said I wanna be, said I wanna be)
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
(Said I wanna be happy if it's all right with you and me...)
All I really want (...it'll be all right with me)
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
(Won't you help me sing, just help me sing it)
It would be so sweet

Is to be happy

You're just a big freak, you better not complain
When you hear these cocktales and you hear your name
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine

If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm getting sucked in my drop-top Cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick-sucker, worked me and my homies
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vickie
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick

She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana'
I took her to my house and I told her ""strip""
Baby got freaky - started doing the splits
I said, ""Bee-yotch! Do what you want
Cause this true-blue mack won't even front""
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight it wouldn't give me none
I'm Too Short, baby, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one
I didn't fuck her freaky ass but it was still fun

I know you stop and wonder just what it is
It's the California lifestyle that I live
See I'm from the Crew, Dangerous, Bitch
I get on the mic and spit that freaky shit
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga, that's your bitch

I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy cause I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Every time she cross my mind I go fuck her again
She's like another bitch named Christina
Bitch so dumb, I named her ""misdemeanor""
Cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch
And go dig in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screaming I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder

Fucking MC's cause she's so nasty
See her backstage trying to throw that ass
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my vogues then I drop the bitch
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs
I know a bitch named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me

She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie
Angie called me up about 2 weeks later
Talking some shit about ""do me, player""
So I did her just like Tamara
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera
Next they told a bitch named Raquel
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was digging in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back, now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything, cause I came to pimp
I'm Too Short, baby, I don't stop macking
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rapping
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em up like that, bitch!

I know a bitch, her name was Sherry
I had to cut her loose cause she wanted to get married
Pussy so good and I do mean very
Sometimes it's shaved and sometimes it's hairy
I'm Short Dogg, ain't nothing nice
You ever make me mad and I'll fuck your wife
Have fun with your bitch and have her sprung on my dick
I guess I'll pull it out and just cum on your bitch

Like my other little tramp named Erica
Anywhere I want to fuck, that's where I fuck
Cause she's the freakiest bitch in America
And every time I get the pussy, I just tear it up

I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar!

Стреляю по Маглам
Я стреляю по Маглам
Я как Драко Малфой
Стреляю по Маглам
Ненавижу их стадо
Стреляю по Маглам
Они хотят услышать правду
Я ненавижу их стадо

[Куплет 1: Jessie Vatutin]
Плохой парень, как Драко Малфой
Ненавижу полукровок и Маглов
Их рэп это волшнебная шляпа
Она определяет их нахуй
В нашем жанре не мало
Этих ёбаных Маглов
Они хотят быть, как мы
И наваливать также
Я играю без правил
И мне плевать на время
Мой хип-хоп не умрет
Ведь я пожиратель смерти
Мы хотим тусоваться
Только с сильнейшими, знаешь
Мы должны быть командой
Против ебаных Маглов (Авада Кедавра)
Тусую на вписке -
Невменяемый белый парень
Я лучший в их списках
И мне всегда все рады
Раздутое эго
Раздутая печень
Бухло меня убьет
Но я пожиратель смерти

Стреляю по Маглам

[Куплет 2: WILDNIGHTS]
Я ненавижу твой район
Ведь он слаще чем сахар
Слаще чем запах бывшей суки
Та, что на фото с кем-то успешней, чем ты
От вас недостаточный вайб
От вас не получим мы кайф
Ты это знай, волшебная палочка - майк
Я кладу к себе в карманы кучу таблов
Я схавал их и стал мигом похож на мага
Твоя сука хотела к нам, хоть мы без бабок
Конечно, кто хочет тусить с ебаным Маглом?
С ебаным Маглом, с ебаным Маглом
Ведём себя нагло, ведём себя нагло
Пули не надо, чтоб убить этих Маглов
Стреляю по Маглам, стреляю по Маглам

360,"Turn The Beat Around (From ""The Specialist"")","[Life MC]
Yo Yo
Check check yo
Every man acknowledge my polished
Metaphoric graphic logic and knowledge
It's like my brain is on anabolics
My sound is raw
I'm more Fostex than Panasonic
Man I'm on this
Every mic i smoke it like a bag of chronic
Panoramic pictureful trails
I'm known to prophesise
My potent poetic rhymes are perfection personified
Producing paranormal activity lyrically
My levitating literacy has you meditating literally

[Leaf Dog]
Beat specialist
8 bar attack plan
Rely on this like your second time at a fat scam
Attack mic stands like cantona fans
Never squealin' on the hook like abattoir lambs
Everything I make bangs like a nuclear scientist
Loop ?? burn samples the arsonist
Bump this vibration on the ground is elevation
If your looking up to fly in space
There's no limitation

[Smellington Piff]
I'm here to open your brain like a lobotomist
I'll jump out of a plane to stay on top of this
Around here we live by the wicker man theory, eerie
Pick a thick fickle brain apart, let it pickle in the jar
Lock stock traffic cop, knocked out for tryna stick tickets on your caravan
I'm that scallywag vagabond traveller man
That reads tea leaves and casts spells like Saruman

[Si Philli]
The hard barrer
Spirit of Che Guavara
Rap bandits see me riding the track on a Kuwahara
This is karma
This dark guy lightin' for dark sky
Spittin I'm bringin' sight to rappers like im arc eye
Divine rhymer
Lines finer than white china
Illin' my spits, still comin' sharper than lime cider
These real words we stay puffin' them ill herbs
Flippin' the biggest scriptures
Like its written by Spielberg

[BVA]
Free the music
It's been caged till it became raged and abusive
Escaped on some new shit
Sewin' seeds like a dog with 2 dicks
Now they're seein movements like some cockroaches moved in
Duke Nukem
Drink liquor till this jukes pukin'
Beat loopin', speak truth and shit when its suitin'
The sheep troopin' in the need to get white
Cos comme ci, comme ça, no peace, no pipe

[Cracker Jon]
Ay yo i could do with two bun of the buddha skunk
Kat im chewin up so just losing the funk
Hoodie up and im screwing your mum
A ruthless cunt
True Anglo-Saxon words used from my tongue
Abusing my lungs
Drinking juice and rum
So choose your way to depart this earth
I'm getting scared when my heart hurts
Hackin' barclays passwords
I got a parched thirst

[Jehst]
On beat and off key
So many white boys on the track steal the milkybars are on me
Mr Dairylea
Smoke cheese till my eyes turn so chinese
I can barely see
Turn the beat in to UFC blood sport
Food on the table
Money for the slum lord
We puff draw in large amounts, much more
Totally stonefaced
Mount Rushmore

[Jack Jetson]
High writing this shit
The sky scientist
Jack climbin up the weedstalk to where the giant lives
Kaleidoscope, tight-ropin' psychedelic cyclist
Eyes closed mind open isometric spiralin'
Sad rappers play the hypothetic violin
Ain't got time to grin thats why humors stay as dry as gin
Super human with the mutant thing that lies within
Creepin' through the sewers like reptilians with slimy skin

[Dirty Dike]
Pit bike, prick on the back
Half ounce of chop
Shoutin' bollocks like I absolutely can't be stopped
Take a Stanley to your string Gabanna rani top
And stick a green banana up your rinky dinky party slot
Pick a seat and you can get a free dick
And sit and keep dog like my Pekinese bitch
Mecca mecca means shit
I kick a rapper in a piss cloud
Make the shit evaporate away
Shit now

[Verb t]
I punch drunk throwin jabs at a blurry shape
Learnt my fate in the mud by the pearly gates
I set the bar high, fools aren't reachin' it
Yo look feeble kid, bro, do you even lift? (spot me bruv)
I spun spells on these dumbells
Send them all back to the bench looking unwell
You're having issue with development
I'm guessin' thats the reason why them fools stay negative

[Sonnyjim]
Brain stormin'
Downpourin'
A soundboardin'
If its beef i bring it to your crib, like a housewarmin'
Raps is poingant
If I drive this joint in
Thats a joint, actin' boistrous, packin# oysters
Fandabadozi
When you know I eat the canelloni
On the case like Axel Foley
All of these rappers know me
Some of these trappers know me
I grew up right around the corner cuzzy
Ask your homie

[Mysdiggi]
Slicin' coconuts
Toppin' up his isotopes
Mys is known to magnify your focus more than rifle scopes
Walking with the dead
Soon sure to hit the ledge
Not a task at all to answer all
The voices in his head
It's OJ before he stashed that glove
Helpin you reach your final destination
Quicker than your satnav does
A badman
Who has mad stance and packs that punch
Let him know its never ending like a fat mans lunch
Mother Lovers

[Klashnekoff]
Fuck a tweet chatter your beak
And leeks pasa?
Bet you if we catch you you’ll leak your weak bladder
Put ya strand on ya, ya piece and tell you no speak nadda
This is people pieces, not sweet like its pina colada
Or Tropicana, or any fool that's from the Bahamas
No banana, no pineapple, no mango, no guava
Nah its 'Lash man
Back on my grizzle grind
For rizzle for shankle for shizzle my nizzle my nine

[Fliptrix]
Couldn't sum this up like a monkey with an abacus
Mad absinthe's eradicating any abstinence
So far gone I need some psychoanalysis
My biro writes through these time clock parameters
Live life in the balance like a tightrope fanatic
Flip lives long when the 5-0 hunt the cannabis
It's like magic with a puff of the smoke how he vanishes
Yet still pulls rabbits out the hat like Paul Daniels

[Bill Shakes]
Smell the vodka
Do your for your bread and butter
Slap ya out your Ralph Lauren teddy jumper
Belly buster
Lost your pill rent another
Look mate I push weight
Dont get toned up munchin' a tesco drug
Lookin' like death warmed up
I'll send the thunder
Lightning quick
Time to split
Cause like minus 6
We ignite that piff
Line of chizz, Heinekens and a tiny bitch

[Eric The Red]
It's Eric The Red
The uncontrollable, unmouldable
Unapproachable, know-it-all
Your shit sounds watered down like its soluble
Keep it low key like a crime thats unsolvable
Like a bowlin' ball spinnin' in the alley
Fuck wearin' a bally
Chillin' in death valley
Await the finale like a heavyweight title
Without Bear Grylls livin' a life of survival

[King Kashmere]
The real pow wow not the fake vibrational
Your row now quakes the foundational
Listen to the don with the necronomicon in his palm
And the fire that he vomits upon
Hitch a ride then the comet is gone
Til the next star system
With orion girls droppin her thong
All hail the mad titan
The scavenger of flesh
Tryna court the affections of the avatar of death

[Remus]
Chasin' rappers like the owe me somethin'
I just updated
This one on some whole new function
They can't out run me
I teleport em both and crumble
Before armour make 'em disappear those two jumpers
These ain't steps
These leaps, those humungous
You get trampled just for playin' games
No jumanji
Roll that dice
And double when we roll up on him
You couldn't
Focus high enough to see the gold im ??

You little piggies pork bellied for the carnivore (a grudge match)
I'm out huntin' with the dinosaur (don't mention age)

(AHHHHHHH...) You fuckin' egg fried gassin'
Red face rotten psychopathic tiny accent??
The buddha face baby, toothache and headbangin'
Lowlife, the reunion without the Braintax in

[Chester P]
My slang's [clarity?], words of a dirty feathered blitz
Persecutin' verses emerging on empty headed kids
Burst your purse in the search for a piece of solid food
My world's a hurricane surroundin' me with solitude
How many sheep are here to count before I fall asleep?
A twisted guy in a permanent type of war with peace

361,Bad Reputation,"[Verse 1]
She got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
And all of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't, let it go, oh no
'Cause she's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Verse 2]
She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'
I'm beggin' her please, don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all I want though

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Bridge]
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the weight that’s on her shoulders, said
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you
And I don't care what they, say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
Trust me I could be the one to, treat you like a lady
Let me see, what's underneath
All I need is you

[Verse 1]
Imagine if Biggie and Pac never got shot
And they both still were rulers of hip hop
And Puffy and Suge was roomates from college
And Big L never got found in the alley
And Nas and Jay-Z they were still homies
Squash the beef with Ja Rule and 50
Hey! And Benzino shook hands with Eminem
And on the same record I heard Eve, Fox and Kim
And sometimes when I sleep, yeah, that's when I wake up
Yeah, I kinda hoped that The Fugees didn't break up
When they walked into the studio I prayed they didn't spray
Cause I miss that scratch from Jam Master Jay (Whoa oh oh!!!)
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
In the words of Scarface lord
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Balong, balong, balong, whoa whoa whoa!

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
You can't blame it on the game of hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see
What we see is reality
The ghetto's the ghetto you got them livin in sorrow
And they not promised tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Yeah! Hey!
Imagine if Big Pun was still alive
I could see Fat Joe screamin Terror Squad
Imagine if there were still four survivors still in Destiny's Child
And TLC never lost they Left Eye
Imagine Refugees never needin a passport
John Forte never at Newark Airport
The Million Man March, man, that was a start
Now I need a million more to meet me at Central Park
When the revolution start y'all 'gon have to play this
Free Slick Rick he can't get deported
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
In the words of Scarface lord
I never seen a man cry till I seen a man die
Balong, balong, balong, whoa whoa whoa!

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide
Black on black crime needs to stop
You can't blame it on the game of hip hop
Cause what we say is what we see

And they not promised tomorrow

[Verse 3]
Yeah! Yo!
In the club never though Shyne shot the gun
But in the limosine JLO had to run
Paparazzi snap a shot through the mirror
That's when I saw a smile from Princess Diana
Back and forth and forth and back
Like Miss Aaliyah man do I miss her
The war goes on with The ROC and The Lox
Murder INC, G- Unit it's a fight to the top
Stop! We lost too many soldiers like Freaky Tah
While they get the cover of a magazine we got to die
We got to die, we got to die, we got to die
Lord we got to die, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Chorus]
Shots go off, mother's cry
Death since rise, homicide

Yeah
Yeah

Look, I just shed tears homie and no I ain't too proud to admit it
Just seen my father for the first time in a minute
When I say a minute I mean years man
Damn, a whale could have swam in them tears fam
Cause as I left em' I reflected on my younger days
When it was just me and my brother and my mother played
Father, ‘cause no other man bothered
Not even my biological, it never seemed logical
But I accepted it 'cause I ain't know no better
Thought I was brighter than a Polo sweater
No pops was like Martin with no Coretta
So many things you could have told me
And saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
I feel like you barely know me
And that's a shame ‘cause our last name is the same
That blood type flowing through our veins is the same
My mama left you and it may be that anger's to blame
But that's no excuse, only you and God know the truth
And why you only call monthly, barely ever saw me
Spend some summers with you and played with my cousin Maury
Maybe I should be telling you “fuck you” ‘cause you selfish
But I want a father so bad, I can't help but...

Break down
I break down
Can't help but break down
I break down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I never thought I'd see my mama on that shit, man
It's fucking with her body, now she sick, damn
I wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
Who would have ever thought that it would come to this, man?
Quicksand is what this life feel like
That shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
You made a milli off of serving hard white? Yeah right
My mama tell you what addicted to that pipe feel like
Stupid niggas, I heard the cops be shooting niggas
I swear to God, wish I could bulletproof my niggas
Can't get no jobs, but they still recruiting niggas
We trying to stand tall when it get too crucial niggas

Break down, we break down
We break down, we break down
Break the break down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, He's serving time, locked down
And she don't want nobody to know
His daughter 25 pounds
By the time he get out, she gon' be 4
Now will his girl stay down?
Ain't no doubt she love him, yeah that's for sure
But temptation stays round
And if she strayed, how could he ever know? Never know
And so, she goes to the club on the weekend
A little freaking, but them niggas holla, but she never speakin'
But tonight I see the devil creeping
'Cause she been lonely, she ain't felt a man in seven seasons
Damn! She doin the best that she can
Her mama tellin' her to find another man
She college educated with a felon boyfriend
That's what she thinkin' tonight
Maybe she's right, but please

Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama
Please
Stay down mama
Gotta be strong, don't break down mama

All you gotta do is knock and I'll let you in
Then we will feel the passion that flows within
I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go

[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and come with me
And let me show you true ecstacy
Boy, be brave, don't be afraid
'Cause tonight we're gonna go all the way
I don't mean to be bold
But I gotta let you know
I got a thing for you and I can't let go

[Chorus]
Age ain't nothin' but a number
Throwin' down ain't nothin' but a thang
This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change

368,(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name,"Somebody was spreading rumors
'Bout better days a-comin'
Why was I hummin'
As if I knew
One and the same
But I just whispered your name

Somebody was sayin' something
'Bout there being an end to tyranny
But when they asked me
What would I do
If that day came
I only whispered your name

Everyone got their own opinion
And protects their own dominion
No doubt for them it's true
But I tell them what I really believe
My only worry is protecting you, yeah

No one should ever be lonely
We'd all find somebody to care
Ask me if I dare
To answer who
Could carry that flame
I'd just whisper your name

Everyone got their own opinion
And protects their own dominion
No doubt for them it's true
But I tell them what I really believe
My only worry is protecting you

Nobody should ever be lonely
We'd all find someone to care, well
Ask me if I dare
To answer who
Could carry that flame
Carry that flame, yeah

369,"Shame (From ""A Low Down Dirty Shame"")","[Down]       Jealousy is envy
And I know it eats you up inside
Stop hatin'
[Nikki Diaz] Yeah, yeah, yeah

Chorus:
[Fingazz]    Don't hate the player, hate the gate
[Nikki Diaz] Don't be jealous of me
[Fingazz]    Don't knock my hustle or my fame
[Nikki Diaz] Don't be jealous

(Verse 1)
[Down]    For all the same, everywhere that you go
'Bout eighty-five percent, go be hatin' on your throat
Hatin' on your hustle
Hatin' on your flow
Hatin' cause you move fast, and they move slow
But I ain't trippin', though
I stay hittin' dro
And you never catch me slackin', I'm a pimpin'
I'm a don
You just a peon
My game sold like a fresh can of Free-On
I got big cake
And they just want a slice
Give 'em just a little
And now they want your ice
You're crazy
And too damn lazy
[Fingazz] I'm a, I'm a hustler
[Down]    The Chicano Jay-Z
Yeah, they know me in the streets
They know me in the hoods
They know me on the blocks
Everybody know me
And I know you can't sleep
Cause you know I'm livin' good
And you can't make it stop, so jealous

Pre-Chorus:
[Fingazz]    I see you watchin' everything I do
[Nikki Diaz] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Fingazz]    And I know you talkin' bad about me too
[Nikki Diaz] All I gotta say is

Repeat Chorus

Hook: Nikki Diaz
I see you jockin' my whips
And the ice around my wrist
I know you runnin' your lips
I can hear you talkin' shhh...
I hustle for the things I get
You broke, I know my wealth
Next time, you hatin' on me
Take a good look at yourself

[Verse 2: Down (Nikki Diaz)]
So what's the real problem?
What's the issue?
Crying about your own career
Here's a tissue
Actin' like a little kid
Cut the gappin'
Before I get my grown man, on to start clappin'
And you don't want that
End up in a wreck
Like a solo game of chess, put yourself in check
I'm a king
And you a pawn
You do your jealous thing, and I'll get my hustle on
Cause I ain't got no time for the games
And not a damn dime for the dames
Separate the real G's from the lames
It's A Low Down Dirty Shame (Jealous)
But I gotta do what I do
And you gon' do what you do
I got a million to gain, and you got nothin' to lose
And you can love it or hate it
You can sit and debate it
If you really hate the game or the way that you play it
You jealous

370,Supa Star,"[Intro]
Lil' Dap: Damn son
Melachi: What the fuck is wrong with you man?
Shit shouldn't be happening out here man
Niggas don't be realizin' the shit, man
But yo, tell 'em what you be seein' out your window
Lil' Dap: Yo I be seeing out my window gunshots everyday
Melachi:Man yo I be seeing sex money and drugs too but yo
Tell 'em how Duke said
Lil' Dap: The world's about to end

[Verse 1: Melachi the Nutcracker]
Born in the ghetto it's hard to survive
Some have achieved and many brothers tried
But I realized which life to choose
I wanna make money so I gotta pay dues
But there's no rules and you only have one chance
If ya fuck up kid you face the circumstance
At night I used to scream and shout
Livin' in the ghetto trying to get the hell out
So I would try as I watch my friends die
But all I could do was sit back and cry
These are feelings I'm expressing through my rhymes
I been through hard times so many problems on my mind
I wasn't living rich and I also wasn't poor
I try to appreciate but I deserve more
Yeah superman supa star
Give me super fat dough like Pablo Escobar
""Super duper star""

[Verse 2: Lil' Dap]
Feared by bandits hated by chicks
Loved by kids I never did a bid
Yes the Group Home is thick
Plus I don't eat beef cause get dizzy if ya think shit is weak
Yo I work hard and hard my man trace it down to the car
After that keep it movin' have no time to be foolin'
Around town A&R's you get down with the hype sound
The things I say will make a grown man dream
I speak sayings ""Go by yourself, be by yourself""
Let my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth
I travel ghetto to ghetto, back streets to the street
Kick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind
Mom dukes used to tell me with these tears in her eyes
Now I'm out on my own survival with the dime
Like an African tribe little Dap will blow your mind
Check it out like this

Melachi:
And then like that

""Super star""

(""Yes the Group Home is thick so all y'all punks hear this)"" (x3)

(""Yo check it check it out like this here we go"")

[Verse 3: Melachi]
Walkin' the tunnels of hell the next level
It's the Nutcracker givin' hell to the devil
Playin' the game the New York pain
Makes me wanna bust but I just maintain
Cause nowadays I talk to a brother
Always love your mother cause you'll never get another
In the streets bustin' off shots fuck the cops
I got superstar props
Big time doe, money is a thriller
I'm gettin' more iller than the Zodiac killer
No lie but before I say bye
You can't take money with cha when you die

""Super duper star""

[Verse 4: Lil' Dap]
Yo I got niggas flipping they wig
Chicks grabbing they cunts
As they rhyme they get doper and then they greet me with blunts
One times for your mind before I break these streets
Ain't nothing holding me back hip hop track
Yo son you know the feelin' shit will get revealed
As the times will get better
And you know I got skills I seen the days turn into nights
As the stars shine bright
Motherfuckers Moet and chicks they keep steppin'
Like Dom Perignon one day will live large
Word to Allah and it don't seem hard
No more jealousy and envy
Curse is put upon me
Watch me live free at the clink
With my niggas you'll see
Raising to the top like a rocket ship, yo I go far

Where'd you go?
Who you know?
How I've been living without you
Daydreaming on a cloud with you like horizon
With you 'til the night ends on a island, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time for making up
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you
Oh, just to know you were the truth
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

[Chorus]
Can I tell you something, for what it's worth?
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you
Show you something, give you more than words
With you, Heaven is a place on Earth
And I will take you there, I'll take you there
Take you there

[Verse 2]
Fill me up 'til my cup's overflowing
I'm so anxious just to feel the silence
It's so quiet, but I hear you
Saying to me baby

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about time for making up (Time for making up)
The times you wasn't with me waking up
Lying if I said I didn't miss your touch
I needed to, I needed to
Needed to distance myself from you (You)
Oh, just to know you were the truth (Oh)
So come closer, won't you? Won't you?

373,Practice What You Preach,"You think your life's so grand
You don't believe a word you say
Your feet aren't on the ground
You let your life just slip away
Just so uncertain of your body and your soul
The promises you make your mind go blank
And then you lose control, then you lose control!

I never was the one, the one to say
The things you say
Never seem to wonder what you say
You think you've got your life completely in control
You've got a lot to learn, the bridge you burned
It's gonna take its toll!
Pay the burnt bridge toll!

So practice what you preach!
Practice what you preach!
Practice what you preach!
Practice what you preach!

You think your life's so grand
You don't believe a word you say
Your feet aren't on the ground
You let your life just slip away
Just so uncertain of your body and your soul

They really want you, they really do
Yeah, they really want you
They really want you, and I do too

[Chorus]
I want to be the girl with the most cake
I love him so much, it just turns to hate

And someday you will ache like I ache
And someday you will ache like I ache

375,That's Just What You Are,"[Verse 1]
In our endeavor we are never seeing eye to eye
No guts to serve us so forever may we wave goodbye
And you're always telling me that it's my turn to move
When I wonder what could make the needle jump the groove

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall for the oldest trick in the book
So don't sit there and think you're off of the hook
By saying there is no use changing 'cause

[Chorus]
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

[Verse 2]
Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears
By suggesting that a change might be a thing to try
Like it would kill you just to try and be a nicer guy

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not like you would lose some critical piece
If somehow you moved Point A to Point B
Maintaining there is no point changing 'cause

[Chorus]
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

[Bridge]
Now I could talk to you till I'm blue in the face
But we still would arrive at the very same place
With you running around and me out of the race

[Verse 3]
So maybe you're right, nobody can take
Something older than time and hope you could make
It better, that would be a mistake

So take it just so far

[Chorus]
'Cause that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are

[Verse 4]
Acting steady always ready to defend your fears
What's the matter with the truth, did I offend your ears
You're like a sleepwalking man, it's a danger to wake you
Even when it is apparent where your actions will take you

[Chorus]
That's just what you are
And that's just what you are
That's just what you are
That's just what you are",Aimee Mann,1995,"[98, 95, 95, 93, 95, 94]",6
376,Do You See,"[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""Warren I told ya""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said ""Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear

377,When We Dance,"[Intro]
If he loves you
Like I love you
I would walk away in shame
I'd move town
I'd change my name

[Chorus 1]
When he watches you
When he counts to buy your soul
On your hand his golden rings
Like he owns a bird that sings

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 1]
The priest has said my soul's salvation
Is in the balance of the angels
And underneath the wheels of passion
I keep the faith in my fashion
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
I'm still in love with you
I'm going to find a place to live
Give you all I've got to give

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

[Verse 2]
If I could break down these walls
And shout my name at heaven's gate
I'd take these hands
And I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate
Cathedrals are broken
Heaven's no longer above
And hellfire's a promise away
I'd still be saying
I'm still in love

He won't love you
Like I love you
He won't care for you this way
He'll mistreat you if you stay
Come and live with me
We'll have children of our own
I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

[Chorus]
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings
When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings

378,I Belong To You/How Many Ways,"[Verse 1]
Big stretch, not much sleep
I got a couple of palm trees on each side of my cheek
And it's a bright blue Saturday
In the rummage, sellin' the rubbish to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
If I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

[Chorus]
If you were standing on the corner
Staring straight in the eyes of Jesus Christ

[Verse 2]
One porch, one dog
And one cockroach, only one way to be
I got sewage fruit and it's growing out back from roots
But I don't know if they belong to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But if I could buy the sky
That's hangin' over this bed of mine
And if I could climb these vines
And maybe see what you're seein'

[Chorus]
If you were sittin' on the edge of this building
Twenty stories below
Below
Twenty stories below
Twenty stories below
Twenty stories below

[Outro]
And I can't tell you how many ways that I've sat
And viewed my life today, but I can tell you
I don't think that I can find easy way
So, if I see you walking hand-in hand-in hand
With a three armed man, you know I'll understand
But you should have been in my shoes, yesterday
You should have been in my shoes, yesterday",Blind Melon,1995,"[42, 37, 34, 30, 28, 29, 30]",7

When can my heart beat again?
When does the pain ever end?
When do the tears stop from running over?
When does ""you'll get over it"" begin?

I hear what you're sayin'
But I swear that it's not making sense
So when can I see you

[Chorus]
When can I see you again?
And when can my heart beat again?
When can I see you again?
And when can I breathe once again?
And when can I see you...

When does my someday begin?
When I'll find someone again?
And what if I still am not truly over
What am I supposed to do then, baby, baby?

Please hear what I'm sayin'
Even if, if it's not making sense

381,"Sympathy For The Devil (""Interview With The Vampire"")","Holmes had read carefully a note which the last post had brought him. Then, with the dry chuckle which was his nearest approach to a laugh, he tossed it over to me.

'For a mixture of the modern and the mediaeval, of the practical and of the wildly fanciful, I think this is surely the limit,' said he. 'What do you make of it, Watson?'
I read as follows:

46 OLD JEWRY
Nov. 19th.
Re Vampires
Sir,
Our client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson & Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, has made some inquiry from us in a communication of even date concerning vampires. As our firm specializes entirely upon the assessment of machinery the matter hardly comes within our purview, and we have therefore recommended Mr Ferguson to call upon you and lay the matter before you. We have not forgotten your successful action in the case of Matilda Briggs.
We are, Sir,
Faithfully yours,
MORRISON, MORRISON, AND DODD
per E.J.C.

'Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson,' said Holmes, in a reminiscent voice. 'It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of Sumatra, a story for which the world is not yet prepared. But what do we know about vampires? Does it come within our purview either? Anything is better than stagnation, but really we seem to have been switched on to a Grimm's fairy tale. Make a long arm, Watson, and see what V has to say.'

I leaned back and took down the great index volume to which he referred. Holmes balanced it on his knee and his eyes moved slowly and lovingly over the record of old cases, mixed with the accumulated information of a lifetime.

'Voyage of the Gloria Scott,' he read. 'That was a bad business. I have some recollection that you made a record of it, Watson, though I was unable to congratulate you upon the result. Victor Lynch, forger. Venomous lizard or gila. Remarkable case, that! Vittoria, the circus belle. Vanderbilt and the Yeggman. Vipers. Vigor, the Hammersmith wonder. Hullo! Hullo! Good old index. You can't beat it. Listen to this, Watson. Vampirism in Hungary. And again, Vampires in Transylvania.' He turned over the pages with eagerness, but after a short intent perusal he threw down the great book with a snarl of disappointment.

'Rubbish, Watson, rubbish! What have we to do with walking corpses who can only be held in their grave by stakes driven through their hearts? It's pure lunacy.'

'But surely,' said I, 'the vampire was not necessarily a dead man? A living person might have the habit. I have read for example, of the old sucking the blood of the young in order to retain their youth.'

'You are right, Watson. It mentions the legend in one of these references. But are we to give serious attention to such things? This agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. The world is big enough for us. No ghosts need apply. I fear that we cannot take Mr Robert Ferguson very seriously. Possibly this note may be from him, and may throw some light upon what is worrying him.'

He took up a second letter which had lain unnoticed upon the table whilst he had been absorbed with the first. This he began to read with a smile of amusement upon his face which gradually faded away into an expression of intense interest and concentration. When he had finished he sat for some little time lost in thought with the letter dangling from his fingers. Finally, with a start, he aroused himself from his reverie.

'Cheeseman's, Lamberley. Where is Lamberley, Watson?'

'It is in Sussex, south of Horsham.'

'Not very far, eh? And Cheeseman's?'

'I know that country, Holmes. It is full of old houses which are named after the men who built them centuries ago. You get Odley's and Harvey's and Carriton's - the folk are forgotten but their names live in their houses.'

'Precisely,' said Holmes coldly. It was one of the peculiarities of his proud, self-contained nature that, though he docketed any fresh information very quickly and accurately in his brain, he seldom made any acknowledgement to the giver. 'I rather fancy we shall know a good deal more about Cheeseman's, Lamberley, before we are through. The letter is, as I had hoped, from Robert Ferguson. By the way, he claims acquaintance with you.'

'With me!'

'You had better read it.'
He handed the letter across. It was headed with the address quoted.

Dear Mr Holmes, [it said]

I have been recommended to you by my lawyers, but indeed the matter is so extraordinarily delicate that it is most difficult to discuss. It concerns a friend for whom I am acting. This gentleman married some five years ago a Peruvian lady, the daughter of a Peruvian merchant, whom he had met in connection with the importation of nitrates. The lady was very beautiful, but the fact of her foreign birth and of her alien religion always caused a separation of interests and of feelings between husband and wife, so that after a time his love may have cooled towards her and he may have come to regard their union as a mistake. He felt there were sides of her character which he could never explore or understand. This was the more painful as she was as loving a wife as a man could have - to all appearance absolutely devoted.

Now for the point which I will make more plain when we meet. Indeed, this note is merely to give you a general idea of the situation and to ascertain whether you would care to interest yourself in the matter. The lady began to show some curious traits, quite alien to her ordinarily sweet and gentle disposition. The gentleman had been married twice and he had one son by the first wife. This boy was now fifteen, a very charming and affectionate youth, though unhappily injured through an accident in childhood. Twice the wife was caught in the act of assaulting this poor lad in the most unprovoked way. Once she struck him with a stick and left a great weal on his arm.

This was a small matter, however, compared with her conduct to her own child, a dear boy just under one year of age. On one occasion about a month ago this child had been left by its nurse for a few minutes. A loud cry from the baby, as of pain, called the nurse back. As she ran into the room she saw her employer, the lady, leaning over the baby and apparently biting his neck. There was a small wound in the neck, from which a stream of blood had escaped. The nurse was so horrified that she wished to call the husband, but the lady implored her not to do so, and actually gave her five pounds as a price for her silence. No explanation was ever given, and for the moment the matter was passed over.

It left, however, a terrible impression upon the nurse's mind, and from that time she began to watch her mistress closely, and to keep a closer guard upon the baby, whom she tenderly loved. It seemed to her that even as she watched the mother, so the mother watched her, and that every time she was compelled to leave the baby alone the mother was waiting to get at it. Day and night the nurse covered the child, and day and night the silent, watchful mother seemed to be lying in wait as a wolf waits for a lamb. It must read most incredible to you, and yet I beg you to take it seriously, for a child's life and a man's sanity may depend upon it.

At last there came one dreadful day when the facts could no longer be concealed from the husband. The nurse's nerve had given way, she could stand the strain no longer, and she made a clean breast of it all to the man. To him it seemed as wild a tale as it may now seem to you. He knew his wife to be a loving wife, and, save for the assaults upon her stepson, a loving mother. Why, then, should she wound her own dear little baby? He told the nurse that she was dreaming, that her suspicions were those of a lunatic, and that such libels upon her mistress were not to be tolerated. Whilst they were talking, a sudden cry of pain was heard. Nurse and master rushed together to the nursery. Imagine his feelings, Mr Holmes, as he saw his wife rise from a kneeling position beside the cot, and saw blood upon the child's exposed neck and upon the sheet. With a cry of horror, he turned his wife's face to the light and saw blood all round her lips. It was she - she beyond all question - who had drunk the poor baby's blood.

So the matter stands. She is now confined to her room. There has been no explanation. The husband is half demented. He knows, and I know, little of Vampirism beyond the name. We had thought it was some wild tale of foreign parts. And yet here in the very heart of the English Sussex - well, all this can be discussed with you in the morning. Will you see me? Will you use your great powers in aiding a distracted man? If so, kindly wire to Ferguson, Cheeseman's, Lamberley, and I will be at your rooms by ten o'clock.

Yours faithfully,
ROBERT FERGUSON

PS. - I believe your friend Watson played Rugby for Blackheath when I was three-quarter for Richmond. It is the only personal introduction which I can give.

'Of course I remember him,' said I, as I laid down the letter. 'Big Bob Ferguson, the finest three-quarter Richmond ever had. He was always a good-natured chap. It's like him to be so concerned over a friend's case.'

Holmes looked at me thoughtfully and shook his head.
'I never get your limits, Watson,' said he. 'There are unexplored possibilities about you. Take a wire down, like a good fellow.

""Will examine your case with pleasure.""'

'Your case!'

'We must not let him think that this agency is a home for the weak-minded. Of course it is his case. Send him that wire and let the matter rest till morning.'

Promptly at ten o'clock next morning Ferguson strode into our room. I had remembered him as a long, slab-sided man with loose limbs and a fine turn of speed, which had carried him round many an opposing back. There is surely nothing in life more painful than to meet the wreck of a fine athlete whom one has known in his prime. His great frame had fallen in, his flaxen hair was scanty, and his shoulders were bowed. I fear that I roused corresponding emotions in him.

'Hullo, Watson,' said he, and his voice was still deep and hearty. 'You don't look quite the man you did when I threw you over the ropes into the crowd at the Old Deer Park. I expect I have changed a bit also. But it's this last day or two that has aged me. I see by your telegram, Mr Holmes, that it is no use my pretending to be anyone's deputy.'

'It is simpler to deal direct,' said Holmes.

'Of course it is. But you can imagine how difficult it is when you are speaking of the one woman you are bound to protect and help. What can I do? How am I to go to the police with such a story? And yet the kiddies have got to be protected. Is it madness, Mr Holmes? Is it something in the blood? Have you any similar case in your experience? For God's sake, give me some advice, for I am at my wits' end.'

'Very naturally, Mr Ferguson. Now sit here and pull yourself together and give me a few clear answers. I can assure you that I am very far from being at my wits' end, and that I am confident we shall find some solution. First of all, tell me what steps you have taken. Is your wife still near the children?'
'We had a dreadful scene. She is a most loving woman, Mr Holmes. If ever a woman loved a man with all her heart and soul, she loves me. She was cut to the heart that I should have discovered this horrible, this incredible, secret. She would not even speak. She gave no answer to my reproaches, save to gaze at me with a sort of wild, despairing look in her eyes. Then she rushed to her room and locked herself in. Since then she has refused to see me. She has a maid who was with her before her marriage, Dolores by name - a friend rather than a servant. She takes her food to her.'

'Then the child is in no immediate danger?'

'Mrs Mason, the nurse, has sworn that she will not leave it night or day. I can absolutely trust her. I am more uneasy about poor little Jack, for, as I told you in my note, he has twice been assaulted by her.'

'But never wounded?'

'No, she struck him savagely. It is the more terrible as he is a poor little inoffensive cripple.' Ferguson's gaunt features softened as he spoke of his boy. 'You would think that the dear lad's condition would soften anyone's heart. A fall in childhood and a twisted spine, Mr Holmes. But the dearest, most loving heart within.'

Holmes had picked up the letter of yesterday and was reading it over. 'What other inmates are there in your house, Mr Ferguson?'

'Two servants who have not been long with us. One stablehand, Michael, who sleeps in the house. My wife, myself, my boy Jack, baby, Dolores, and Mrs Mason. That is all.'

'I gather that you did not know your wife well at the time of your marriage?'

'I had only known her a few weeks.'

'How long had this maid Dolores been with her?'

'Some years.'

'Then your wife's character would really be better known by Dolores than by you?'

'Yes, you may say so.'
Holmes made a note.

'I fancy', said he, 'that I may be of more use at Lamberley than here. It is eminently a case for personal investigation. If the lady remains in her room, our presence could not annoy or inconvenience her. Of course, we would stay at the inn.'
Ferguson gave a gesture of relief.

'It is what I hoped, Mr Holmes. There is an excellent train at two from Victoria, if you could come.'

'Of course we could come. There is a lull at present. I can give you my undivided energies. Watson, of course, comes with us. But there are one or two points upon which I wish to be very sure before I start. This unhappy lady as I understand it, has appeared to assault both the children, her own baby and your little son?'

'That is so.'

'But the results take different forms, do they not? She has beaten your son.'

'Once with a stick and once very savagely with her hands.'

'Did she give no explanation why she struck him?'

'None, save that she hated him. Again and again she said so.'

'Well, that is not unknown among stepmothers. A posthumous jealousy, we will say. Is the lady jealous by nature?'

'Yes, she is very jealous - jealous with all the strength of her fiery tropical love.'

'But the boy - he is fifteen, I understand, and probably very developed in mind, since his body has been circumscribed in action. Did he give you no explanation of these assaults?'

'No, he declared there was no reason.'

'Were they good friends at other times?'

'No, there was never any love between them.'

'Yet you say he is affectionate?'

'Never in the world could there be so devoted a son. My life is his life. He is absorbed in what I say or do.'
Once again Holmes made a note. For some time he sat lost in thought.

'No doubt you and the boy were great comrades before this second marriage. You were thrown very close together, were you not?'

'Very much so.'

'And the boy, having so affectionate a nature, was devoted, no doubt, to the memory of his mother?'

'Most devoted.'

'He would certainly seem to be a most interesting lad. There is one other point about these assaults. Were the strange attacks upon the baby and the assaults upon your son at the same period?'

'In the first case it was so. It was as if some frenzy had seized her, and she had vented her rage upon both. In the second case it was only Jack who suffered. Mrs Mason had no complaint to make about the baby.'

'That certainly complicates matters.'

'I don't quite follow you, Mr Holmes.'

'Possibly not. One forms provisional theories and waits for time or fuller knowledge to explode them. A bad habit, Mr Ferguson, but human nature is weak. I fear that your old friend here has given an exaggerated view of my scientific methods. However, I will only say at the present stage that your problem does not appear to me to be insoluble, and that you may expect to find us at Victoria at two o'clock.'

It was evening of a dull, foggy November day when, having left our bags at the 'Chequers', Lamberley, we drove through the Sussex clay of a long winding lane, and finally reached the isolated and ancient farmhouse in which Ferguson dwelt. It was a large, straggling building, very old in the centre, very new at the wings, with towering Tudor chimneys and a lichen-spotted, high-pitched roof of Horsham slabs. The doorsteps were worn into curves, and the ancient tiles which lined the porch were marked with the rebus of a cheese and a man, after the original builder. Within, the ceilings were corrugated with heavy oaken beams, and the uneven floors sagged into sharp curves. An odour of age and decay pervaded the whole crumbling building.

There was one very large central room, into which Ferguson led us. Here, in a huge old-fashioned fireplace with an iron screen behind it dated 1670, there blazed and spluttered a splendid log fire.

The room, as I gazed round, was a most singular mixture of dates and of places. The half-panelled walls may well have belonged to the original yeoman farmer of the seventeenth century. They were ornamented, however, on the lower part by a line of well-chosen modern water-colours, while above, where yellow plaster took the place of oak, there was hung a fine collection of South American utensils and weapons, which had been brought, no doubt, by the Peruvian lady upstairs. Holmes rose, with that quick curiosity which sprang from his eager mind, and examined them with some care. He returned with his eyes full of thought.

'Hullo!' he cried. 'Hullo!'
A spaniel had lain in a basket in the corner. It came slowly forward towards its master, walking with difficulty. Its hind legs moved irregularly and its tail was on the ground. It licked Ferguson's hand.

'What is it, Mr Holmes?'

'The dog. What's the matter with it?'

'That's what puzzled the vet. A sort of paralysis. Spinal meningitis, he thought. But it is passing. He'll be all right soon - won't you, Carlo?' A shiver of assent passed through the drooping tail. The dog's mournful eyes passed from one of us to the other. He knew that we were discussing his case.

'Did it come on suddenly?'

'In a single night.'

'How long ago?'
'It may have been four months ago.'

'Very remarkable. Very suggestive.'

'What do you see in it, Mr Holmes?'

'A confirmation of what I had already thought.'

'For God's sake, what do you think, Mr Holmes? It may be a mere intellectual puzzle to you, but it is life and death to me! My wife a would-be murderer - my child in constant danger! Don't play with me, Mr Holmes. It is too terribly serious.'
The big Rugby three-quarter was trembling all over. Holmes put his hand soothingly upon his arm.

'I fear that there is pain for you, Mr Ferguson, whatever the solution may be,' said he. 'I would spare you all I can. I cannot say more for the instant, but before I leave this house I hope I may have something definite.'

'Please God you may! If you will excuse me, gentlemen, I will go up to my wife's room and see if there has been any change.'
He was away some minutes, during which Holmes resumed his examination of the curiosities upon the wall. When our host returned it was clear from his downcast face that he had made no progress. He brought with him, a tall, slim, brown-faced girl.

'The tea is ready, Dolores,' said Ferguson. 'See that your mistress has everything she can wish.'

'She verra ill,' cried the girl, looking with indignant eyes at her master. 'She no ask for food. She verra ill. She need doctor. I frightened stay alone with her without doctor.'
Ferguson looked at me with a question in his eyes.

'I should be so glad if I could be of use.'

'Would your mistress see Dr Watson?'

'I take him. I no ask leave. She needs doctor.'

'Then I'll come with you at once.'
I followed the girl, who was quivering with strong emotion, up the staircase and down an ancient corridor. At the end was an iron-clamped and massive door. It struck me as I looked at it that if Ferguson tried to force his way to his wife he would find it no easy matter. The girl drew a key from her pocket, and the heavy oaken planks creaked upon their old hinges. I passed in and she swiftly followed, fastening the door behind her.

On the bed a woman was lying who was clearly in a high fever. She was only half conscious, but as I entered she raised a pair of frightened but beautiful eyes and glared at me in apprehension. Seeing a stranger, she appeared to be relieved, and sank back with a sigh upon the pillow. I stepped up to her with a few reassuring words, and she lay still while I took her pulse and temperature. Both were high, and yet my impression was that the condition was rather that of mental and nervous excitement than of any actual seizure.

'She lie like that one day, two day. I 'fraid she die,' said the girl.
The woman turned her flushed and handsome face towards me.

'Where is my husband?'

'He is below, and would wish to see you.'

'I will not see him. I will not see him.' Then she seemed to wander off into delirium. 'A fiend! A fiend! Oh, what shall I do with this devil?'

'Can I help you in any way?'

'No. No one can help. It is finished. All is destroyed. Do what I will, all is destroyed.'
The woman must have some strange delusion. I could not see honest Bob Ferguson in the character of fiend or devil.

'Madame,' I said, 'your husband loves you dearly. He is deeply grieved at this happening.'
Again she turned on me those glorious eyes.

'He loves me. Yes. But do I not love him? Do I not love him even to sacrifice myself rather than break his dear heart. That is how I love him. And yet he could think of me - he could speak to me so.'

'He is full of grief, but he cannot understand.'

'No, he cannot understand. But he should trust.'

'Will you not see him?' I suggested.

'No, no, I cannot forget those terrible words nor the look upon his face. I will not see him. Go now. You can do nothing for me. Tell him only one thing. I want my child. I have a right to my child. That is the only message I can send him.' She turned her face to the wall and would say no more.

I returned to the room downstairs, where Ferguson and Holmes still sat by the fire. Ferguson listened moodily to my account of the interview.

'How can I send her the child?' he said. 'How do I know what strange impulse might come upon her? How can I ever forget how she rose from beside it with its blood on her lips?' He shuddered at the recollection. 'The child is safe with Mrs Mason, and there he must remain.'

A smart maid, the only modern thing which we had seen in the house, had brought in some tea. As she was serving it the door opened and a youth entered the room. He was a remarkable lad, pale-faced and fair-haired, with excitable light blue eyes which blazed into a sudden flame of emotion and joy as they rested upon his father. He rushed forward and threw his arms round his neck with the abandon of a loving girl.

'Oh, daddy,' he cried, 'I did not know that you were due yet. I should have been here to meet you. Oh, I am so glad to see you!'

Ferguson gently disengaged himself from the embrace with some little show of embarrassment.

'Dear old chap,' said he, patting the flaxen head with a very tender hand. 'I came early because my friends, Mr Holmes and Dr Watson, have been persuaded to come down and spend an evening with us.'

'Is that Mr Holmes, the detective?'

'Yes.'
The youth looked at us with a very penetrating and, as it seemed to me, unfriendly gaze.

'What about your other child, Mr Ferguson?' asked Holmes. 'Might we make the acquaintance of the baby?'

'Ask Mrs Mason to bring baby down,' said Ferguson. The boy went off with a curious, shambling gait which told my surgical eyes that he was suffering from a weak spine. Presently he returned, and behind him came a tall, gaunt woman bearing in her arms a very beautiful child, darkeyed, golden-haired, a wonderful mixture of the Saxon and the Latin. Ferguson was evidently devoted to it, for he took it into his arms and fondled it most tenderly.

'Fancy anyone having the heart to hurt him,' he muttered, as he glanced down at the small, angry red pucker upon the cherub throat.

It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Holmes, and saw a most singular intentness in his expression. His face was as set as if it had been carved out of old ivory, and his eyes, which had glanced for a moment at father and child, were now fixed with eager curiosity upon something at the other side of the room. Following his gaze I could only guess that he was looking out through the window at the melancholy, dripping garden. It is true that a shutter had half closed outside and obstructed the view, but none the less it was certainly at the window that Holmes was fixing his concentrated attention.

Then he smiled, and his eyes came back to the baby. On its chubby neck there was this small puckered mark. Without speaking, Holmes examined it with care. Finally he shook one of the dimpled fists which waved in front of him.

'Good-bye, little man. You have made a strange start in life. Nurse, I should wish to have a word with you in private.'
He took her aside and spoke earnestly for a few minutes. I only heard the last words, which were: 'Your anxiety will soon, I hope, be set at rest.' The woman, who seemed to be a sour, silent kind of creature, withdrew with the child.

'What is Mrs Mason like?' asked Holmes.

'Not very prepossessing externally, as you can see, but a heart of gold, and devoted to the child.'

'Do you like her, Jack?' Holmes turned suddenly upon the boy. His expressive mobile face shadowed over, and he shook his head.

'Jacky has very strong likes and dislikes,' said Ferguson, putting his arm round the boy. 'Luckily I am one of his likes.'
The boy cooed and nestled his head upon his father's breast. Ferguson gently disengaged him.

'Run away, little Jacky,' said he, and he watched his son with loving eyes until he disappeared. 'Now, Mr Holmes,' he continued, when the boy was gone. 'I really feel that I have brought you on a fool's errand, for what can you possibly do, save give your sympathy? It must be an exceedingly delicate and complex affair from your point of view.'

'It is certainly delicate,' said my friend, with an amused smile, 'but I have not been struck up to now with its complexity. It has been a case for intellectual deduction, but when this original intellectual deduction is confirmed point by point by quite a number of independent incidents, then the subjective becomes objective and we can say confidently that we have reached our goal. I had, in fact, reached it before we left Baker Street, and the rest has merely been observation and confirmation.'

Ferguson put his big hand to his furrowed forehead.

'For heaven's sake, Holmes,' he said hoarsely, 'if you can see the truth in this matter, do not keep me in suspense. How do I stand? What shall I do? I care nothing as to how you have found your facts so long as you have really got them.'

'Certainly I owe you an explanation, and you shall have it. But you will permit me to handle the matter in my own way? Is the lady capable of seeing us, Watson?'

'She is ill, but she is quite rational.'

'Very good. It is only in her presence that we can clear the matter up. Let us go up to her.'

'She will not see me,' cried Ferguson.

'Oh, yes, she will,' said Holmes. He scribbled a few lines upon a sheet of paper. 'You at least have the entrée, Watson. Will you have the goodness to give the lady this note?'
I ascended again and handed the note to Dolores, who cautiously opened the door. A minute later I heard a cry from within, a cry in which joy and surprise seemed to be blended. Dolores looked out.

'She will see them. She will leesten,' said she.
At my summons Ferguson and Holmes came up. As we entered the room Ferguson took a step or two towards his wife, who had raised herself in the bed, but she held out her hand to repulse him. He sank into an arm-chair, while Holmes seated himself beside him, after bowing to the lady, who looked at him with wide-eyed amazement.

'I think we can dispense with Dolores,' said Holmes. 'Oh, very well, madame, if you would rather she stayed I can see no objection. Now, Mr Ferguson, I am a busy man with many calls, and my methods have to be short and direct. The swiftest surgery is the least painful. Let me first say what will ease your mind. Your wife is a very good, a very loving, and a very ill-used woman.'
Ferguson sat up with a cry of joy.

'Prove that, Mr Holmes, and I am your debtor for ever.'

'I will do so, but in doing so I must wound you deeply in another direction.'

'I care nothing so long as you clear my wife. Everything on earth is insignificant compared to that.'

'Let me tell you, then, the train of reasoning which passed through my mind in Baker Street. The idea of a vampire was to me absurd. Such things do not happen in criminal practice in England. And yet your observation was precise. You had seen the lady rise from beside the child's cot with the blood upon her lips.'

'I did.'

'Did it not occur to you that a bleeding wound may be sucked for some other purpose than to draw the blood from it? Was there not a Queen in English history who sucked such a wound to draw poison from it?'

'Poison!'

'A South American household. My instinct felt the presence of those weapons upon the wall before my eyes ever saw them. It might have been other poison, but that was what occurred to me. When I saw that little empty quiver beside the small bird-bow, it was just what I expected to see. If the child were pricked with one of those arrows dipped in curare or some other devilish drug, it would mean death if the venom were not sucked out.

And the dog! If one were to use such a poison, would one not try it first in order to see that it had not lost its power? I did not foresee the dog, but at least I understood him and he fitted into my reconstruction.

Now do you understand? Your wife feared such an attack. She saw it made and saved the child's life, and yet she shrank from telling you all the truth, for she knew how you loved the boy and feared lest it break your heart.'

'Jacky!'

'I watched him as you fondled the child just now. His face was clearly reflected in the glass of the window where the shutter formed a background. I saw such jealousy, such cruel hatred, as I have seldom seen in a human face.'

'My Jacky!'

'You have to face it, Mr Ferguson. It is the more painful because it is a distorted love, a maniacal exaggerated love for you, and possibly for his dead mother, which has prompted his action. His very soul is consumed with hatred for this splendid child, whose health and beauty are a contrast to his own weakness.'

'Good God! It is incredible!'

'Have I spoken the truth, madame?'
The lady was sobbing, with her face buried in the pillows. Now she turned to her husband.

'How could I tell you, Bob? I felt the blow it would be to you. It was better that I should wait and that it should come from some other lips than mine. When this gentleman, who seems to have powers of magic, wrote that he knew all, I was glad.'

'I think a year at sea would be my prescription for Master Jacky,' said Holmes, rising from his chair. 'Only one thing is still clouded, madame. We can quite understand your attacks upon Master Jacky. There is a limit to a mother's patience. But how did you dare to leave the child these last two days?'

'I had told Mrs Mason. She knew.'

'Exactly. So I imagined.'
Ferguson was standing by the bed, choking, his hands outstretched and quivering.

'This, I fancy, is the time for our exit, Watson,' said Holmes in a whisper. 'If you will take one elbow of the too faithful Dolores, I will take the other. There, now,' he added, as he closed the door behind him, 'I think we may leave them to settle the rest among themselves.'

I have only one further note in this case. It is the letter which Holmes wrote in final answer to that with which the narrative begins. It ran thus:

BAKER STREET,
Nov. 21st.
Re: Vampires
Sir,
Referring to your letter of the 19th, I beg to state that I have looked into the inquiry of your client, Mr Robert Ferguson, of Ferguson and Muirhead, tea brokers, of Mincing Lane, and that the matter has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion. With thanks for your recommendation,
I am, Sir,

I hop out on him in broad day, like he fit the description
Pure disrespect, while you rappin', I don't really be listenin'
Ya bitch want somethin' dark in her, I swear that Hennessy different
You get ya crew jammed up, I got my blue bands up
I'll put you down when we come in contact like this two hand touch

{Arsonal puts his hands on Cassidy and a scuffle breaks out between the entourages and delays the battle for just over five minutes}

You get ya jammed up, I got my blue bands up
I'll put you down when we come in contact like this two hand touch
Long beak on the bird, bing I let a two can' (toucan) bust
I said ""bing"" cause I didn't wanna say ""BAOW"" and get ya crew amped up
Cause now-a-days a ""BAOW"" is really all it take for the gas to start
I've mastered arts
I say I'm the devil in ya church soon as ya pastor talk
He in waist deep, I kidnap his son at the traffic stop
These punches outta this world, think slap boxin' wit' an astronaut
I remember bein' down bad, I ain't have a lot
Now I got crypto investments in comedy, mean I'm literally the laughin' (laugh in ) stock
Matic pop, let this nigga run for 'bout a half a block
My fourth and inches when I touch down? He ain't gonna make it to see when the next Madden drop
Ya bitch said my disrespect was what keep her wet
We repeat the sex
All you see is her apple on my desk, she the teacher's pet
You think we doin' yoga, downward dog nigga, peep the stretch
Long nose ready to blow, it's time to decongest
I keep a pistol, I shoot you and the bitch eatin' witchu
You come out the mall, I'm hidin' under ya car just to show you the beef official
This ratchet ain't tryin' to [?] no Felicia issues
So think Logic-al when speakin' on them ProTools cause I ain't finna Reason witchu
You got one statistic
You gon' respect mine or ya son'll get it
I'll leave him dead in the middle of Little Philly
But little did he know I overdosed wit' a TEC-9 (Tech-9), no Pun intended
Now let's get personal
Ya youngest son Shane? He got molested and ya brother did it
Shut up nigga! Yes he did and you just discoverin' it
What you tryin' to act unclear as if his uncle didn't
Bitch you can't spell ""unclear"" without puttin' the ""uncle"" in it
I've been #1 for 12 years, how I'm supposed to remain humble wit' it?
Chopper wit' a coolin' can', I'm in the middle of the jungle wit' it
Long hair don't care, and I'm feelin' like Rapunzel wit' it
You got a new born in ya arms? I hit stick, make you fumble wit' it
Torture you while the children there, I hurt your youngest children yeah
I put the recordin' of you beggin' for your life up in his Build A Bear
Make me mad and watch shit start flippin', you'll think Matilda here
This extension is high demand for this ratchet; it's Brazilian hair
Y'all sat him in hot water, like it stays on a silverware
I blend in they tryin' to catch me 'Ridin' Dirty' I'm Chamillionaire
Now when you into guns like I am, you make no mistakes
I got an SR 9C with two safeties but still no one's safe
If got a brush stainless steel slide that's one inch wide I even know the weight and density
And I know you gonna miss ya target if you hold it straight
So I'm ridin' wit' it, I'm shootin' all day, bitch I'm bloggin' wit' it
I hit that fag Cass' then that nigga Chubby Jag and his father wit' it
Then I hit Swizz Beatz non melanin, pale ass noggin' wit' it
Other words, I hit Pinky In The Brain just for ponderin' it
I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your conscious wit' it
Toss it to my man in the back field, he got options wit' it
Obama phone, really came in handy, I lined up wit' it
Cass' said he was a problem so I broken him down to Quantum Physics
Cave man, I go nowhere without the stick, I'm at the doctor wit' it
The baby in WalMart, it's in the cart bitch, I'm shoppin wit' it
Baow! Baow! Baow! I'm feelin' like Waka wit' it
His chest half open and half closed, this body optimistic
I put the baow in battle rap nigga, Ars' wit' the small dreadlocks
Y'all don't remember '09?
Should I yearbook picture a nigga, give him a headshot
Then BAOW to the back of the cranium, then his head pop
And once he hit the ground the Hulkamania Leg Drop
From a BAOW to a BANG BANG BANG, I think I'm Craig pop
Dead lock, Usain Bolt couldn't outrun these red dots
If you really want a nigga to suffer, fuck a headshot
Hit him in his heart, have him grabbin' his chest he lookin' like Red Fox
This will fuck up a disc, but not one that come out a Redbox
Shot him walkin' up the stairs, I shot son, the real definition of step pops
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Round 1: Cassidy]
Y'all niggas hear me?

[Crowd]
Yeeeeeah!

[Cassidy]
Look, I brought this dirty Jersey nigga to Philly because I feel he a clown
Philly the town where it started at so I brought it back
And made bands like Ness, the BX where they started rap
But 2 Raw For The Streets is what started Smack
And who started that?
Philly nigga
Ask Gilly nigga it's all a fact
You in 'The City Of Brotherly Slugs' home of all the gats
When the law make an arrest you take a rest, no cardiac
You ain't got the heart to attack you should have a heart attack
I'm chargin' Smack cause I do a great job, I been the truth, I'm talkin' facts
You just bend the truth and come with straight lies
My little shooters keep it on they waist side
They small but straight ride
Right from the jump they'll bang on you; Nate Rob'
Yo I hate lies, make sure when you talk it's true
Before both my fists just bust both them lips that you talkin' through
Arsonal, let me talk to you
You soft as shit and you fraudin' too
For talkin' shit I oughta just split ya fuckin' dome in two
Actin' hard ain't hard to do
I brought some aluminum for you (foil)
It's beef I fire at ya grill until it barbeque
I got more heart than you and to spark at you it's an issue
Like that big bitch that battle wit' big tits, my shit's O'fficial
I grip the pistol then shots bang
Or Cave ya chest in wit' a bat to get jacked boy (Jakkboy) this how you Roc(k) chains
Remember Jakkboy had on Roc chain?
You got the same rocks in ya chain as that boy, we not the same
Boy I got a aim and a big nose that'll blow through tissue
It's (s)not a game
The steel cold if I unload the pistol, may His soul be witchu
I know B.A.R.S. who you wanna be Ars' that's why you stole those initials
Fuck who rollin' witchu, you never got a person hit
I spray the guns, don't play the drums but know how to work wit' sticks
Bitch you not a thug and you not the plug wit' work to flip
Smack, why you let us connect together? Like cursive writ'?
He a beta, I'ma alpha bet (alphabet) this be a 30 clip
This clown be jumpin' 'round on this stage performin' circus tricks
But I ain't wit' the circus shit I'm merkin' shit
It's not a personal if every person know you ain't gon' research the shit
But every person know he never had no work to flip
So to purchase bricks he workin' shifts
He drove a school bus, y'all could Google search the shit
Bitch, while you was workin' on the cheese bus I used to work wit' swiss (Swizz)
You ain't never work wit' these (D's), bustin' 'til you hurt ya wrist
If you Strapped In wit' a Bigga .9
I brought the strap and it's a bigger .9 than you New (Nu) Jersey niggas Tworkin' wit'
That nigga Suge look like he 'bout to give birth and that nigga Surf a bitch
He get clapped at but never clap back
Smack, you should book Surf and Clips
Cause didn't Surf just get booked wit' a clip?
That shit the perfect fit
And wit' the perfect grip on the Smith & I keep lickin' like a serpent lives
Yo certain shit ain't that deep for real
But certain shit like cheese will leave you six feet deep if I'm knee deep in bills
Yo I sleep wit' steel
Cause I merk cats, make 'em take dirt naps and they never woke up them niggas sleepin' still
For sleepin' on me, I'll spark the weapon like a narcoleptic on sleepin' pills
Y'all fall asleep for real
These battle rappers stay beefin' still
But fake reach for steel and go BAOW! So loud y'all think the beef is real
Bitch, you must don't really brush ya teeth for real
Ew
Get them shits bleeched before they think ya gold teeth a grill
The car where I keep the steel but the V near (veneer)
Sayin' he keep it real is like sayin' Cardi teeth is real

[Arsonal]
The fuck is you rappin' 'bout bruh? What is he rappin' 'bout?

[Cassidy]
Sorry Cardi, I'm a big fan, I shoulda said ""Hitman""
That nigga wear veneers too
Smilin' ear to ear too
For years I used to be buck but I had to straighten up
Just like Cardi B teeth used to be buck but now they straight as fuck
I'm tryin' to shake shit up
But ya ugly ass face keep fuckin' my concentration up
Plus you fake as fuck when I raise 'er (razor) up ya face get cut
They wanna hear (hair) lines you not a barber but shape'n up
You can't be serious (Serius)

{Crowd starts to boo/get restless}

[Smack]
Hold it down. Hold it down. Let him rap. Let's get it. Let's get it

[Cassidy]
It's already 1-0
Listen man, you been confused, lookin' in a tube ya entire life
And on bikes the inner tube is in the tire, right?
Ars', I'll ride 'til the wheels fall off, but you retired (re-tired) twice
Pump ya breaks, chump to be safe you'd probably ride a bike wit' a helmet on it
If I ride ya helmet gone
I clap the gats 'til e'ry shell is gone, we don't ride alike
Will he be able to handle bars or will he die tonight?
My ride is like you might not even make it outside tonight
I swear to God it's like, if the Lord ain't on his side tonight
His soul be rose in the sky tonight
Cause this guy be like, ""My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without puttin' Ars' in it""?
That shit is fake, you just a fraud, that shit is all gimmicks
Ayo my trunk gotta pump, a Drako and a couple AR's in it
So if my dawg runs into cars see Ars' (C-Ars') finished
But don't take it personal pussy, it's all business
And before it's all finished, just admit it I'm dope, bitch I'm the GOAT
Now spit that goofy shit that you wrote
Pussy

[Round 2: Arsonal]

[Arsonal talking]
Oh my God. Oh my God. Let me hit the water one time
That's what I'm sayin'. That's what I'm sayin'. That's what you sayin'. They booin' you tellin' you ""time"" in Philly
[Cassidy] That's ya homie right there
[Arsonal] Maaaaan. Suck my dick pussy!
[Cassidy] He doin' that right now
[Arsonal] All these years....all these years

{Crowd starts to boo loudly and Smack asks the crowd to let him rap.}

[Arsonal]
All these years, now I can see why you was runnin' scared of me
Cause I'm the nigga that's gonna expose you ain't the nigga you appear to be
They told me take my time when writin' for you, pen it carefully
I said, ""Nah fuck that. I'm disrespectful.""
You gonna have to smack ya mother to prepare for me
On the Greyhound from ATL is how I move my weight
And I vowed to never let a fuck nigga remove my plate
And I never lose my faith
Check out at 11:00 y'all was leavin' 6:00 in the mornin' cause them underage bitches had to be to school by 8:00
My belt always a lil' loose to get a handgun drawn
I told you in the Face Off I'll make you watch your mother suck my dick in her grandson room
And then I put you in ya place
I do some more disrespectful shit like, dig in my left nostril then pluck the booger in ya face
Why? Cause I'm a loc, chimney weed, a hookah cigarette, I want all kinda smoke
I'm disrespectful, I'll walk in Kanye house and tell a Yo Mama joke
Fourth grader, hittin' the blunt, watch how this .9'll smoke
Stomp him in some Adidas and now he adios
Do y'all believe in a parallel universe?
(I do)
Kinder folks
Me and his mom was listenin' to his song 'Condom Style' when the condom broke
It's ironic you knock a nigga unconscious then he make conscious quotes
Why provoke? Somethin' out the trunk blew (blue) his whole face, watch me pop a (Papa) Smurf
We don't wanna hear them 2006 bars that you got for Surf
I'll put ya mom to work
Head back, mouth open she tryin' to drive the boat
Introduce him to a Heckler
Why? For thinkin' I'm a joke
I just wanted to talk, give him a pep, see (Pepsi) but he too busy tryin' to find the Coke
I flare 'matics, you reach it'll frighten niggas
This ain't Scare Tactics
Sleepin' on me? Long enough only gonna hurt you like an air mattress
You'll see an arm wave from a distance, think we was practicin' fair catches
Whether it's guns or bitches, we gang bang and we share ratchets
I got Cassidy, ohh, I'm in big man beef
Which require them big choppers, he talkin' Hitman teeth
What?!
But I got a pistol tucked in the linin' of my custom designin'
I light skin wit' bald heads but we got nothin' in common
We experienced different pains
The nigga you starin' at, mama ain't used to miss his games
But I ain't have no father figure for years, I only seen daddy in them picture frames
Every other night, auntie was stickin' different veins
I'm from an era whatever ya parents wish for, and couldn't afford, was how they picked ya name
You still AOL Instant Messaging, we got different A.I.M
When y'all see a nigga wit' the gift of (w)rappin' under a tree, y'all might think Christmas came
See now, the way I structure these bars is the definition of true writin'
I'm a true titan, walkin' through life blindfolded, followin' moon lighting
And Street Fightin' under new Bison
But when I pull out that A.R.?
15 nigga, I don't mean Ab so don't get too frightened
How you Tyson in this ring and they say I move like him?
In battle rap you mic'd in but how you Mike and I'm the one that tie my shoes like him?
Every clip a comma, period I don't use hyphens
Question marks who be talkin' the talk but still they move frightenin'
Now this expands deep
The way these crackers use us niggas and you can't speak
With a voice to inspire yo' people, that don't mean you woke cause you can't sleep
Over the years we both battled cats
But yo' style of battle rap is antique
It's either A. Kill him now
Or peel and get rid of him next day after, that's my Plan B
He want oohs and ahhs for everybody bar and y'all do extra
I've been on cruise control for 12 years, ain't no need to gas the nigga in the Tesla
It's funny, I'll put a Heckler to you heckler
Squeeze, then put a bunch of holes (hoes) in ya man chin (mansion) like Hugh Hefner
My preacher sellin' dope
Your preacher sellin' hope
My preacher sellin' dope
But when you in the position he in it's a sin to crack a smile even tell a joke
I ain't gon' lie y'all I swear to God, this the realest shit I ever wrote
I was a fan nigga
In high school to me you was the man nigga

[Cassidy]
I'm still the man

[Arsonal]
No you not nigga!
You was supposed to progress over the years and your talent didn't expand nigga
I really fucked witchu, I ain't see another level than you
In '03 I fought a nigga for sayin' J-Hood was better than you
But then you bitched up
$50,000, rejected from Mook
That broke my heart, nigga not what I expected from you
Thought you was Cassidy, The Hustla, with split personalities, who get get mo' cheddar
Come to find out he buried Adrian Reese
Some nigga in a 'Hotel' in a B-Boy stance, that's it, it gets no better
You wack!
You wildin'
5002-0?
You stylin'
Every time I hear Cass' verse I think Juvey 'bout to say, ""This for the '99 and the 2000!""
You lost a lot of weight, and you lost to the window of a Chevy
You lost to Goodz, you lost yo' fuckin' mind
That's four L's I count already
But them 5002 battles y'all they ain't all fake
It's just 4,999 of 'em that ain't on tape
See me? I know ya type
Lotta lip on you, you gotta overbite
How you expect to keep up wit' the new era? You was the prototype
I'm an outlaw, but when you livin' in the South, Paw you should know your rights
I sold coke, I got Proof I get Bizarre with that white, boy, bitch I'm Obie Trice
Now I could smack him wit' an open fist then choke his bitch
Then draw on Cass' (cast) but not how high school students treat a broken wrist
I'm on a crash course
I'll pop up in his future and take the mask off
After itchin' for it for six weeks tonight I finally cut Cass' (cast) off
You the type of nigga a bitch say, ""Why you lyin' on her cat?""
How you even expect that pussy was yours when she told you lyin' on her back?
See, I don't trust niggas who miss they target
Here's the proof in that
I got a nigga that's no longer my friend cause he missed the nigga we was shootin' at
I'm Omar Epps as J. Reid I told him, ""Hand me the grip.""
Flew to Philly to walk all over his grass and treat him like he's Stanley and shit
You used to be at the Sixers game actin' like you and Iverson family and shit
He ain't even from Philly, it took a nigga like Meek to bring this city a championship
Nigga, my shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
You can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Round 2: Cassidy]
Off top, if the lead clap, you dare to get your head wrapped
Skull shot, bald spot, you'll never grow ya dreads back
Yo this nigga dead Smack, don't stop the fight
If you Hulk Hogan leg drop tonight the Calicoe pop tonight
He might've missed the punch but I'm quick to punch, so watch the right
If I steal him that shit'll cost me, y'all can copy, right? (copyright)
Dawg, I can box, I'm nice
Watch ya tongue, bitch I'm not the one
You said you ain't no shotgun so I know you never shot a gun
I shot a gun but never got shot wit' one
So what you got a daughter and you love her nigga, fuck her grandfather's son
This nigga daughter prolly stupid cause her father dumb
I saw a pic of her and couldn't tell if he got a daughter or got a son
You never gotta run if you got a strap
My favorite gun I gave to AR and he shot a cat, I never got it back

Yo quiet down man

[Smack]
Y'all gotta hold it down! Let him rap. Please. Please! Please! Hold it down

[Cassidy]
Tretch investin' in U-Dubb but ain't make no profit back
To make ya pockets fat you had to leave that league and rock wit' Smack
It's obvious who make the hotter tracks
Yo platinum might've been ya goal but I'm the one that got a plaque
You battled Charron and grabbed ya phone cause you forgot ya raps
You choked it's true, but if they see me chokin' it's cause I'm chokin' you
He choke a lot
His mom choke on cock, she be chokin' too
How broke is you?
Your house in Miami should have an ocean view
How much coke you do?
I peep you got teeth like a smoker do
This clown was in a Face Off smilin' like how the Joker do

Yo, y'all gotta turn my mic up man

[Smack]
Yo, y'all gotta turn it down

[Cassidy talking]
Let me get some water if I gotta scream for niggas to hear me

[Smack]
Yo hold it down. Let him rap. Let him rap. Let him rap. Let him rap
Let's get it. Hold it down!

[Cassidy brings it back 16 bars]
...But I knew that I was roastin' you cause all I heard was, ""Suck my dick! Suck my dick!""
I said, ""Dang, this fag emotional.""
I'll tell a chick to suck my dick, that's what she's supposed to do
But you would tell a man to suck ya dick and really hope he do
But I ain't come to joke witchu groupie
My life a movie, and I'm castin' actors
Cass' a factor, made a bag off Smack cause Cass' a trapper
The fact Smack booked me twice got you pussies tight
But look it's like I don't really give a fuck; Jaz The Rapper
You know how Jaz The Rapper don't really fuck so I assume her pussy tight
Look, I'm nice I'm not your average rapper
I black out, just ask the crackers
When I aim .9's I aim mine diagonally, so you could die in agony
And bang mine
We losin' when it's game time
Ain't possible dickhead, like tryin' to cum and piss and the same time
I don't bang slime, but can have some niggas touch you nigga, fuck you!
When I throw up some fingers it's not a gang sign
Lame, when it came time I chose a lane
Over change I unload them thangs, get shot in ya face; Novocain
Burn ya body up, then ya body what I'ma throw in flames
Can burn ya body up, it's arson, no remains
Listen, Ars' in no position to front
Know ya name Durrell Jones, you don't load and aim, you talkin' game
It's snakes in the grass but I'm on point like cobra fangs
Squeezin' like a boa constrictor 'til I got shoulder pain
This strap over the shoulder hang when I blam mine
Period
This pussy could fill his holes wit' tampons, I'm serious
I've been plugged in like a landline
And I throw up my hands you just throwin' up hand signs
When the hand .9 by the Jimmy, Jones I Just Blaze
It's a wrap if you owe ('Oh) Boy'; Cam'ron
Listen, I'll cock the Koch, it's a lil' K like ya man Shine
It's light but it sounds so BIG that I call the can' ""Shyne""
This type of disrespect you can't find
I'll make ya damn mom swallow the dick in front of ya grandmom
Fuck ya baby mom in the kitchen a bunch of damn times
Hittin' while ya daughter do dishes, I'm out my damn mind
If you not a fan, fine
But this clearly a decisive win, I got the type of pen that's so dope I could ghost write for Em'
I feel I could go to a gun fight with a knife and win
Until my god decide when my life will end, I'm slicin' skin
Stab you wit' the knife and then
Pull a pipe, aim and put a bullet right in the same hole the knife was in
Bitch, every fist fight I win
But I hate I have to fight a case cause a fake nigga fightin' for his life again
He get prescribed Vicodin and get a metal plate in his jaw so he get the nod if he try to take a flight again
It's simple and plain (plane) I let it fly when the flight come in, the white come in
You slow? Go to Google search and type it in
Yeah I'm nice and slim
Prolly don't believe I can box until you need a doc to give you stitches so the bleedin' can stop
Cause you gon' be bleedin' a lot
One punch to the jaw you sippin' lunch through a straw, regardless if you vegan or not

{Crowd starts to boo}

[Smack]
Yo hold it down. We ain't doin' that shit. I need y'all to be quiet while he's rappin'. Let's get it. Hold it down. Hold it down! Hold it down. Let's get it Cass'. Hold it down. Everybody on the stage. Everybody hold it down. Let's get it Cass'

[Cassidy]
Listen
I got a Calicoe, so right off top I'll have you chumps runnin' out the door like Brizz after the Mook punch
The last few months I've been plannin' this guy body
Cause bodyin' guys is my hobby
My body got a arm/leg/leg/arm/head it's a God body
I swear to God all I fear is Allah so why try me?
Cross me get crucified, why would I lie akhi?
You look like the Predator by prey (pray) on God akhi
They say if you starvin' to death, Christ be the savior?
But to survive akhi, if you was starvin' to death, could rice be the savior?
Yo I know God got me, I show God love but even the haters got God bodied
Time

[Debo]
We gon' turn Cassidy's mic up. Can you hear Cassidy when he rappin'?

[Crowd]
Yeah!

[Debo]
Alright, turn his mic up so he can hear him. Please

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Ayo, this shit is quite clear
You got booed in Philly, right here
This a nightmare
You should've punched me in my face when I tested you and ended the battle right there!
I said, I'm here to snatch every bit of conf-

{Crowd starts chanting 3-0}

I said, I'm here to snatch every bit of confidence from your consciousness
Since you tryin' to convince the world yo' accomplishments, I'm yo consequence
I ain't one you can intimidate what you poppin' shit
My passport look just like yours, I been to them continents
I said I gave back to my city for real I sit wit' the congressmen
I been had an eagle throwin' bullets before Donovan
I had real white boys on Smack before Solomon
I was sendin' Hollows through glass before Jonathan
Now if you so successful musically, why you don't go back to that?
He don't believe me his mother tried to suck dick through an Apple jack
Now if you so successful musically, why you don't go back to that?
Cause you can't
The only check you could generate is through battle rap
That's a Snapple fact
These bars, Drake dissin' Meek they comin' 'Back To Back'
This man? Con', I should sock him in his mouth, bitch I'm Cactus Jack
Soon as the lights go low, nigga that's when the mood change
I walked into Philly as Tity Boi, but I'm goin' home as 2 Chainz
My daddy was State Property before the Philly niggas used it as a group name
And in this sport, you will never pass an Ars'/Lux or Mook name
You changed
In battle rap we still treat you as a new name
But to this faggot ass industry you a lil' higher up the food chain
I'm from Ellis Ave and Hopkins nigga, Grape Street Goon Gang
In '05 I had a 5X white tee with a MAC-11 on a shoestring
Give me a fuckin' reason
Panic attack, he start to rush his breathin'
Last battle he got booed like it was cuffin' season
He talk a good game 'til he get his with A. Smith, but these ain't come from Steven
.357's, .9's, MAC-11's, I'm usin' all odd numbers to get fuckin' even
You are not the villain
Chopper squeelin'
Doctors willin' to fix him then I let somethin' big peel (pill); amoxicillin
I got a gun so big nigga, this the one I'm not concealin'
You got a Bobby Boucher mind, ya brain ain't do the proper healin'
Now go 'head, tap my pockets like you did Goodz if you want
I'ma let you
But what I'm a do back gon' be way more disrespectful
I'm special
Inf' beam on any skin, that's a freckle
That's true, I point this .9 at you (achoo), hope God bless you
I'm Ali great, heard you brought some Bloods to disrespect
I'll throw a BK in they face, KD and Kyrie tape
Back then I was Superbad, I'm talkin' high speed chase
I was 16 wit' a .45 I guess ID fake
I do my dirt alone, fuck a co-defendant
Know ya limits
You talkin' to a nigga who cereal box came wit' the roaches in it
Pain I was soakin' in it
Gang I was soakin' wit' it
Told you I question marks, I let it bang and now he open ended
I can walk around ya hood wit' all my jewelry on, but I choose not to
To avoid havin' to pop who might try to do me wrong
I got a shooter in the car right now wit' the toolie drawn
Since we in Philly and all my friends are dead I choose to walk around wit' my Uzi on
You talkin' ""Bars is back""
Nigga I had bars back when Biggie had a coogi on
What type shit you be on?
I'm still livin' the lyrics from his 'Juicy' song
Police try to call the police on me cause I'm tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter
That's right, cause I'm from Newark, New Jersey, a city where we can't even drink our water
While you was livin' your dream Cass', I was dreamin' to get a Dreamcast
I ain't even have a bed nigga I was sleepin' on a bean bag
While the roaches and the mice was in my room playin' freeze tag
You was on tour nigga, I was on the floor nigga
I'll invite you to the studio
And serve the clip soon as the beat low
He knock, I'm on the other side like
Put yo' eye to the peep hole
I said, when this smoke; bald heads, whole lotta chemo
This nigga stay on the line, he shoot a whole lotta free throws
But drugs ain't the way though
We know, they know
He start to scramble wit' the cheese, he get hit wit' the biscuit wit' the potato
Then he scramble wit' the cheese and I'ma let (omelet) the tre (tray) go
I push the button down on the toaster he brain pop out like an Eggo
I ain't ya Migo nigga
I'll take off on Quavo
No extension, baby .9's, it might Offset the Drako
A Jersey nigga, disrespectin' a Philly nigga
In Philly
Brotherly love is not our thing
But if you such a Philly nigga and you got respect for Philly niggas Why you ain't pop out fiend?
Like, if you really got so much respect for Philly niggas then why ain't you say nothin' to the Meek MIlly nigga about the Philly nigga we all seen knocked out [?]
Now that was a cheap shot...clearly...Tito's vodka
This tiny nigga could never get straight wit' I (eye), ask Debo doctor
I had Cass' lookin' for son like he Nemo father
Bars is back, I treat a mic (Mike) like I'm Tito father
I got my drink and my dutchie
You just beat a murder? People think that you lucky?
Nah nigga, people think that you a custy
But since you was loyal to ya team, in ya mind that's okay
See he startin' think like he Rusy
Trust me, whatever you do, don't touch me
I pull up wit' a stick under the pit, so it's musty
And the pistol sittin' comfy
I put my right hand up to God
My first drive-by was on the two pegs of a honkey
We was teenagers, five bricks, we was trafficin' out the Days Inn
I come from playin' Madden on the street, really tacklin' on the pavement
Made men, e'rybody gripped
Ya bitch gon' dress like a pinata for Halloween cause she let e'rybody hit
I walk in ya front door leave e'rybody hit
Even the family pet
Three rounds all bars, I ain't mention Gilly or no motherfuckin' tranny yet
I ain't even gon' finish my shit
I'ma just do it like this
I know! I know! I hit him wit' a hollow, how low, bullet in him
He runnin' off the stage like he wallow
My shit is real, my shit is raw, my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""bars"" without that ""Ars'"" in it

[Round 3: Cassidy]
When you get a God body he can either can get the fire or six feet of dirt
A service in the [?] or a preacher church
A person that's deceased wit' the crypt keeper first
You can't meet death unless you meet wit' the Grim Reaper first
You know what? I'ma go from ya toe up shoot ya sneakers first
It'll kick and remove ya feet before you lose I'ma defeat (da feet) ya first
At least critique work before you take the stage cause the stakes is raised
You actin' like you want action, I'ma break a leg
Wait I paid a Smack fiend a half bean to have heem, shoot ya in ya calf if I scream the word ""Caffeine"" (calf fiend)
This nigga bitch and drag queen
Fuck the wanna-bes, my gun'll squeeze
And I'll silence the K when I'm dumpin' these (knees)
No cap, this an ultimate rap
I'll run this league
He got four figures they paid me over a 100 G's

{Crowd starts booing}

[Debo]
Hold it down. Hold it down. Please hold it down. Keep goin' Cass'

[Cassidy]
When it come to cheese, the ones that be trappin' witchu, be the ones settin' the trap so somethin' happened witchu
Better keep the police captain witchu
Or they gonna have to try to skin graph ya thong when the ratchet hit you

[Guy from the crowd]
Yo Gilly start rapping!

[Cassidy]
If I clap the pistol, you be cryin' hollerin'
But fuck it, when I bust it, I'm havin' a ball; Iron Solomon
Since I ain't followin' trends I've been convinced
Lames in the game feel my shit is offensive that's why they in defense
The industry is gay in a sense
Cause it's full of dick heads and assholes and ain't no coincidence
Ayo I be convinced
Why you claimin' a Crip block?
A fake Crip could drip real Blood if some shit pop
Cuz will need a blood transfusion he get shot
He'll see blood then see the crypt (Crip) keeper at [?]
My shit got, punch after punch from the rip Aak
And this chump never punch like Clips in his flip flops
When niggas get knocked they start snitchin' like Clips' pop
I got the white and use the same scale as the fish spot
I had ki's (keys), these niggas learn how to pick locks
I'm the kinda rapper, play wit' the D like a linebacker
The kinda trapper spray ya for free I'm a .9 clapper
Hollow through ya stomach will give you a spine fracture
If I stop ya clock I will not do no time after
If I hit my man he not a hitman he a contractor
He keep a gun if you need it done he'll contact ya
Ya get a private call tonight, the target dialed him all night
I knew the little shooter all his life, he like Chess size
But'll tie ya arms up to ya chest and you get chastised (chest ties)
Poke ya throat, cut open ya neck wide
Then use his index and his thumb to pull out ya tongue; Columbian necktie
Alright, well guess why this nigga so afraid
(Why?!)
Cause I'm connected like a unibrow and sneak cats puma style
Ya bro behave like a hoe behave
Get hit wit' the blade in ya shoulder now you got a extra shoulder blade
I'm underrated, but I'm overpaid
Since ya mom gettin' old in age that old hoe need to close her legs
Yo I'm so amazed they let a terrorist in
Who bared arms, I got more guns than the hairs on ya chin
And the ice is in the chain
I'm the nicest in the game
Just put a knife up to ya vein and just tear your wrist in
Despite bein' lame
You supposed to be Crip but don't know the rules of the street
You can lose ya teeth if ya open ya lips
And I heard that you supposedly snitch
Who knows though?
It's not like if you lie we'll suddenly see ya nose grow
Pinocchio
I wish a boy would (wood) lie to me
The toy could get allergies, then a fuckin' long nose blow
I feel, y'all still, can't fuck wit' my old flow
Youngin' I'm on my Benjamin Button you lookin' old tho'
The shotgun got double impact, but I hold it so loooow
So when it kick it lift and hit niggas' foreheads; no homo
I never stop grinidin', I'm rockin' diamonds the gold glow
And I'm prepared to do you greasy in here (hair); Soul Glow
But yo yo, I know you not prepared
Off top you gon' dread this loss Aak
Cause I got it locked in here (hair)
You should drop a tear (tier)
You should've prolly quit
Cause this whole round I broke down how you really supposed to body shit
Nigga you'se a bitch! Gotti shit
See these rounds; Homi shit
You tried to do a Geechi and hide, I shoot the tree down
Bitch I brought a 100 clip, you only came wit' three rounds?
Keep it a 100, you run wit' Crips but you wanna be down
The NFL signed Jay-Z and Meek free now
But these clowns forgot why Kaepernick put his knee down
See now, this round was called ""Body Parts"" cause this the part where you get bodied, you ain't play ya part
It ain't nobody fault
I caught a body, walked and ain't talked or call witness
This a murder yo but it ain't personal it's all business
And before it's all finished
Just admit it, I'm dope bitch I'm the GOAT
And they heard that stupid shit that you wrote

Late December, back in '63
What a very special time for me
As I remember, what a night

Oh, what a night

But I was never gonna be the same
What a lady, what a night

Oh I, got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Oh, what a night
Hypnotizing, mesmerizing me
She was everything I dreamed she'd be
Sweet surrender, what a night

I felt a rush like a rollin’ ball of thunder
Spinnin' my head around n' takin' my body under
Oh, what a night

Oh I, got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room
Oh my, as I recall it ended much too soon

Why'd it take so long to see the light
Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right

387,Playaz Club,"[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-To-Reel
She got a buddy named SP-12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late-night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin' real tight
Somethin' to roll to, somethin' to stroll to
If you's a player in the game this'll hold you
More money, more money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put the salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
Huh, I run my own, and I'm my own self-person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a Playaz Club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town, a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on remote at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
(More champagne, Mr. Forté?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Frankie J, we took an airplane flight
Huh, they wanted to hear a rap, I said ""Alright, bet""
We dropped a beat, I grabbed the mic, and then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket, no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State, and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out, 4-Tay's out-rappable
Don't need a Glock, but I bought one just in case
A sucka try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Know the chase is on, because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap, you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way, just in case you never heard of Rappin' 4-Tay
I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' on them suckas poppin' off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank, bro
Leave the gat at the house, bring some dominoes
Kick off your shoes, relax, and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin' at these women at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it, but don't get it twisted
VIP, that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout
And how you carry yourself; now homie, what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G.'s
Some got a nine-to-five, some took a lot of kis
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme-sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss Goody Two-Shoe, I'll see you later
I ain't got time, you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show, another flow, a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership, but never slip to lameness fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground, and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

[Chorus]
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it in the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
Me and my homies, we're tighter than a glove
We chop a lot of game, that's how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool, or kick it in the tub
'Cause we kick much ass at the Sucka-free Club

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
Huh, what about that one they got in Philly, Fo'?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
You understand, shit; Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs
Closer to home, like Seattle, L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shout goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least, yeah
Them Playa Clubs they got right there in the
San Francisco mothafuckin' bay, yeah
Where your Playaz Club at 4?
My Playaz Club right in the heart of Fillmo'e

Another day, I call and never speak
And you would say nothing's changed at all
And I can't feel much hope for anything
If I won't be there to catch you if you fall

[Chorus]
Again (We fail)
It seems we meet (To meet and mend)
In the spaces (Spaces safe)
In between (Between intents)
We always say (Say too much)
It won't be long (Long been gone)
Oh, but something's always wrong

[Verse 2]
Another game of putting things aside
As if we'll come back to them some time
A brace of hopes, a pride of innocents
And you would say something has gone wrong

[Chorus]
Again (We fail)
It seems we meet (To make amends)
In the spaces (And wend our way)
In between (Between intent)
We always say (Looking back)
It won't be long (Not moving on)

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin or light skin black
The type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down, she's my sexy souffle (Hey)
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work
If you try to disrespect ya mess around and get ya feelings hurt
She ain't pressed from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip but when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight dinners from her man
But she's a trooper if she has to she'll eat beans from the can
A very nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I like it
Yeah, my black coffee

[Hook]

Black coffee gotta fit like a mitten
Roars like a lion when I stroke her kitten
Versatile, wears the Colgate smile
She got the piles of style, ain't had none in a while
Party animal, but dig it, only when she's with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew, she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy hair, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than (her mom?) but don't touch her
Pretty skirt, you know the ones with the slit
A closet full of gear so you know she stay dipped
Body all smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some ol' sex potion
A nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I want her
Yeah, my black coffee

Part of the Afro-American dream

Appreciate the fact that you never miss a step
The backbone of the black home, here's to ya

Strike the right chord, and I rap, rap my skull cap
Electric, until I blow my top off
I wrap my lyrics right around the globe
I lay lobes and all
Bit by bit I make it fit
Cause I'm here to knit myself together
And whatever split for my format
And after that
I never stay the same
And treat the freak like a doormat
Jump around on it
I'm here to spray poetic confetti already
Open open open up your skull cap

Welcome to my brain, I got the lid off
My chest I got my nut off
The type of spirit that can break your framework
The same by the end will stay the same
Hear the voice of summer
Zow za zow zow
But once I gotta hum a melody
That represents the type of flow I kick
When my tongue is swingin' like a drumstick
Of a jazzy type of lick
Everybody's got the lid on tightly
Afraid of what might be lurking right behind
And out of safety
So undo yourself and watch my rhyme go
Out of my lyrical chimney
But don't repeat my voice to the beat

When you hear the track again make up your own words
Cause the rhythm is a conduit to break a split from the homegrown
The well known is on to the unknown
See everyone's a firecracker like a phone about to get hooked up
And let look up and let look up and let whatever bubbles up
Out your head spread the vibes and illuminate the sky

Cause it's lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
It's Lucas with the lid off
Come on and take your lid off

Watch this
Watch me now you hear me now

Take a solo , take a solo
And spread the vibes kid

I hear that funky tune
Now now now now

397,Only One Road,"[Verse 1]
I'm looking back through the years
Down this highway
Memories; they all lead up to this one day
And many dreams lost along the way
Haunt me still
I guess they always will
When love was too much to bear
I just left it there
Here I stand face to face
With this heart of mine
Livin' without you I only fall behind
We had a love most people never find
All this time
I never realized
And the courage I finally found
Has made me turn around

[Chorus]
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me

[Verse 2]
I can still hear the song of your laughter
I can still taste the sorrow of your tears
We said ""Goodbye"", but our hearts did not hear
Now, my love, there's nothing left to fear
With all my heart put me through
It leads me back to you

[Chorus]
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here
Beside me
There is only one road I'm walkin'
Only one lifetime
One heart to guide me
Only one road I'm walkin'
But I'm gonna run back
I'm gonna run back
'Cause I need you right here

I'm gonna run back

398,Biological Didn't Bother,"Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Hook]
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)

[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so don't even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

400,Far Behind,"Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway

And then maybe some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway

And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall down to the ground

And then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known

And then maybe we might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone

And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no

Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my lord
See I know
See I know

But maybe, said maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway, sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
Now I've said, but times have changed
Your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer, yeah they hold you down, hold on down
Now I said maybe, maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind",Candlebox,1995,"[50, 49, 46, 51]",4

Don't worry about making me have an orgasm
Just take your time and do it with enthusiasm
I can tell it's making you scared just thinking of it

Yeahhh
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uhh
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh

[Verse]
Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, ""Hey bitches!""
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it

[Outro - Drake]

Little Brother
Pooh, 'Te

Just lemme live man
It's all I ask
Here I go",Drake,1995,"[99, 90, 91, 72]",4

My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's bright
My first love

You're every step I make

408,Out Of Tears,"[Verse 1]
A year ago today, oh, nothing was the same
And I was sure it was too late
Thought I was a goner, dusty and downtrodden
Too forgotten to forsake

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you ever made a great mistake?
Have you ever made a great escape?
Oh, you turned me all around
Till I thought that up was down
When you lied so slyly to my face

[Chorus]
I'm not your baby, you did forsake me
And made me crazy for seven years
With all your lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears

[Verse 2]
The dalliances build up till they leave you dumbstruck
And suddenly you're deaf and blind
You learn to love your jailer, learn to be failure
In the prison of your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Till you're walkin' seven steps behind
Till there's something missing in your eyes
Then you turn it all around
And you see that up is down
And it's only in the nick of time

[Chorus]
I'm not your baby, you did forsake me
And made me crazy for seven years
With all your lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears

[Bridge]
One for my dignity
Two for my sanity
Three for autonomy
Four for my time
Five for my arrogance
Six for my laziness
Wait, I'm accountable
Seven for my crimes
And when I said, ""it's you, not me
It's me, not you,"" I meant, you see

[Chorus]
I'm no one's baby, and no one made me
But I went crazy for seven years
With all my lyin', did too much cryin'
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears
Looks like these eyes are all out of tears",Z Berg,1995,"[98, 94, 92]",3
409,Supernova,"[Verse 1]
I feel like Atlas, I got my back stressed
You wanna grab this, you don't understand this
I keep it oppressed, work on my realness
Reading my manifest, I'll address your request

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waking up drenched in sweat
All my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)
I keep hearing what my mother said
Eyes are open, all I see is red

[Chorus]
I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova
I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova

[Verse 2]
Look overhead at the stars and the ocean
Foggy emotions, moments, erosion
This supernova could cause a commotion
My minds of the notion, you'll still be my motive
I've been, I've been so fucked in my head
I've been going through phases, I'm just going through phases
Don't know what this craze is
When's the last time someone said shit? (ohhh)
Walking through your mazes
When's the last time someone meant it? (ohhh)

I've been waking up drenched in sweat
All my dreams, full of my regret (my regret)
I keep hearing what my mother said

I met you in California
You told me you loved him in Georgia
Your heart's in the ground, frozen over
My heart's in the sky, supernova

410,Pickup Man,"Well, I got my first truck when I was three
Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
There's something women like about a pickup man

When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruising the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecoming queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
Cause there's something women like about a pickup man

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man

A bucket of rust or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a pickup man
Yeah, there's something women like about a pickup man",Joe Diffie,1995,"[100, 79, 60]",3
411,At Your Best (You Are Love),"[Verse 1]
When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
If you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Verse 2]
When you feel what you feel
It's hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place before this love affair began
But if you feel more like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about

[Chorus]
But at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Love

[Bridge]
(Wait, waiting)
Let me know
You niggas goin' in
Tell me what it is (Fuck it)
What it is, no need to make believe
Look beyond your world
Try to find, find a place for me

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're at your best you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, know
Love

Stay at your best baby
Let me know, let me know",Frank Ocean,1995,"[67, 69]",2
412,Fade Into You,"[Verse 1]
I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there

[Chorus]
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

[Verse 2]
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

[Chorus]
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
I think it's strange you never knew",Mazzy Star,1995,"[70, 79]",2

[Verse 1: Retrospect]
Yo, I had this illmatic chick who would represent well
She had a New York state of mind and it wasn't hard to tell
She said guard your skill she was the most supportive
Until I caught her cheating with some nigga named Jordan
Life's a bitch and then you die that's why
I had to cut her off because I didn't half time
In the past I've been through different situations
Dominicans and Haitians, even Indians and Jamaicans
There was this common chick that just moved from California
But I thought she was a fiend 'cause she was always on the corner
She didn't know what love was or how to be faithful
She was mad I let her know, so I had to let her go
It was written on the note, but she didn't get the message
She didn't get to stepping, so I had to get the weapon
I told she could take it in writing or she could take it in blood
If you don't leave I'll put your face to the rug
Face it your done, when I found you was a crumb in the slums
I made you chowder, I gave you power
But I ain't sweating it son, 'cause that there is gone
Yo she was just a black girl lost, word up

[Dialogue: Retrospect & Slow V]
(S) Yea, ha
(R) Yo man, I've had a lot of CD's on my deck
(S) I heard that nigga
(R) For real
But I know I ain't the only one with some crazy stories
(S) Nah man, I treat hoes like a radio nigga
Turn them on and blow a hole though them like a speaker of something
(R) Word
(S) Yea, yo but check it

[Verse 2: Slow V]
My first girl was big, and she was ready to die
She had suicidal thoughts, and was a friend of mine
Warning, the doctor gave her, one more chance
Juicy, it's unbelievable that things done changed
Me and my bitch were set we had mad Respect
Lived that Everyday Struggle but would always connect
She would call me big poppa right before I'd shoot
But I had to bounce when she said give me the loot
My second chick was fine she lived a Beautiful Struggle
She had black girl pain, so we would always cuddle
She saw me at the game, at the park, around my way
Going hard in that Ghetto Snow, I con a date
As time went by, I found out she never been in love, apart from me
Chick was really jock-ing me couldn't work it out
Chick was really stalking me with broken glass so I said back up off of me
My third chick was Tical she had a PLO Style
Once the Stimulation hit man I drove her wild
She was all I need with her round Biscuits fastened
Drove her something crazy when I had my thing in action
And there it is, yea

[Dialogue: Slow V & Retrospect]
(S):  yo retro, what's the deal son. Yo man, I hit bitches like singles nigga
(R): What the Fuck

(R): Ha, bitch nigga whatever man

And then I throw them back on the self nigga, ha ha
(R): Ha, and if that bitch ain't raw, if she ain't no classic
Like you just said I put that bitch back on the self
(S): and there it is Nigga
(R): For real nigga CD's
(S): S R nigga
(R): Crazy Dates",Slow V,1995,[63],1
418,But It's Alright,"You don't know
How I feel

You always try
To bring me down

Oh, but I know, girl

You
Are surely, surely gonna pay, girl

But it's all right

419,The Santa Claus Boogie,"Well I don't know, But I've been told
There's something goin' on at the North Pole
Santa and his elves at a factory
Dancin' around the world's biggest Christmas tree

They're doin' the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus

My uncle Henry's got a bad back
When he tries to walk, you hear him pop and crack
But at Christmas time, the spirit sets him free
He jumps and hollers...
Doin' the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus

I knew an indian girl...
She was way too young
She liked to talk dirty in her native tongue
You've never seen nobody shake and shimmy
Like an indian dancer doin' the Santa Claus boogie

It's the Santa Claus boogie
It's the Santa Claus boogie
You've got to take some time to believe in Santa Claus",The Tractors,1995,[91],1
420,Missing You,"[Produced by Thomas Foolery]

[Intro]
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas

[Verse]
That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

[Outro]
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And now for something completely different
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you
I been hoping that I find you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
In the real world, these just people with ideas
In the real world, these just people with ideas
I'm missing you
In the real world, these just people with ideas",Chance the Rapper,1995,[98],1
421,Picture Postcards From L.A.,"I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star
She swears she's gonna make it, make it big someday
And she'll send me picture postcards from L.A

When it's time for closing, I play while Rachel cleans
She listens to my music, I listen to her dreams
She swears she's gonna make it, she's going all the way
And I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

When Rachel shares my pillow she always asks me things
Like do I really think she's pretty, do I like the way she sings?
I don't know how to answer, so I always smile and say
I say, ""Send me picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

Sometimes Rachel stands up in the middle of the bar
And does a scene from the late show
We all clap our hands as she puts her apron on
And says, ""Next week, I'm gonna go.""

She'll even buy a ticket and pack her things to leave
Though we all know the story we pretend that we believe
But something always comes up, something always makes her stay
And still no picture postcards from L.A

""Send me postcards from L.A. signed with love forevermore
Picture postcards from L.A. to hang on my refrigerator door
Rachel, if you find me one, I'd love a picture of the California sun""

I'm the piano player down at Eddie's bar
And Rachel she's the waitress who wants to be a star",Joshua Kadison,1995,[100],1
