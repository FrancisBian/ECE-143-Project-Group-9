0,Un-Break My Heart,"[Verse 1]
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

[Chorus]
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

[Verse 2]
Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

[Chorus]
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart

[Bridge]
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

[Chorus]
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many, many nights
Oh un-break my

[Post-Chorus]
Un-break my heart oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart, sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on

[Outro]
Say that you love me, say that you love me
Tell me you love me, un-break my heart
Say that you love me, say that you love me
Tell me you love me, un-break my heart
Say that you love me, say that you love me
Tell me you love me, un-break my heart
Say that you love me, say that you love me
Tell me you love me, un-break my heart",Toni Braxton,1996,"[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 9, 22]",10
1,"I Believe I Can Fly (From ""Space Jam"")","[Intro]
You know
Even when I feel like trash
Or see people struggling with cash
I realize I'm still here
So I'm thankful...
You know what I'm sayin'?

[Verse 1]
I'm just a small kid, from a small town
The weather there was good, I never had a frown
Right next to the beach, I could here the ocean
The message in the bottle? My bottled emotions
No big hustle, life was no struggle
Somehow I felt like a small fry in a puddle
Sky is blue, look at the clouds
All I wanna do is make my mom proud
Fill dad with pride, I say this out loud
""Life is happening because of family""
Friendship is fishing; don't catch and release
I capture and keep them, true friends till the end
Life ain't what it seems but we shouldn't pretend
That we know all of her, it be too simple then
Look at those who love you, nothing to fear
If no one says this, well I'm thankful you're here

[Chorus]
I wanna thank you
(For everything that you do)
I wanna thank you
(Because you have a choice, you don't have to be here)
I wanna thank you
(I'm about the love, I'm fighting against fear)
I wanna thank you
(I'll try to be clear, I'm glad that you're here)

[Verse 2]
It's the year 92, born to speak to you
Just another baby whose first lady's his mom
Innocent and young, clear like the sky
I pick myself up even though I cry
You may not care if I speak of myself
But I show you one place to get you somewhere else
My life is my advice, the right kind of help
Loving girls, with or without what's under my belt
These troubles in the world, make you wanna hurl
This stress today makes me wanna go away
But hey, say this to you boys and girls
That I always find another reason to live another day
Goodshie awkward feelings or high on life
Space Jam, I believe I can fly all night
""That's great man, but peace is a fantasy""
Well then it's up to us to make it a reality

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Just a man and iron suit, when you boil it down
Fundamentally fresh, so I can't spoil it now
I catch myself asking ""Why?"" then the wind blows
It's telling me to fly, I have to let go
All my worries, all my fears
Locked in my chest, my heart's still here
Beating like the time I asked that girl out
I was probably too scared to go back to her house
Memories resurface, gotta pull the curtains
Focus on the present that I now for certain
Yeah, ""learn from the past"" blah blah blah the future
But I'm not a rookie, my flows are like fortune cookies
Uh, could have done better yesterday
But I'm all about the Now, Yes Today
No clouds of doubt, I say this real clear
Looking at the sky, I'm glad that I'm here

[Chorus]",Wade,1996,"[2, 2, 26]",3
2,Don't Let Go (Love),"[Intro]
Huhhh uhh yeah yeahh yeahh
Oohhh oohh oohh oohh oohh
Huhhh uhh uhhhhh
Hehhhh ehhhhh ehhhhhhhh ehhhhhh ehhhhh

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Verse 1]
I often tell myself that we could be
More than just friends
I know you think that if we move too soon
It would all end
I live in misery when you're not around (round round)
And I won't be satisfied till we're taking those vows

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Verse 2]
I often fantasize the stars above
Are watching you
They know my heart and speak to yours like only lovers do
If I could wear your clothes
I'd pretend I was you
And lose control

[Pre-Chorus]
There'll be some lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking
Oh, lovemaking, heartbreaking, soul shaking

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Verse 3]
Running in and out my life
Has got me so confused
You gotta make the sacrifice
Somebody's got to choose
We can make it if we try, for the sake of you and I
Together we can make it right

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Bridge]
You've got the right to lose control
Don't let go
Don't let go 'cause I can't pretend

[Chorus]
What's it gonna be 'cause I can't pretend?
Don't you wanna be more than friends?
Hold me tight and don't let go (Don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (Don't let go)

[Outro]
What's it gonna be?
Don't let go
Don't let go
Don't you wanna be?
Don't let go

3,No Diggity,"[Intro]
No diggity!
You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt
Play on playette, play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me, collab' creations, bump like acne
No doubt, I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch, a dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre makin' moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much grounds, got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind (wow)
I think about the girl all the time (wow wow)
East side to the west side
Pushin' phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash, stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win?

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up, girl
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

[Verse 3: Blackstreet]
She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound
Baby never act wild, very low key on the profile
Catchin' feelings is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Hook]
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, oh yeah

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, get up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo, that girl looks good)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Play on, play on, play on)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (You're my kind of girl)
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (Hey yo)

[Verse 4: Queen Pen]
'Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flyin' first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me? Not a motherfuckin' thing
Cartier wooden frames sported by my shorty
As for me, icy gleaming pinkie diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake-ass broads?
I shows and proves, no doubt, I been diggin' you so
Please excuse, if I come across rude, that's just me
And that's how the playette's got to be
Stay kickin' game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I be sending the call, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

[Hook]
No diggity, no doubt baby
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Girl, you got it going on)
I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Play on, play on, play on)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hey, ooh)
(Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo) I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up (Hell, yeah, babe)

[Outro]
Yeah, come on
Maggie in full effect
Lisa in full effect (right)
Biggie in full effect (uh huh)
Tamika in full effect (yeah)
Blaze in full effect (right)
Ain't nothin' goin' on but the rent (no doubt)

Yeah, play on, playette

Play on (play on) play on (play on)
'Cause I like it (right)
No diggity, no doubt

4,Nobody,"[Produced by Diddy]

[Intro: Diddy]
You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Interlude: Diddy]
You fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas? What the fuck is their culture? Where the fuck is their souls at? What defines you? These niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces. You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga? Make up your goddamn mind

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Outro: Diddy]
Fuck, y'all wanna talk about fuckin' jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's and fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls and fuckin' mansions niggas ain't got. Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fuckin' staff, nigga. You gotta tell the truth, man. The truth'll set you free, son, the truth will set you free",Rick Ross,1996,"[5, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 10, 11, 11, 13, 24, 37]",13

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Verse 2]
It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

[Interlude]
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)
(Go for the moon)

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars

[Verse 3]
Somebody once asked
Could I spare some change for gas?
""I need to get myself away from this place""
I said, ""Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change""

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow

[Chorus]
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold

6,"I Believe In You And Me (From ""The Preacher's Wife"")","[Round 1: DNA]
I said, last time I was out here was Blackout 5
And for a while, I was telling Organik I ain't think that was fair
Considering I been in some of the biggest battles in this league and would've had the chain if niggas wasn't acting scared
But I did lose to Illmac 'cause I ain't have my raps prepared, excuses too wack to share
But all them Mac problems just made a nigga from the Apple care
Now I'm back, the fans say, ""Take a break""
I say, switch the flow, change the pace
He thought shit was norm’ and found out son a killer: I ain’t with Bates
He searched for the great escape
Thought the venue’s the safest place
But I’ll still sneak a star on the side: Bathing Apes
I don’t care if sir pen in his bag: Jake the Snake
I’ll share a couple points like great debates
The last dude ain’t make the plate
Fast food, let’s put it at Steak n’ Shake
A man’ll be prey with the mill’, so say your grace
Your combinations ain’t safe with me
He thought he got Deal and caught 30: now they yelling, “Take the plea!”
I got the ratchet-
I got the Roscoe on set: Jermaine Dupri
If that’s your girl, make ‘em leave
Or find a cookie on your BM: Baby D’
I’m in his crib, Kaepernick: I’m ‘bout to take a knee
Bring a end to his clique, then send him a clip before A.M., see
Y’all got DNA backwards trying to match A n’ D
The first 48 gon’ be a cold case if y’all see A & E
I’m into all type-
Let’s WORK!
I’m into all types of shit
My mind is sick
I’ll left-right his shit
Then a knife get licked inside his hip
And bet I won’t strike in the same place like when lightning hit!
His jaw I’ll double-tap like I liked the pic
Then make him bolt with the cannon: that’s a pirate ship
He don’t want the smoke, like he trying to quit
All that climbing amount to nothing: that’s a hiking trip
Every rhyme legit
Your squad dying quick
I made sure Ward family ran from this iron fist
I don’t need the hype
I don’t believe he nice
I’ll split his shit, then give him tips like he need advice
No adobo, you ain’t seasoned right
If he would cross me, Jesus Christ
Whoever you wit’ needs a bodyguard: I’m coming for you and the preacher’s wife
All them sleepless nights, it fucked with my mental, Ward
If I said something, it wasn’t by mistake, it’s ‘cause I meant to, Ward
Seeing dead bodies: that’s the type of shit I’m into, Ward
Hit you, then your men, too, Ward
Then peel with the arms over the body like a mental ward!
I get to checking Ward
I never been a friend of Ward
You gon’ need help from New Orleans by the 2nd, Ward!
I could say it forward or backward: either way, I’m ending Ward
Forward, backwards, they both end in “ward”
‘Cause in this first round, I just brought an end to Ward!

[Round 1: A. Ward]
He said he’d hit me twice like he liked the pic
Why it gotta come to this?
You wanna put the hands up.  Why?
It is like when Kaepernick take a knee, ‘cause I saw you and Chess and, all a sudden, you became a stand-up guy!
You see, battle rap is falling off, and I feel it’s time something is said
It’s lost its rawness, that emotion
Some would argue that it’s done for, it’s dead
These veterans, they don’t perfect they craft
They no longer have the hunger, the edge
And I got in it ‘cause of how you used to be
So, every battle, consider me gluten-free…one of the few left that don’t come for the bread!
WHY WAIT!?
Saga hit my phone like, “A., you worried ‘bout what D pens?”
I said, “It depends.”
Honestly, I feel it, too, deep in
And, Eric, you done lost your noodle if you think any of your dog paddles survive in this deep end
You’re in trouble with this number two: you need Depends!
So, was this matchup music to my ears?  Of course…Sweet Chin!
This a disgrace
Because, talent-wise, it is Sweet Chin Music
I feel it’s a step back…a knee-slapper…a kick in the face!
Bro, my plan for you is effortless
So, be cool, minimize the slander in your rhetoric
We don't need you
You’re a cancer to the betterment
I speak truth, the fans deserve better
It's egregious, you never give a top-notch effort
So, they sent me to destroy DNA like I tampered with the evidence!
Let’s talk about it
My king, he died on that big T
Eternal life was the care package
Now it’s official, rain or shine, so the twin Glocks you wouldn’t dare clap it
From Queens to Sauga (Saga) City, I get you drug out the room like DARE classes
I’m praying this top-tier came full of bars, ‘cause I ain’t blow up to get slept on like an air mattress
Now I know a lot of y’all probably caught the NWX members, but there was more to the rhyme
DNA’s double-stranded, so I also schemed, king, queen, twin, full, and air mattress to show how every head bored of your lines!
Bro, you battle every two weeks
Ain’t nobody put you on salary yet?
Of course not, ‘cause the wages you really earned was a reality check!
“PG Killer”?  Even your slogan is straight trash
Who brags about beating opponents that are supposed to be under their weight class?
Not me: I’m in the pit, where darkness stretches like limo tint
To show people with broken pain how to get they window fixed
You got religious questions?  Cool
Just don’t get loud on a crescendo tip
The game don’t stop here
We could take it outside like Nintendo Switch!
So, back down or stay in the background
‘Cause I’m here for a vision, impact crowds
You’re here for attention: a class clown
Make a decision: take pride in your craft now, or retire
‘Cause it’s jacked up you will take a nail in this blowout
But rather than live with despair, I could teach you how to fix a flat round!
I’m that nice!
They told me D hot
Watch out, he squeeze Glocks
I’m not ready, he’s not
Stop now, I overlap, a pot belly
If D talks a clean body, weaned off the Ox heavy
If we box, I’d tee off, bebop, then rock steady!
At the end of the day, when the dust clears, one thing remains, and it’s true
It took you 100 battles to get me…only took me eight to get you!

[Round 2: DNA]
I said, Blackout 7, the fans on the Internet should love this
But I bet the ones on the curb got bored
‘Cause I told Organik I wanted A…Verb, not Ward
Now everybody look confused like, “What I got in the Third? Not sure”
But in the Second, at any second, I bet the church may call
‘Cause they on to you, it’s the same tactics
He ain’t practice
On Friday, it’s fake gun gestures
On Sunday, it’s Saint Baptist
I never seen a great pastor tread the fine line on how he spray ratchets
But never let his four point: oh, this nigga A average!
He straight wack
Besides the Christian gimmick, that’s straight facts
Or we could get it shaking with the pound: that’s JayBlac
112, Diddy: he finna take that
Danny Myers: y’all gon’ see a bald head going through A hat
He gon’ learn, when I’m rappin’, I'mma hurt him with passion
The reward was death, so that earnt him a casket
Not with the snitching
If the phone tapped, the whole curb get to spazzin’
I’ll give A. Z’s
Queens niggas been about affirmative action
You cool with Saga? Just ‘cause you a friend that’s a friend of me don’t make you a friend of me
Blackout 7, but you won’t be the end of me
I ain’t feeling his energy
Let me guess, when you was a young buck, you turned to Christ ‘cause you saw him selling for ten a key
No, you were a nerd named Aaron Ward, from Knoxville, Tennessee!
But I’m on the same shit, different day
I’ll put his clique away, then watch him spin with the fade
You think I’m kiddin’? Play!
Fif’ a K, or I could just let the milli’ spray
I’mma have bullets run in Aaron like a busy day
Every bar is hot
They waiting for it like a barber shop
But I’m on it: I want the static, whether the problem solved or not
I’m keeping clips, then squeeze between the whips: parking spot
Nick' on the backstreet, I give Aaron car the pop
It’s NWX: we ain’t a crew, we fam
Shine showed him the deuce, he ran
It’s no biggie, a pair’ll rock him like the Coogi brand
If I’m getting to his team, and the toolie jam
Then it’s to the mystery machine: that’s Scooby’s van!
Leg shot, he paralyzed: can’t move or stand
Now, they praying for the kid knees (kidneys) like a Boosie fan
I’ll get this dude homi'd: he’ll find God if I use the can
Or I’mma get a new body behind bars: Gucci Mane!
It’s time to see what the rap ‘bout
Tap out, or these’ll let four ring like we in Shaq’s house
He had clout, but then took a wack route
These hammers Verb and Caustic: they known to back out on Blackout
It’s no way you gon’ beat me, nigga
And even though you ain’t a PG nigga
You just lost Round Two to the PG Killa
Time

Well, I say, King of the Dot, make some noise!
You’re right, I’m from Knoxville, Tennessee
But you don’t know nothing about the path I been through
I was raised on Section 8
Every year, we took a coupon to a spot where they passed out gym shoes
So, missed me with all that struggle talk, ‘cause that’s not what I brought to the Blackout venue
However, I grew up with lines, rapping around the block
Why you think I’m so comfortable in a packed-out venue?
I swear this ain’t the action you want
I sacrifice to get my point across, like having to bunt
But not you, nah
Current event bar, Christian joke, sports jersey number attached to the pump
Let’s not forget about the other MAC in the trunk with the clip longer than Chipotle traffic at lunch
It’s so boring!
Miss me with them boring setups
“Something, something, holdin’ the nine”
You had 24 battles last year and no quotable lines
It’s like sleeping in on Clips’ couch how I’m holding it down
I pull strings, lights out: I’ll lower your blinds!
But for a second, forget about the crowd, and let’s just talk, DNA
I figured, since this is between D & A, we should probably abbreviate
See, this award you accepted, it wasn’t for the VMAs
You got it confused
In a hospital room - you not seein' A. (CNA)
This not your life, stop being fake
For a brand, why do you let a dark spirit control you like E & J?
You getting smacked down in this ring
You not raw! You more TNA
But you out here letting the heater spray
Shells hitting the ground like Easter eggs
But when Chess pressed you on stage, you seemed afraid
Where was the toy!?
When the round stopped, you ducked noise like a See n’ Say!
Bro, why you up here battling me?
That thought of Lyt had you seeking shade?
Speaking of Davonne, hey, bro, you can chill with the blaspheming ways
Or catch this 30, Day, fast like you need a plate
This hunger, Eric! Maybe you not getting the message
You should be amazed
But you not making it to Saturday night, live like Tina Fey
The rounds going over your head: we playing keep-away!
Re-arranged the game
I stepped in, kept the breathing straight
All without conforming material, keeping peace and grace
Persevering through the comments, trolls, bloggers, and even saints
To stand BOLDLY on a stage with NO FILLER, just heat for days
In front of you on pay-per-view, with a shirt on that says, “Jesus Saves”!
So, go ahead and curse the movement!  Charge up with it!
You told Loso you both believe in God
This is persecution to worship music
I guess we just lift our arms up different
That’s Round 2!

[Round 3: DNA]
Yo!
I like that your shirt says, “Jesus Saves”, but I see a lot of chinks in your armor
It’s time I show y’all that this kid’s an actor
‘Cause why would you join a group called Yellow Tape Gang when you a Christian rapper?
Usually, yellow tape comes after the murder
Now, I ain’t saying you ain’t with the right team
But I think them niggas made you part of their group so you could be the one that has to pray at the crime scene
Like, “Dear Heavenly Father, I hope 100 Bulletz has 100 bullets with a nice beam
I hope NuBorn throws enough punches to make this fight mean
I hope Bonnie’s on Wild n’ Out, but she’s on a dyke team
And Mike P throws enough Hadoukens to make a nice scheme.""
But you beyond fraudulent, but it’s no reason to hate you
‘Cause you fell into my trap, and I needed an angle
The fans doubted, they ain’t believe I could take you
I got at him to even son out so y’all could see that I’m able!
I ain’t speak first, then my research was reading the fables
The Last Supper, but with this mill’, I ain’t trying to eat at the table
You think Mike P’s your boy!?  It’s too easy to slay you
It’s in the Bible: I’m just waiting on P to betray you!
See, you claim you Jesus, son, but your hand gestures say you keep a gun
But all y’all Christians say it ain’t the same
I just feel like if your drive’s for HOV, then stop changing lanes
You treading a fine line
Go full-force and make a change
So, from here on out, don’t use God’s name in vain!
Just ‘cause I don’t say I’m Christian, I believe in God
Let’s set the record straight
‘Cause God was there when my mom got abused in a domestic state
Daddy died, we both was on SSI and Section 8
But when you deal with something love handles, you carry extra weight!
Y’all all say y’all Christian, but y’all milli-grippin’: it’s extra fake
You don’t get a pass for putting bucks in a round: this ain’t the collection plate
Just ‘cause you know the rule-maker don’t mean you can legislate
It be these type of niggas that get denied at Heaven’s Gates
And it’s time I school him, from start to finish
You got 100 bars a minute, but your whole style says you a clone: it ain’t hard to mimic
I’m the Gatekeeper, have to give y’all a visit
Hashtagging you Christian with shirts: you think God’s a gimmick
You preach the Word, I keep my word: our sponsors different!
LET’S WORK!  LET’S WORK!
All them verses from the Exodus, but can’t bring the X of this: our bars is different!
You wait ‘til Sunday, I can’t wait to son Day: our job is different
You pray with your Pops, I see prey with my pops: our fathers different!
I ain’t the same rappin’!
Ego got me in the game spazzin’
So, pride’ll make sure I’m Gucci: I do nothing in the same fashion
You, Loso, Street Hymns: think y’all cool with great passion?
Y’all keep thinking these Christians united, until I plain drag ‘em!
It’s Round 3, it’s getting hot in here
Canada, y’all know my slogan
(GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!)
Hell no, get this wannabe actor the fuck outta here!
Get this Christian so-called rapper the fuck outta here!
Get all them lines that ain’t matter the fuck outta here!
And I seen that impersonation on Instagram: get Dizaster the fuck outta here!

[Round 3: A. Ward + DNA]
I don’t think y’all realize how easy that is
“We talk about cells different, I dial different
We run a different race, I walk miles with it""
I get on here and rap, and I smile different
(*laughs*)
Eric St. John, it’s finna get even more ruthless
And the exit? It’s over there if you need to go, bro
‘Cause you just not tight as me
View-wise, you do numbers
But, once they put that mic around my collar, I said, “Forget promo!”
Like, Organik, find us some judges
‘Cause when I say a bar, accent and all, they like, “A. must be cooking!  Geez!”
And mark my words: Cor’, in the end, you gon’ understand exactly why they keep booking me
Now y’all look intrigued
Probably thinking to yourself, “Son, that’s wack!”
Well, that’s cool
Do me a favor
Look at your neighbor and tell ‘em, “You gon’ think it’s fire when I- (RUN THAT BACK!)
I said, ST. JOHN, RUTH-less
The EXODUS over there if you need to go, bro
You not TITUS me
You do NUMBERS, but once the MICAH ‘round my collar, forget promo!
Find JUDGES, when ISIAH bar, ACTS-ent and all, AMOS be cooking!  Geez!
MARK my words, CORINTHIAN
Y’all know exactly why they keep BOOKING me!
Now, look at D!  Lock horns!
They here for my pen, not yours!
My stock soared, and I came in a 10…like holiday popcorn!
But they want performance over bars these days!
Well, I got two gats!
One starts to do a random dance move, and the other shoots back
Then I get to walking all weird with the chopper
Are y’all confused yet?
HALF these dudes lie through they teeth…AND YOU COULD LITERALLY DO THAT!
Bro, you smell like you haven’t BATHED since Blackout 5!
You’re lying. I took a shower earlier
This is straight facts!
And I recognize that wardrobe
I GUARANTEE you haven’t washed that since the Pat Stay match!
Y’all stop me if what I’m saying ain’t true
THIS looks like the kid in class that ate glue!
All right, let’s change moods
‘Cause, vers’ Loso, you said some stuff that made me cringe
Exactly how you rap: “The five’ll lift up my pants without axing Bundy!
You’ll get dissed in the Six without axing Cudi!”
I can’t reiterate how much you have a lazy pen
So, this is the part where I start to show that you lack fervor
And everything from me is gold and original, like rap Werther’s
Ranks or charts, I’m past proving that I’m raw
So, now, I’m shooting up them all like mass murders
So, here’s a little tip, like bad service
I’m here to stay for a while like black churches
I’m making veteran moves: a fast learner
And I’m a problem to these veteran dudes like flag burners
This new wave ain’t the type to attract surfers
Everything we put out dope, like trap workers
So, I could give a flying…FORGIVENESS if you a gat-squirter
‘Cause I don’t believe a round ‘til I see it like Flat-Earthers!
Who needs a pocket check when you can tap further
Into the soul of a bum who Smack nurtured?
I ain’t playing games no more like crashed servers
And DNA getting dusted for prints like cat burglars!
Let’s call a spade a spade
Who you know that’s nice and new to the scene?
The answer better be Aaron
The wrong stare’ll put two to your spleen
I told ‘em, “They need a Plan B? We could do it in Queens!”
I’m top pen in your town
SPAYED, NEUTER, BARIN’, PLAN B
I ain’t finna be on YouTube time: we are not kidding around!
Look, I am 8-0 on the scene, and the key is even higher
I put the capo on the strings
And I ain’t stopping until the case closed
‘Til I Django the chain off whoever on that throne in the ring
Put ‘em six feet in the dirt, on a pay-per-view stream that’ll work
And have J. Lo and Drake hosting the thing!
I’m that nice!
And I ain’t come to get personal with you
But I brought enough bars to bury you and any person that’s with you!
So, go ahead and call up Shine
And tell him he can fall in line
And God is good (ALL THE TIME!)",King of the Dot,1996,[7],1
7,It's All Coming Back To Me Now,"[Verse 1]
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

[Outro]
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when you kiss me like this
(It's all coming back to me now)
And when I touch you like that
(It's all coming back to me now)
If you do it like this
(It's all coming back to me now)

With you boy",Sean Paul,1996,"[9, 10, 9, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16]",8
9,"I Finally Found Someone (From ""The Mirror Has Two Faces"")","WHAT is a judge-penitent? Ah, I intrigued you with that business. I meant no harm by it,
believe me, and I can explain myself more clearly. In a way, that even belongs to my official duties.
But first I must set forth a certain number of facts that will help you to understand my story.
A few years ago I was a lawyer in Paris and, indeed, a rather well-known lawyer. Of course, I
didn’t tell you my real name. I had a specialty: noble cases. Widows and orphans, as the saying
goes—I don’t know why, because there are improper widows and ferocious orphans. Yet it was
enough for me to sniff the slightest scent of victim on a defendant for me to swing into action. And
what action! A real tornado! My heart was on my sleeve. You would really have thought that justice
slept with me every night. I am sure you would have admired the rightness of my tone, the
appropriateness of my emotion, the persuasion and warmth, the restrained indignation of my
speeches before the court. Nature favored me as to my physique, [18] and the noble attitude comes
effortlessly. Furthermore, I was buoyed up by two sincere feelings: the satisfaction of being on the
right side of the bar and an instinctive scorn for judges in general. That scorn, after all, wasn’t
perhaps so instinctive. I know now that it had its reasons. But, seen from the outside, it looked
rather like a passion. It can’t be denied that, for the moment at least, we have to have judges, don’t
we? However, I could not understand how a man could offer himself to perform such a surprising
function. I accepted the fact because I saw it, but rather as I accepted locusts. With this difference:
that the invasions of those Orthoptera never brought me a son whereas I earned my living by
carrying on a dialogue with people I scorned.
But, after all, I was on the right side; that was enough to satisfy my conscience. The feeling of the
law, the satisfaction of being right, the joy of self-esteem, cher monsieur, are powerful incentives for
keeping us upright or keeping us moving forward. On the other hand, if you deprive men of them,
you transform them into dogs frothing with rage. How many crimes committed merely because [19]
their authors could not endure being wrong! I once knew a manufacturer who had a perfect wife,
admired by all, and yet he deceived her. That man was literally furious to be in the wrong, to be
blocked from receiving, or granting himself, a certificate of virtue. The more virtues his wife
manifested, the more vexed he became. Eventually, living in the wrong became unbearable to him.
What do you think he did then? He gave up deceiving her? Not at all. He killed her. That is how I
entered into relations with him.
My situation was more enviable. Not only did I run no risk of joining the criminal camp (in
particular I had no chance of killing my wife, being a bachelor), but I even took up their defense, on
the sole condition that they should be noble murderers, as others are noble savages. The very
manner in which I conducted that defense gave me great satisfactions. I was truly above reproach in
my professional life. I never accepted a bribe, it goes without saying, and I never stooped either to
any shady proceedings. And—this is even rarer—I never deigned to flatter any journalist to get him
on my side, nor any civil servant whose friendship [20] might be useful to me. I even had the luck of
seeing the Legion of Honor offered to me two or three times and of being able to refuse it with a
discreet dignity in which I found my true reward. Finally, I never charged the poor a fee and never
boasted of it. Don’t think for a moment, cher monsieur, that I am bragging. I take no credit for this.
The avidity which in our society substitutes for ambition has always made me laugh. I was aiming
higher; you will see that the expression is exact in my case.
But you can already imagine my satisfaction. I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all
know that there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to
condemn such joys as selfishness. At least I enjoyed that part of my nature which reacted so
appropriately to the widow and orphan that eventually, through exercise, it came to dominate my
whole life. For instance, I loved to help blind people cross streets. From as far away as I could see a cane hesitating on the edge of a sidewalk, I would rush forward, sometimes only a second ahead of
another charitable hand already outstretched, snatch the blind person from any solicitude but mine,
and lead [21] him gently but firmly along the crosswalk among the traffic obstacles toward the refuge
of the other sidewalk, where we would separate with a mutual emotion. In the same way, I always
enjoyed giving directions in the street, obliging with a light, lending a hand to heavy pushcarts,
pushing a stranded car, buying a paper from the Salvation Army lass or flowers from the old
peddler, though I knew she stole them from the Montparnasse cemetery. I also liked—and this is
harder to say—I liked to give alms. A very Christian friend of mine admitted that one’s initial feeling
on seeing a beggar approach one’s house is unpleasant. Well, with me it was worse: I used to exult.
But let’s not dwell on this.
Let us speak rather of my courtesy. It was famous and unquestionable. Indeed, good manners
provided me with great delights. If I had the luck, certain mornings, to give up my seat in the bus or
subway to someone who obviously deserved it, to pick up some object an old lady had dropped and
return it to her with a smile I knew well, or merely to forfeit my taxi to someone in a greater hurry
than I, it was a red-letter day. I even rejoiced, I must admit, those days when the transport system
[22] being on strike I had a chance to load into my car at the bus stops some of my unfortunate
fellow citizens unable to get home. Giving up my seat in the theater to allow a couple to sit together,
hoisting a girl’s suitcases onto the rack in a train—these were all deeds I performed more often than
others because I paid more attention to the opportunities and was better able to relish the pleasure
they give.
Consequently I was considered generous, and so I was. I gave a great deal in public and in
private. But far from suffering when I had to give up an object or a sum of money, I derived
constant pleasures from this—among them a sort of melancholy which occasionally rose within me
at the thought of the sterility of those gifts and the probable ingratitude that would follow. I even
took such pleasure in giving that I hated to be obliged to do so. Exactitude in money matters bored
me to death and I conformed ungraciously. I had to be the master of my liberalities.
These are just little touches but they will help you grasp the constant delights I experienced in my
life, and especially in my profession. Being stopped in the corridor of the law courts by the wife of a
[23] defendant you represented out of justice or pity alone—I mean without charge—hearing that
woman whisper that nothing, no, nothing could ever repay what you had done for them, replying
that it was quite natural, that anyone would have done as much, even offering some financial help to
tide over the bad days ahead, then—in order to cut the effusions short and preserve their proper
resonance—kissing the hand of a poor woman and breaking away—believe me, cher monsieur, this is
achieving more than the vulgar ambitious man and rising to that supreme summit where virtue is its
own reward
Let’s pause on these heights. Now you understand what I meant when I spoke of aiming higher. I
was talking, it so happens, of those supreme summits, the only places I can really live. Yes, I have
never felt comfortable except in lofty places. Even in the details of daily life, I needed to feel above. I
preferred the bus to the subway, open carriages to taxis, terraces to closed-in places. An enthusiast
for sport planes in which one’s head is in the open, on boats I was the eternal pacer of the top deck.
In the mountains I used to flee the deep valleys for [24] the passes and plateaus; I was the man of
the mesas at least. If fate had forced me to choose between work at a lathe or as a roofer, don’t
worry, I’d have chosen the roofs and become acquainted with dizziness. Coalbins, ships’ holds,
undergrounds, grottoes, pits were repulsive to me. I had even developed a special loathing for
speleologists, who had the nerve to fill the front page of our newspapers, and whose records
nauseated me. Striving to reach elevation minus eight hundred at the risk of getting one’s head
caught in a rocky funnel (a siphon, as those fools say!) seemed to me the exploit of perverted or
traumatized characters. There was something criminal underlying it.
A natural balcony fifteen hundred feet above a sea still visible bathed in sunlight, on the other
hand, was the place where I could breathe most freely, especially if I were alone, well above the
human ants. I could readily understand why sermons, decisive preachings, and fire miracles took
place on accessible heights. In my opinion no one meditated in cellars or prison cells (unless they
were situated in a tower with a broad view); one just became moldy. And I could understand that
man who, [25] having entered holy orders, gave up the frock because his cell, instead of overlooking
a vast landscape as he expected, looked out on a wall. Rest assured that as far as I was concerned I
did not grow moldy. At every hour of the day, within myself and among others, I would scale the
heights and light conspicuous fires, and a joyful greeting would rise toward me. Thus at least I took
pleasure in life and in my own excellence.
My profession satisfied most happily that vocation for summits. It cleansed me of all bitterness
toward my neighbor, whom I always obligated without ever owing him anything. It set me above the
judge whom I judged in turn, above the defendant whom I forced to gratitude. Just weigh this, cher
monsieur, I lived with impunity. I was concerned in no judgment; I was not on the floor of the
courtroom, but somewhere in the flies like those gods that are brought down by machinery from
time to time to transfigure the action and give it its meaning. After all, living aloft is still the only way
of being seen and hailed by the largest number.
Besides, some of my good criminals had killed [26] in obedience to the same feeling. Reading the
newspapers afterward, in the sorry condition in which they then were, doubtless brought them a sort
of unhappy compensation. Like many men, they had no longer been able to endure anonymity, and
that impatience had contributed to leading them to unfortunate extremities. To achieve notoriety it
is enough, after all, to kill one’s concierge. Unhappily, this is usually an ephemeral reputation, so
many concierges are there who deserve and receive the knife. Crime constantly monopolizes the
headlines, but the criminal appears there only fugitively, to be replaced at once. In short, such brief
triumphs cost too dear. Defending our unfortunate aspirants after a reputation amounted, on the
other hand, to becoming really well known, at the same time and in the same places, but by more
economical means. Consequently this encouraged me to making more meritorious efforts so that
they would pay as little as possible. What they were paying they were doing so to some extent in my
place. The indignation, talent, and emotion I expended on them washed away, in return, any debt I
might feel toward them. The judges punished and the defendants expiated, [27] while I, free of any
duty, shielded from judgment as from penalty, I freely held sway bathed in a light as of Eden.
Indeed, wasn’t that Eden, cher monsieur: no intermediary between life and me? Such was my life. I
never had to learn how to live. In that regard, I already knew everything at birth. Some people’s
problem is to protect themselves from men or at least to come to terms with them. In my case, the
understanding was already established. Familiar when it was appropriate, silent when necessary,
capable of a free and easy manner as readily as of dignity, I was always in harmony. Hence my
popularity was great and my successes in society innumerable. I was acceptable in appearance; I
revealed myself to be both a tireless dancer and an unobtrusively learned man; I managed to love
simultaneously—and this is not easy—women and justice; I indulged in sports and the fine arts—in
short, I’ll not go on for fear you might suspect me of self-flattery. But just imagine, I beg you, a man
at the height of his powers, in perfect health, generously gifted, skilled in bodily exercises as in those
of the mind, neither rich nor poor, sleeping well, [28] and fundamentally pleased with himself
without showing this otherwise than by a felicitous sociability. You will readily see how I can speak,
without immodesty, of a successful life.
Yes, few creatures were more natural than I. I was altogether in harmony with life, fitting into it
from top to bottom without rejecting any of its ironies, its grandeur, or its servitude. In particular
the flesh, matter, the physical in short, which disconcerts or discourages so many men in love or in
solitude, without enslaving me, brought me steady joys. I was made to have a body. Whence that harmony in me, that relaxed mastery that people felt, even to telling me sometimes that it helped
them in life. Hence my company was in demand. Often, for instance, people thought they had met
me before. Life, its creatures and its gifts, offered themselves to me, and I accepted such marks of
homage with a kindly pride. To tell the truth, just from being so fully and simply a man, I looked
upon myself as something of a superman.
I was of respectable but humble birth (my father was an officer), and yet, certain mornings, let
me confess it humbly, I felt like a king’s son, or a [29] burning bush. It was not a matter, mind you,
of the certainty I had of being more intelligent than everyone else. Besides, such certainty is of no
consequence because so many imbeciles share it. No, as a result of being showered with blessings, I
felt, I hesitate to admit, marked out. Personally marked out, among all, for that long and
uninterrupted success. This, after all, was a result of my modesty. I refused to attribute that success
to my own merits and could not believe that the conjunction in a single person of such different and
such extreme virtues was the result of chance alone. This is why in my happy life I felt somehow
that that happiness was authorized by some higher decree. When I add that I had no religion you
can see even better how extraordinary that conviction was. Whether ordinary or not, it served for
some time to raise me above the daily routine and I literally soared for a period of years, for which,
to tell the truth, I still long in my heart of hearts. I soared until the evening when ... But no, that’s
another matter and it must be forgotten. Anyway, I am perhaps exaggerating. I was at ease in
everything, to be sure, but at the same time satisfied with nothing. [30] Each joy made me desire
another. I went from festivity to festivity. On occasion I danced for nights on end, ever madder
about people and life. At times, late on those nights when the dancing, the slight intoxication, my
wild enthusiasm, everyone’s violent unrestraint would fill me with a tired and overwhelmed rapture,
it would seem to me—at the breaking point of fatigue and for a second’s flash—that at last I
understood the secret of creatures and of the world. But my fatigue would disappear the next day,
and with it the secret; I would rush forth anew. I ran on like that, always heaped with favors, never
satiated, without knowing where to stop, until the day—until the evening rather when the music
stopped and the lights went out. The gay party at which I had been so happy ... But allow me to call
on our friend the primate. Nod your head to thank him and, above all, drink up with me, I need
your understanding.
I see that that declaration amazes you. Have you never suddenly needed understanding, help,
friendship? Yes, of course. I have learned to be satisfied with understanding. It is found more readily
and, besides, it’s not binding. “I beg you to believe [31] in my sympathetic understanding” in the
inner discourse always precedes immediately “and now, let’s turn to other matters.” It’s a board
chairman’s emotion; it comes cheap, after catastrophes. Friendship is less simple. It is long and hard
to obtain, but when one has it there’s no getting rid of it; one simply has to cope with it. Don’t think
for a minute that your friends will telephone you every evening, as they ought to, in order to find out
if this doesn’t happen to be the evening when you are deciding to commit suicide, or simply whether
you don’t need company, whether you are not in a mood to go out. No, don’t worry, they’ll ring up
the evening you are not alone, when life is beautiful. As for suicide, they would be more likely to
push you to it, by virtue of what you owe to yourself, according to them. May heaven protect us, cher
monsieur, from being set on a pedestal by our friends! Those whose duty is to love us—I mean
relatives and connections (what an expression!)—are another matter. They find the right word, all
right, and it hits the bull’s-eye; they telephone as if shooting a rifle. And they know how to aim. Oh,
the Bazaines!
[32] What? What evening? I’ll get to it, be patient with me. In a certain way I am sticking to my
subject with all that about friends and connections. You see, I’ve heard of a man whose friend had
been imprisoned and who slept on the floor of his room every night in order not to enjoy a comfort
of which his friend had been deprived. Who, cher monsieur, will sleep on the floor for us? Whether I am capable of it myself? Look, I’d like to be and I shall be. Yes, we shall all be capable of it one day,
and that will be salvation. But it’s not easy, for friendship is absent-minded or at least unavailing. It
is incapable of achieving what it wants. Maybe, after all, it doesn’t want it enough? Maybe we don’t
love life enough? Have you noticed that death alone awakens our feelings? How we love the friends
who have just left us? How we admire those of our teachers who have ceased to speak, their mouths
filled with earth! Then the expression of admiration springs forth naturally, that admiration they
were perhaps expecting from us all their lives. But do you know why we are always more just and
more generous toward the dead? The reason is simple. With them there is no obligation. [33] They
leave us free and we can take our time, fit the testimonial in between a cocktail party and a nice little
mistress, in our spare time, in short. If they forced us to anything, it would be to remembering, and
we have a short memory. No, it is the recently dead we love among our friends, the painful dead,
our emotion, ourselves after all!
For instance, I had a friend I generally avoided. He rather bored me, and, besides, he was
something of a moralist. But when he was on his death bed, I was there—don’t worry. I never
missed a day. He died satisfied with me, holding both my hands. A woman who used to chase after
me, and in vain, had the good sense to die young. What room in my heart at once! And when, in
addition, it’s a suicide! Lord, what a delightful commotion! One’s telephone rings, one’s heart
overflows, and the intentionally short sentences yet heavy with implications, one’s restrained
suffering and even, yes, a bit of self-accusation!
That’s the way man is, cher monsieur. He has two faces: he can’t love without self-love. Notice your
neighbors if perchance a death takes place in the building. They were asleep in their little [34] routine
and suddenly, for example, the concierge dies. At once they awake, bestir themselves, get the details,
commiserate. A newly dead man and the show begins at last. They need tragedy, don’t you know; it’s
their little transcendence, their apéritif. Moreover, is it mere chance that I should speak of a
concierge? I had one, really ill favored, malice incarnate, a monster of insignificance and rancor, who
would have discouraged a Franciscan. I had even given up speaking to him, but by his mere
existence he compromised my customary contentedness. He died and I went to his funeral. Can you
tell me why?
Anyway, the two days preceding the ceremony were full of interest. The concierge’s wife was ill,
lying in the single room, and near her the coffin had been set on sawhorses. Everyone had to get his
mail himself. You opened the door, said “Bonjour, madame,” listened to her praise of the dear
departed as she pointed to him, and took your mail. Nothing very amusing about that. And yet the
whole building passed through her room, which stank of carbolic acid. And the tenants didn’t send
their servants either; they came themselves to take [35] advantage of the unexpected attraction. The
servants did too, of course, but on the sly. The day of the funeral, the coffin was too big for the
door. “Oh my dearie,” the wife said from her bed with a surprise at once delighted and grieved,
“how big he was!” “Don’t worry, madame,” replied the funeral director, “we’ll get him through
edgewise, and upright.” He was got through upright and then laid down again, and I was the only
one (with a former cabaret doorman who, I gathered, used to drink his Pernod every evening with
the doparted) to go as far as the cemetery and strew flowers on a coffin of astounding luxury. Then I
paid a visit to the concierge’s wife to receive her thanks expressed as by a great tragedienne. Tell me,
what was the reason for all that? None, except the apértif.
I likewise buried an old fellow member of the Lawyers’ Guild. A clerk to whom no one paid
attention, but I always shook his hand. Where I worked I used to shake everyone’s hand, moreover,
being doubly sure to miss no one. Without much effort, such cordial simplicity won me the
popularity so necessary to my contentment. For the [36] funeral of our clerk the President of the
Guild had not gone out of his way. But I did, and on the eve of a trip, as was amply pointed out. It so happened that I knew my presence would be noticed and favorably commented on. Hence, you
see, not even the snow that was falling that day made me withdraw.
What? I’m getting to it, never fear; besides, I have never left it. But let me first point out that my
concierge’s wife, who had gone to such an out lay for the crucifix, heavy oak, and silver handles in
order to get the most out of her emotion, had shacked up a month later with an overdressed yokel
proud of his singing voice. He used to beat her; frightful screams could be heard and immediately
afterward he would open the window and give forth with his favorite song: “Women, how pretty
you are!” “All the same!” the neighbors would say. All the same what? I ask you. All right,
appearances were against the baritone, and against the concierge’s wife, too. But nothing proves that
they were not in love. And nothing proves either that she did not love her husband. Moreover, when
the yokel took flight, his voice and arm exhausted, she [37]—that faithful wife—resumed her praises
of the departed. After all, I know of others who have appearances on their side and are no more
faithful or sincere. I knew a man who gave twenty years of his life to a scatterbrained woman,
sacrificing everything to her, his friendships, his work, the very respectability of his life, and who one
evening recognized that he had never loved her. He had been bored, that’s all, bored like most
people. Hence he had made himself out of whole cloth a life full of complications and drama.
Something must happen—and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen,
even loveless slavery, even war or death. Hurray then for funerals!
But I at least didn’t have that excuse. I was not bored because I was riding on the crest of the
wave. On the evening I am speaking about I can say that I was even less bored than ever. And yet ...
You see, cher monsieur, it was a fine autumn evening, still warm in town and already damp over the
Seine. Night was falling; the sky, still bright in the west, was darkening; the street lamps were
glowing dimly. I was walking up the quays of the Left Bank toward the Pont des Arts. The river was
gleaming [38] between the stalls of the secondhand booksellers. There were but few people on the
quays; Paris was already at dinner. I was treading on the dusty yellow leaves that still recalled
summer. Gradually the sky was filling with stars that could be seen for a moment after leaving one
street lamp and heading toward another. I enjoyed the return of silence, the evening’s mildness, the
emptiness of Paris. I was happy. The day had been good: a blind man, the reduced sentence I had
hoped for, a cordial handclasp from my client, a few liberalities, and in the afternoon, a brilliant
improvisation in the company of several friends on the hardheartedness of our governing class and
the hypocrisy of our leaders.
I had gone up on the Pont des Arts, deserted at that hour, to look at the river that could hardly
be made out now night had come. Facing the statue of the Vert-Galant, I dominated the island. I felt
rising within me a vast feeling of power and—I don’t know how to express it—of completion,
which cheered my heart. I straightened up and was about to light a cigarette, the cigarette of
satisfaction, when, at that very moment, a laugh burst out [39] behind me. Taken by surprise, I
suddenly wheeled around; there was no one there. I stepped to the railing; no barge or boat. I turned
back toward the island and, again, heard the laughter behind me, a little farther off as if it were going
downstream. I stood there motionless. The sound of the laughter was decreasing, but I could still
hear it distinctly behind me, come from nowhere unless from the water. At the same time I was
aware of the rapid beating of my heart. Please don’t misunderstand me; there was nothing
mysterious about that laugh; it was a good, hearty, almost friendly laugh, which re-established the
proper proportions. Soon I heard nothing more, anyway. I returned to the quays, went up the rue
Dauphine, bought some cigarettes I didn’t need at all. I was dazed and had trouble breathing. That
evening I rang up a friend, who wasn’t at home. I was hesitating about going out when, suddenly, I
heard laughter under my windows. I opened them. On the sidewalk, in fact, some youths were
loudly saying good night. I shrugged my shoulders as I closed the windows; after all, I had a brief to study. I went into the bathroom to drink a glass of water. My reflection was smiling in the
mirror, but it seemed to me that my smile was double ...
What? Forgive me, I was thinking of something else. I’ll see you again tomorrow, probably.
Tomorrow, yes, that’s right. No, no, I can’t stay. Besides, I am called in consultation by that brown
bear of a man you see over there. A decent fellow, for sure, whom the police are meanly persecuting
out of sheer perversity. You think he looks like a killer? Rest assured that his actions conform to his
looks. He burgles likewise, and you will be surprised to learn that that cave man is specialized in the
art trade. In Holland everyone is a specialist in paintings and in tulips. This one, with his modest
mien, is the author of the most famous theft of a painting. Which one? I may tell you. Don’t be
surprised at my knowledge. Although I am a judge-penitent, I have my side line here: I am the legal
counselor of these good people. I studied the laws of the country and built up a clientele in this
quarter where diplomas are not required. It wasn’t easy, but I inspire confidence, don’t I? I have a
good, hearty laugh and an energetic handshake, and those are trump cards. Besides, I settled a
few difficult cases, out of self-interest to begin with and later out of conviction. If pimps and thieves
were invariably sentenced, all decent people would get to thinking they themselves were constantly
innocent, cher monsieur. And in my opinion—all right, all right, I’m coming!—that’s what must be
avoided above all. Otherwise, everything would be just a joke.",Albert Camus,1996,"[10, 8, 8, 8, 11, 28]",6

So hit the deck quick
I like to kick shit that makes you wonder how
A devilish child

Something you never saw is now seen
With my X-ray vision I can see everything
It's like life on the big screen I'm viewing
Looking in from the outside is what I'm doing
Coming to you like a poetic Socrates
With the scientific method I'm dropping my hypotheses
I predict and pick the roads I walk on
Select and wreck every rhythm I talk on
So here's the flow that I dreamed last night
I was rapping to The Sandman
Cause even in my sleep I write
Nightmarish poetry
I'll say Mastamind's in the house
So you know it's me
I want to hit your mental telepathy with this rhyme
So I kick it one time for your mind

This is definitely one to grow on
Your mind, body and soul grows as I flow on
Only if Einstein would have wrote rhymes
His name would have been The Unbeatable Mastamind

What would life be without a Reel Life creation?
Come and take a dose of this poisonous medicine
And once it sets in your fucking head spins
Ain't nothing wrong with addiction

I'm in the mood to raise and build
If the place ain't filled
It's cause all my people are getting killed

I keep my eyes on the prize

When he dies
I guess he's sent to Hell where he fries
Too bad I can't be headed for the skies
Time is up
It's too late
I already know my fate
I can't wait
'Til Judgment Day comes
When I can rock it in Hell over some Wicket bass drums

I mean, the shit be right there
He just gotta go get it
Niggas wanna live like the movie Above the Rim, then get goaltended
Everybody wanna be Birdie, then see fo’ pigeons!
Y’all see where I’m ‘bout to go wit’ it
If I was Motaw, he’s Shep, and this the end of that fourth quarter
Remember when he got the gun from the back?
A nigga like woulda been had it on him
Grabbed the four, and...passed the ball, and...wait ‘til he get back on offense
Then he get clapped off the court like Magic Johnson!
You see them Mexican bars took you far, but I doubt it could get farther
They knew it was gon’ be a fight...they just came to see who hit harder
But watch what you say, nigga!
You’ll get your shit clobbered, my fist palm him
I’ll beat the sweet out this nigga for letting his pen yard us (pinata)!
It’s two types of Mexicans in life, I’mma explain both things
You got the ones that get a lotta cocaine ‘cross the border…
And the ones that look like they bought a whole lotta cocaine
I mean, shit, everybody hit the block befo’
That don’t mean you made profit, though
It all could fall in one push...any nigga that sold a dime’ll know (domino)
But you paid for battles and got no-showed
If a nigga ever tried-
Deadass! I was there!
You paid for battles and got no-showed
If a nigga ever tried to zo’ me out some bread, he wouldn’t get to hear the end of it
That just show when he gets zo’d, he act (Zodiac) half a man: Sagittarius!
Man, when I look at you, I don’t see Don-
Man, dead body

[Round 2: Don Marino]
I heard you signed a URL contract
How the fuck you sign a URL contract, and get Don for some kicks?
Nobody ain’t told me shit
Yo, Norbes, me and son got it switched!
You really signin’ that? You’ll put ink on that bitch?
And if you got one, where the fuck my-
Nah, I’m Mexican: I never needed paperwork to sneak off with some shit!
I’ll have your bitch on all fours, she feelin’ this vato
She’s somethin’ I’m poppin’ on
I’ll stuff my jalapeno in her box like Papa John’s!
You said that? You said that?
So you know what this about
You can taste the nina
BAH! I took the words right outta yo’ mouth!
See, I might as well use your bars, so you could take this hearse ride
Against Rah and Short Fuse, you recycled material, committed the worst crime
I mean, if it didn’t light the room, or create that boom, then why reverse rhymes?
If it had no spark with Short Fuse, then why reuse, Gunpowder, if it didn’t blow up the first time!?
I don’t respect your grind!
Y’all think he’s the best bet!?
This your third PG, and Norbes gave you me, ‘cause he know I’m the next threat
You at WeGoHard saw what I did to Chess when that vet slept?
My abilities, Paranormal Activity
Now I gotta lay Powder down for y’all to see my next step!
So you put your trust in this cat, ‘til them shells blow
Chapelle’s Show: I walk outta nowhere, and drop a buck in his cap!
Spray his people
Think Ray Finkle, ‘cause if y’all get him to snap
Y’all gonna get mad at Marino when I fuck up the Patt (P.A.T.)
Don’t talk about the trap, like I wasn’t dodging the policia
Hand directly on the burner: I was flippin’ tortillas!
They raided my cousin’s crib, I felt bad for my poor tia
I had more Mexican grams at that table than loteria!
I get the fif’ in Powder like Chapo, fam’
I lean back with two arms: this my vato stance!
You think I cut grass or own a taco stand!?
Man, off the corner, I was savage with the elbow
Oooh yeah, like Macho Man!
Come on, fam’
If we was caught in a hard place
Before we’d pass “Go”, my holmes (homes) put down, and blew (blue) corners like Park Place
I had the chopper pointed down the whip: it’s a car chase
I hit the Powder before I go out shooting like Scarface
‘Cause here’s the taste
It’s plain (plane) to see we air hearts (Earhart), no Amelia
And I don’t use Uber Pool ‘cause they never have enough seats for the familia!
‘Til my vato pulls up-

[So Severe]
Ayo, Don, lemme get-

[Don Marino]
Nah, chill, chill, chill
Lemme slash his neck first

[So Severe]
All right, but lemme get-

[Don Marino]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!
With the blade, I’ll slice him up and stick him in a piano for the perks

[So Severe]
Well, then, I’ll just-

[Don Marino]
No, no, no, ‘cause I’mma bury him behind the church
And use his skull to dig up the plot and dirt!

[So Severe]
Well, then what’chu want me to do!?

[Don Marino]
Nothing! The Mexicans used to doing all the work!
YOU LUCKY I FUCKED UP!
YOU LUCKY I FUCKED UP!

[Round 3: Gunpowder Patt]
He think ‘cause I’m Black and he Mexican, we deal with the same type of race ish
Nigga, everybody love Raymond...everybody hate Chris!
African bars!
African bars, I can’t relate to this Mexican
You got a trunk on your car? It’s a trunk on my elephant!
BIG gun, gotta hold it like a speakerbox
Heaters cocked
Three pounds and a fif’ to ya do’, like a secret knock!
Y’all know what he look like?
You look like you not allowed within 100 feet of no school
Gotta watch how I approach you
Look like you got bullied in class all ya life…
Nigga, you was home-schooled!
And y’all really got me tryna rap with this dummy?
Nigga look like he went to the barbershop and asked for a noogie
The barber said, “Yeah, c’mere!”, gave the nigga a noogie
Don looked in the mirror...and paid the nigga money!
You in a fight with the wrong weapon
You look like you beyond stressin’
Like, like…
You work at Bed, Bath & Beyond, in the “Beyond” section!
Hold on…
You battled Chess, and think you buzzin’ now…
Beat Prez, then you somethin’ now…
He think he got a leg up on me…
Saw 6: cut it out!
What happened now?
You don’t know about me? Ask around
Silencer look like the wood tip on a Black & Mild
Thang smokin’, brains open
I’mma take two out ya pack: nigga, I’m chain-smokin’
Toss you and the murder weapon in the same ocean
He gon’ try to save his boy and see (buoyancy) he ain’t floatin’!
When I look at you, I don’t see Don Marino-
Nigga, I ain’t done yet!
I’ll be in yo’ crib wit’ yo’ bitch, while you not in there
Wearin’ yo’ house shoes, scorin’ 3-points on yo’ MyCareer!
No lie, this shit be fucked up in the streets
Wanna know why? (Why?)
‘Cause my OG younger than me
This nigga be tellin’ me what the fuck to do…
After I drop him off to fuckin’ school
Time
Let’s go, Mexico

[Round 3: Don Marino]
Honestly, I feel disrespected
You went from Staxx Rilla to Gunpowder Patt, tryna get detected
I went from Don Dollaz to Don Marino, we both got rejected
Now we both got accepted
It’s inspiration
It’s like immigration: we both had to change our names to cross over to get accepted!
But check it
Ever since Cortez, there hasn’t been a Spanish battler on the scene
I gotta ask about
I mean, I’m the first Miami battler to get a PG
But I’m always gonna back this out
The irony: Chino plugged me in with Powder so I could produce for SMACK
See how the trappers out?
No wonder they booked a Mexican
We good with numbers, but we known to pack the house!
So watch your mouth!
I came a long way from the tomato fields to the lime trees!
Now it’s bars, performance, them lines mean
So you right, it’s that pen shit, wreck shit with the rhyme schemes
It is forensics, ‘cause if I go ballistic and dust Gunpowder, it’s ‘bout to be a crime scene!
So just know I’m with the drama!
Napoleon Dynamite: I was out back, feeding the Llama!
It was a must, so trust
We was holding up signs, waiting for the ratchet to get off the bus
So don’t fuss!
I hold the pound for the clowns
You battled Skates, right?
My brother, you had to use that to get around!
I hold it down for my amigos, it’s lethal
My uncle got caught throwing bullets on cam’: he got hit with the Rico!
So mira, mijo, they say I’m next up
Well, that’s what they say, so I need the pesos
They tryna push a chico in front of the class: Vote For Pedro!
Mexican bars!
Trump finna get his sooner or later!
But until then, we keep looking over that fence like nosy neighbors
I heard you had to push that mary with the ratchet and get some papers
Ironic: I had to push to get married with the ratchet and get some papers!
Mexican bars!
They keep throwing dirt on my name, but I dug out the hope
Saw I.C.E. run in, get slugs from the chrome
That shit hurt my heart when I seen ‘em get drug from their homes
Now they’re back in Mexico, they’re smugglers
You wouldn’t believe what they drug out of holmes!
Mexican bars!
See, if they raid your crib, they’ll probably find everything illegal in the home
If they raid my crib, they’ll find everyone illegal in the home!
They send us back, it’s a danger zone
Grip the chrome
You might think I have a light point
But trust me, E.T. was the only alien that wanted to go home!
Mexican bars!
They had me losing to Chess, Prez, even you, and I hate the odds
I put on for my city, now I paid the squad
And we do got other work: landscaping, painting, construction
But you better pray to God
‘Cause if they let this Mexican into battle rap-

Of light mists with pale amber rose
Feels like I'm lost in a deep cloud of heavenly scent
Touching, discovering you

17,What Kind Of Man Would I Be,"[Intro]
You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen

[Verse 1]
You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you remained and
To hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
The yearning inside

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Verse 2]
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
This is no lie
Still, here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

Here we are all alone
But somehow we've got to stay strong

If I lived unfaithfully

It won't justify throwing love aside

I didn't know you'd be insane

The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you is a

Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?
Sorry, I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry, Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler, well then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Uh, feel like I've been asleep and alone
And lovin' this angel, entangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll
Where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just wanna free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry

22,"Tell Me (From ""Eddie"")","[Verse One]
In the December of '81, way before rhyme was relevant
A child was born during a winter storm to Evelyn
My pops was Eddie, I don't really think he was ready
The nigga left me damn near as I came out the belly
From what they tell me from day one, I have always been heavy
Now weight wise, they say I have been here already
I'm starting to believe 'em
Sparking my weed and I'm coughing and wheezing
I talk with demons
Ghost and gremlins, swear to God I see 'em
In the back of my mind, I travel back and through time
When I was nine and I would practice this rhyme
But my step pops said ""Stop, or get your head popped.""
If I did not I swear ock, he put me in headlocks
My feet dangling, just kicking his thighs
He's 6'2"", I'm 3'5, eye to eye we knee high
See I, got pain bottled up so deep
And so much stress it's like my first CD on repeat
Number nine when I rhyme and these herbs see me
Up on stage with all this rage, they like, ""Hey look at Reef.""
Then I'm okay but when I lay at the end of the day
I'm dealing with grown man issues and I'm still underage
Under paid and overworked, I feel like I'm worthless
I kept these facts under wraps and now I pull back the curtains
To my situation, reverses these verses shall serve the purpose
Of cleansing my soul until it's dirtless!
Yo

You don't know what it's like to be me
This is my life
And y'all swear I got it so easy
This is my life
But you don't know the half believe me
The pain in my heart exceeds me, ask my nigga Sleep E
This is my life
So much stress, ain't nothing changed dawg
This is my life
So I get high until my brain's gone
This is my life
Until the pains gone, the same song then plays on in my head
Making my days long
This is my life

[Verse Two]
I stare at these questions
My rhymes are my homework
Comparing these lessons
Preparing for my weekly therapy sessions
Aggression and anger
Combined with a weak mind, that's danger
The eyes of a painter trying to paint the eyes of a stranger
That's why it's hard for me to open my heart
When those that I let in just stepped in and broke in my heart
Not just women but those that claim to be my niggas
Pseudo fake father figure dudes, I figured you
Would try to reach me
Eventually you'll try and leave me
But why did you leave me?
The only question to you I pose
I'm okay but I'm still alive, trying to survive
In this holocaust maze, spend my days in a daze
Wanting to fly away
It's hard to stay focused
When these jokers in your face just to get paid
But yet my pockets is still flat
My knowledge is still intact but as years go by dawg I feel that
I'll never make it
Record exec's like ""You're not good enough kid, face it.""
The next stop, hip hop sanctum
My mother's basement
Remembering the good ole' days, I can't take it
The possibility I never sign a deal
It didn't matter now that I'm getting older
It's getting colder I need a shield
A career, year two
I have to be known as the greatest rapper
Since the other two or massacred
At least they were famous
I'm popular to you but everywhere else I'm nameless
I guess that's how the game is
The older I get, the younger I wish I still was
No longer deal drugs
But still get high to feel love
I'm real buzzed for a minute then it
Begins to escape me
These demons I push behind are forcing themselves to face me
Maybe I'm crazy
No I think I'm too sane for my own good
I know I zone hoods to find what makes me
Spit like this
And tick like that
And I flip like that
And if I fall I get right back
On the right track until I'm dead gone
But the only tracks are follow are the ones in my headphones
Yo

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
This 9 to 5 grind got my mind losing it's juices
Come inside and you'll find
That even though I'm popular and I know how to rhyme
Everything ain't what it seems, I just know how to lie
To my peers for years but I can no longer hide
To that man in the mirror and when I look in his eyes
I see a child who has no idea of what he's doing
Sometimes I wonder if this music will only lead to my ruin
What I'm pursing is to get rich
Doing rap songs
Old heads saying, ""You ain't that strong
You need something to fall back on.""
Here's the dilemma
Losing life or become a winner
End up a working class stiff or flip back to sinner
Either way I feel the saga will never conclude
You need to know my views before you step in my shoes
My life's become a full scale trauma of mass confusion
I have yet to scratch the surface, already I'm disillusioned
So either you part of the problem or offer a solution
Cause I people I used to love are now considered nuisances
It's been proven
You dudes got no love for me
You place me on a pedestal and pull the rug from under me
It's kind of sick these cowards will build my confidence
Only to hide their dominant prescience of their incompetence
It's not that I'm being selfish, I'm not trying to share the wealth
But please don't act like you ain't in my life for yourself
I'm a rhyme stand out
Niggas hands out
They wanna kick it
Ride my back like [?] Amtrak and I'm they ticket
Check your bags at the door along with your ego
Cause it wasn't till The High Life that I talk to you people
Now I walk with you people
All of a sudden niggas acting like cousins and brothers
Motherfucker you play a part of nothing
Waiting for the moment for my career to start jumping
So you can be right there when the cheese begins to cutting
Here's a percentage
Get the fuck away from me I'm finished
The jig is up
Give it up, just stop pretending
What a tangled web we weave
Got me trapped in the nonsense
But I will no longer ignore my conscious",Reef the Lost Cauze,1996,"[24, 23, 20, 22, 22, 22, 18, 22, 23, 29, 29, 37, 41, 49, 49, 52, 69, 91]",18

If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart
So you could see the truth

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

[Chorus]
And I can change the world
I will be the sunlight in your universe
You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

[Verse 2]
If I could be king
Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way

And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

25,Street Dreams,"[Produced by Tracksmasters]

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
But now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

[Chorus]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Bimmers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something

And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her

Mobbin'
You claiming HOG wearing MOB gear
These are more than fashion logos
When you see us know what we're representing
And that's the Logos
Forever mobbin homie we are not a pack of bozos
Can't have a circle looking weird out here
That's the noble
Can't be slacking doing kingdom business
That's immobile
Remember that man will on talent
God say that's a no no
When it comes to the gospel the impact is global
Bring the heat got up to city
Like what happened at Chernobyl
Bring to the Father to put Christ holy order
Upon me
Was a zombie
Want the living water not talking Dasani
Gimme a sword and I say it's on
When it come to this army
We going to war but never fold
I'm not origami
We've been given the message to take to the masses
So I spend my days in deep meditation and practice
Seeking repentance it cleared me from my horrible actions
So I'm not a hypocrite as I travel over the atlas

[Verse 2: Justus]
It's the mob nigga
It's more than music it is ministry
Started by Sevin if he's Paul I am Timothy
We take the gospel where them Lugers and them hitters be
We're supplying this industry
You dying if you fidgety
They get to riding
If you sliding with the menace beings
We ain't hiding anything
He's bright and what we fitna bring
He's light
So if anything think twice
Before you get the swing
You might even get to me
But desire ain't gone be hid from me
My blood brother was a blood
Brotha when I was cuz
That's what the neighborhood does
They be stay bathing in blood
Babies raped in mud
Scabies sage and drugs
But greater is His love greater is His love
And He will return to judge and begin again
God man spit fire from the skull just like finish him
In the end when they see what we did
At a minimum we delivered him
And we live in him
I guess you call that synonym

[Chorus: Justus]
I gotta be honest
You really don't want these problems
Now
We suffer in violence
The enemy still try to knock us now
We more than conquerors
There's no way to conquer us

We ain't losin'
We stay rockin'

Life as a razorback
Used to hate to rap
Now lay a track and watch a gator snap
The hood I play Barack
Pray for that

Throw a white flag

Gorilla with chinchilla demons
Are taking that
Sin killa in a tent
Well I don't know where brakes is at
He has feet ten milla
Christ name whole way

I see ya boots but where your laces at
I bring the Son to where the shade is at

The ruger chew through your civic

You're new to the scrimmage

Yeah Ghetto gospel
Bringing His love into where the thugs hang
They drug slang and it's nothing to hear a snub bang
I'm from the park homie
Better yank me out the blood gang
And left his mark on me when He saved me
That's a blood stain
On my momma I knew it since elementary
The way I'm getting down
I'll get threw in a cell eventually
A demon's spawn I was foolish
Thought hell was meant for me
But now I'm reading Psalms
When I suit up with hella infantry
Ahh
I seen a rope of sin
Strangle a heathen
But we invokers bringing hope to men
And manglin' demons
Baptize em
We splash whoever came to receive Him
Christ gang put up ya cash
Who wanna tangle this evenin'?
If you blastin the master you get chastised
We leave a serpent slain
Wet em with purple rain under black sky
I'm from the dark
Where life is harder than some crack pipes
I'm really out here nigga
I don't rap lies
No perpetrating the mission
I go berserk over the church or for the sake of the risen
They can insert me in the dirt
Or through the gate of a prison
I'd take a squirter to the face
Before I hesitate to say I'm a Christian
Yeshua
Came as a servant and He died for the lost
Paid our debt with His blood
He supplied what it cost
Showed us the Father
We'd rather follow idols that floss
Bottom line we are in sin commercializing His cross
If the game's bearing His name
Yet full of fame tricks and heretics
And it wears it in vain then we are supposed to judge it
As far as CHH I hate the culture of it
It doesn't look like Christ I'm not supposed to love it
Rough as raw hide
Nothing but the cross inside a hog's eye
Fadin' with satan
I let my paws fly
Touch not thy anointed boy
I am God's guy
Ice'll burn
Christ'll return before the MOB dies

You really don't want these problems

We suffer in violence
The enemy still try to knock us now
We more than conquerors
There's no way to conquer us

We ain't losin'
We stay rockin'

You're my love, you're my sweetest thing
Don't shy away, don't shy away
Every night makes me hate the days
Can't get enough of your love

Am I wrong? Am I so unkind
Show me the way

Feeling good let's go all the way
It's got to be set me free
But tonight let my body say
Take it slow, don't let it go

How can I prove my love to you
Baby please, you're all I need
Like a child but it's born out of phase
Could act the angel but it wouldn't be true

33,Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First),"[Verse 1]
In a hand painted night, me and Gypsy Scotty are partners
At the Hotel Flamingo, wearin' black market shoes
This loud Cuban band is crucifying John Lennon
No one wants to be lonely, no one wants to sing the blues

[Verse 2]
She's perched like a parrot on his tuxedo shoulder
Christ, what's she doing with him, she could be dancing with me
She stirs the ice in her glass with her elegant finger
I want to be what she's drinking, yeah, I just want to be

[Chorus]
I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
I saw you first, don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin' but I saw you first

[Verse 3]
On a moon-spattered road in her parrot rebozo
Gypsy Scotty is driving his big long yellow car
She flies like a bird over his shoulder
She whispers in his ear, boy, you are my star

[Chorus]
But I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first, don't that give me the right
To move around in your heart
Everyone was lookin'

[Verse 4]
In the bone-colored dawn, me and Gypsy Scotty are singin'
The radio is playin', she left her shoes out in the back
He tells me a story about some girl he knows in Kentucky
He just made that story up, there ain't no girl like that

[Chorus]
But I saw you first, I'm the first one tonight
Yes, I saw you first, don't that give me the right

You know how I do
And you know how I flow
Can I get your name and number

And I dig the way you move
And the way you do your thing
Baby you can bring it on
You can swing it this way

Boy it's something about you

35,You Learn/You Oughta Know,"[Intro]
If ignorance is bliss then I'm fucking suffering
Bring on the heat bitch I love the game
This plane is plain wrong hold on to the string
No need to preach I've reached the pinnacle
Ok cool come follow me
Leave your suitcase it'll just get in the way
Everything's the way that it oughta be, we'll that's the theory
A little vex, with mix of cynical

[Verse 1]
Bass booming ruin the mood of neighbors a lot
Knocking on my door but I ignore 'em enormous amounts
Of that loud, quiet down we ain't running out
No time soon, consume the fumes of the fowl
Fool, the young mind is so malleable
Moldable, roll it into a blunt to be blunt with you
Priorities, to tease the youth and keep the truth
Pry open the bag, I finna bag me a beauty
The tree to free me from anxiety
Inside of me, a meet and greet with Mr. king of misery
Unleash the apathy I'm actually, done with the wrong and the rules
Kon is commutable
We're sharing the same particle

Strings longer than dreads on a rasta
You need to be higher to grasp the
Significance of the cancer
Causing you to close your third eye

[Bridge]
The two that you're using to rely, lies
Enlightenment the founder of truth, youth
Eternal learn you oughta be wise, I
Supersymmetry of the two, who
Owns the guitar tuning the tune, who's
Plucking each note toting the loom, who
Arranged the composition of you, who's
Smoking the potent herb in the room

""You know you fucked up right?
Look
You can't shoulder the whole world's sins
Listen""

[Verse 2]
I used to be the musician wearing the suit (Show)
I went to war, I was unstoppable (War)
Did some things, but I paid my dues (Karma)
Even the devil couldn't collect my soul (Grim)
Had to fight my way out of limbo (Limbo)
But ended up in a place quite remote (Judgment)
I must say these confines I'm not fond of
I really hope that Kon finds a place to go
A place to roam a place to stroll
I'm looking straight into the face of holy
Judge and jury face the fury
When the gavel hits the block I'm doomed
Well damn, it was fun while it lasted man
My story shall remain history in the museum
Stupid string theories and abstract thoughts

Just hurry up and send me away

Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend, corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

Now throw your hands in the air

Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool

Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God works in mysterious ways so when he starts
The job of speaking through us we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war okay

They tell me that temptation
Ooh, is very hard to resist
You tell me that you want me
I tried to hide my feelings, D-O-G's ain't supposed to feel like this
You can call it what you want to
But I don't even know what it is
You've got me singin' in the morning
You bring me breakfast in my bed and when it hurts you rub my head
I'll ask you one time only, baby
Won't you be there when it's hectic, when I don't have a hit record

I've traveled so many places, I've seen so many faces
And there were times I didn't think I'd make it through alone
I went through so many phases, that got me so many cases
Three strikes you're gone, then what you gonna do
I guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby
They tell me that crime is all I know how to do
Never leave me alone
Tell him his daddy's sorry, alone
Let him know all about me
There's one more thing I'd really like you to do

Man, somebody was naughty when they snitched on me
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county mainline
Back in 9500 just tryin' to handle mine
Spittin' game at the homies about the good ol' days
As we try to pass time waiting for the chain to Chino
I see no reason to cry but I miss my baby boo
And my nigga Spanky too
It's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid
Got me caught up in the rapture like maze, days gone by
And real G's gon' cry
But I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky
And hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside
But what's the chance that it ain't crackin'
If I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin'
I can't lie so I say I would, now my girl in a world of playa hood
A playa should show a nigga love and look out
But the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out
So keep away, better yet stay away
And hope I get out one day, okay
But if I don't, I guess this is home
My girl is trippin' she got a block on her phone

Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Leave me alone, never leave me alone

Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own
Never leave me alone, never leave me alone
Will I be left alone, all alone, on my own

Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin' to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

[Verse 2]
Jew-els and Cristal got him actin' funny style
He ain't watchin' you, he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when it's in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin' in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone with me?
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You got to try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

[Bridge: Total + LL Cool J]
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

[Verse 3]
So what you got the cash flow in escrow, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin' jacks throwin' rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down, now you Nino Brown
Rock roller with so much ice your cap's polar
I got her smokin' beedies, modeling bikinis
Pushin' your whip on the Van Wyck to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teaching shorty all the jewels that you never learned
Don't get it twisted, getting money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

[Chorus 4X: Total + (LL Cool J)]
Who do you love? (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure? (I do what I gotta do)

[Bridge: Total]
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (You know it's you)
Who do you love? Are you for sure? (Are you for sure?)

42,When You're Gone/Free To Decide,"St. John got gunned down with a cold .38
Why don't we pin him to the sky
The rarest of the specimens are neatly locked away
It's all in my collection
It's all in my collection

You know that bird has flown
Can you forgive?
A bird you'll never own

And your love is a graveyard where the grasses grow low
And the people that lie here knew just what you know
Now your shovel's a shot glass and you drink your own toast
You're living your life as a ghost, a ghost, a ghost

See your love is a playground where the grasses grow low
All the people that play here reap just what they sow
And if your shovel is a shot glass and you drink your own toast
You're living your life as a ghost, a ghost, a ghost

When your will is gone and dreams will erase
When you're hanging on by your fingernails
When your will is gone and dreams will erase
While you're hanging on by your fingernails

Bring out your finest wines your holy shrines and let them go
Freed from the chains of what has remained of a life that you don't want to know
The bass and the drums will hammer it home with their marching band of the proud
Celebrate ages, all life stages, seas and the winds and the clouds
The message's been written from your prison, see what tomorrow will be
See what tomorrow will be
See what tomorrow will be

Got every reason to believe that all must decide to break free
Was it a tantrum when you said that all the laughs were on me
Then I'll know my bet will win when the saints go marching in
Then I'll know my bet will win when the saints go marching in
Go marching in",Gazpacho,1996,"[44, 45, 48, 48, 52, 66]",6

Brizz vers' Ill, it's gon' be a-
Nigga, I am a crazy one!
And you nobody 'til somebody kills you: that's what Biggie taught
Think you can outrun these-
Nigga, you wanna live Ricky life?
Cause with this aim, I don't miss
Facts, pussy...Mickey wife
What you gon' do?
I'll make your jaw lean
Turn your life to a Saw scene
Head shot ya offspring
Red dots all over his face...now he Rosenberg Rawsteen!
But you the guardian of the Cave, right?
I still regard you as a sucka
.38 Special, I could be in the Olympics...(*smack*) with this retarded muhfucka!
I don't care if y'all 30 deep, it's still 30 actors
Get caught right in ya chest like Bill had on his jersey backwards!
Fuck Raw!
OK, let's turn up
Raw pussy: I ain't talkin' 'bout the best feelin'
Head spinnin', left his post traumatic like a vet symptom
We beef today? It better be USDA: fuck Raw!
I'm a slick puller
For the snow, man, I'll have you lickin' blood, Raw!
Why you be actin' so tough, knowin' you got that ho smell?
Nitty got up in Roc face...
Nigga, oh, well!
Comin' to the front like you gon' do somethin'...this ho frail!
Blac Youngsta: you coulda brawled with money at the hotel
.45 under the bed, I'm cheatin' on wifey wit' a cougar bitch
Off the first blast, I could merge cabs, have ya Uber Lyft
Do some shit!
My lil' nigga got the deuce-five on him
I said, ""Naw, I'ma cut him""
But he don't be listenin' to what I be tellin' this guy
So after I sliced him, he still shot him: that's a buck-seventy-five!
I'm in Pontiac, swaggin'
But I'm always in New York ready
I'll have Raw all over New York like New York Freddie
I been reppin'
If I see narcotics in ya men's section
You gon' see Ill in the cut like an infection!
I pack the .40
Don't act out in a act of glory
He got so many butts from the 12, they gave him statutory!
Cave Gang? Darkside!?
We couldn't be those geeks
I'd rather drink bleach for three whole weeks
You couldn't stop this chopper with Neo feet
I got somethin' new, all in
Ready to see Raw fish like a Creole feast!
He no beef, I could still cut him
I could cut him, but these swell victims
Took him out his shoes before the blade: I'm Ezal stealin'!
I toss my bitch the Dezzi
Yeah, my bitch'll roast you
Watch her stroke my ego like a bitch supposed to
I coast through, burn him with the Glock
Lottery pick: a .357 turn straight into a box!
Fuck nigga, actin' like he know he safe
The kickback throw Raw out the window like a police chase
Brizz, who is you steppin' to?
I will three-piece-suit you, schedule the service before the reverend knew
Only if Heaven knew, I could make life merge with Tekken 2
After I aah-aah-aah-ooh-aah-
BOY, THAT WAS LIKE, SEVEN MOVES!
Hi, Brizz! BOW! That's a .44 greetin'
Everybody buttoned up at the top and chess all open like a Cholo meetin'
You got kids? Well I'll hit ya son, split ya daughter, this a slaughter
Burn his chest, stab his leg, this is torture
Buck 50, buck 50, this is Sparta
I will slap whoever, I don't care if I'm in the 'Yac, where ever
If you gettin' money than Ill all over Raw chicken like salmonella
You act hard, but you still got some timid ways
Tim McVeigh, I blow up shit where ya kitten play
He decay if I lift the K, that's how a dentist play
He try to run and hit his head at the last minute like, ""Oh I know what I was finna say.""
This my day, I'm doin' everything my way
I'll give ya bitch a mud bath, it ain't a spa day
So how you want it? Ya jaw wired like Kanye?
Or the Wesside Gunn push ya shit to the side like Conway
You got heart dude? Let me get that
I know the nigga that taught you, don't forget that

And I ain't gon' play wit' him
Why I'm battlin' you? Well it ain't no explainin' it
From Ars' to Ill Will the fans see the bullshit and they ain't okay wit' it
Well, who OK'd the shit?
You got the iron cocked? Well you better strike when that iron hot
Cause I'ma leave a hole in Will (wheel) on the side of the road like that tire popped
All you gon see is pieces of Will (wheel) stacked in the garage like a tire shop
What's poppin' Willy?
Well it don't matter it's 12 o'clock, I'ma lift him up like we poppin' wheelies
That'll get in focus, fuck who hot, Brizz the coldest
I put dick in ya mother mouth, when I fly down with the zipper open
If there's somethin' in that shit you smokin'
I split you watch the guts fly out like when a Swisher open
Fuck whatcha mama think, you get ya mama shanked
Then get stuffed into a Mazda until ya mama stank
Wait, wait, wait, correct me if it's my mistake
But I kinda think he ain't climb the ranks
But ya makin' me (Jamaican) me wanna get uglier than Shabba Ranks
I brought four of these bitches to Set It Off, we ain't robbin' banks
Tonight, I'm ahead wit' weapons and I'ma leave ya head in sections
Live, In Living Color and sit ya face on the table like the Head Detective
BAOW! I blow the brains everywhere
I mean, I'm not sure if you heard but that's how I spread the message
Where ya kinfolk? Get ya chin broke

This pair is (Paris) from France, he gettin' French toast
You can spit folk, but you a bitch tho'
I can smell it I got a pit nose
I make ya mother suck dick three times then six mo'
I'ma keep talkin' shit 'bout ya mom and shit bro
Cause it's crazy how ya ugly ass mom fine as shit tho'
She get the dick fast, then get the dick slow
Then I'ma switch strokes, to a six stroke, then she dick choke
Wham! Then a rib broke
Y'all heard niggas bleed just like us?
Well today Somebody Gotta Die, that's a BIG quote
What you 6'4""?
Bitch, so?
You better dip low or get ya shit sewed like I stitch clothes
I bet whoever I see, see (CC) I ain't e-mailin' ya shit
I came for that smoke dawg like Ezal in this bitch
You from Pontiac, don't act like no female in this bitch
Cause for a grand damn (Grand AM) I clean Pontiac up like I'm detailin' a whip
Tell this crab, I'm the muscle (mussel) so if I see (sea) food I leave shells in the whip
You sad folk, ironic, you was shootin' up on SMACK then you fell off like bad dope
This vet' shit Ill, okay? I'mma drown you if you set trip, Ill
Don't be shocked when he's underwater, y'all better hope he's an electric eel (Ill)
Nigga these bullets got ya mama name on 'em like yo' electric bill

What are you jerks provin'? Be still
'Cause after my first movement, he get the gun to his dome
(*chk-chk*) Then the bullets through the temple - that's a church shootin'
See, Swave? I'm a Rare Breed
I come through fast at rare speed
One punch, clip through the wind and make the air bleed
He don't scare me
Let's be fair, Beas'
He had niggas fooled longer than Steve Harvey hair piece
But the can' I'm sportin' waves next to the hair grease
Tonight, I'm gettin' drunk off the open bottle like it's no tomorrow
But I gotta leave a round in Will bigger than a Forgiato
The Glock fresh out the box with no bodies like bony models
I heard yo' ass had a lot to say
Well Busta Rhyme yo' ass will get shot today
They'll ask did he (Diddy) get for real (Pharrell) wit' a nigga from the 'Yac?
I said, Pass The Courvoisier
Dezzi bird kickin' like cranes in the sky, shit feelin' like Solange today
Get the chalk for him, cause it's back to the chalk board
I bet the whole card hear it when I talk to him
Cause I'ma plug a knife in his top like an ox core
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
Bet the blade make the skull come out
When I bring it down like I'm talkin' loud
But, wait, wait, wait, I bring it back up like we got shit to talk about!
What's the deal Will? Let's get the deal sealed
I'll leave scars on his face like the real feel

[Round 2: Ill Will]
Can we have some fun just right quick?
Can your grandmother told me I had a great gene inside me hidin'
I couldn't keep it in
We both watch my kids fight fo' they life on the bed sheet dryin'
Rather than tryin' to beat the mind deep as a diggin' passages halfway to the core of pimpin'
When niggas was fuckin' nigga's mothers from the beginnin' of time and-
Let me be honest, if you text out every hoe that I've stretched out it'll be nothin' new
Just a double shot of smooth for ya boo and ya crew and I never have a bad drought
Y'all niggas came here on planes...cool, y'all gotta go the hotel route
They didn't even book my niggas rooms, I told 'em Brizz mama givin' head out

{Ill Will starts fake choking to further imitate Lux's first round versus Calicoe}
Hold on, let me get it together. Brizz mama givin' head out, Brizz mama givin' head out. Brizz mama givin' head out, what I say? Brizz mama givin' head out. What I say? Brizz mama givin' head out. Brizz mama was suckin' dick she was givin' head out. What I say? She grabbed on dicks and was suckin' 'em. She's a bitch that suck dick and she was givin' head out

Every nigga I fuck wit' thorough, just check the thread count
You talk shit, I walk shit
Spark shit, I would like to play a game: Saw 6!
I'm the bootleg man I'm givin' Raw clips
Good shotty, he a nigga I prolly catch slippin' in the hood prolly
You seen Guardians Of The Galaxy? You Groot, a nigga I would (wood) body
Black ratchets, nappin' (nappy)these hoes, it's too late for that Don Imus
Arm stuck in the shootin' position, aaaaw maybe it's arthritis
If I catch you, you dead, lay in the box silent
And send that coffin (coughing) to God, pray for my bronchitis
I don't see people, I just see dead things
.40 lickin', this pussy got his red wings
What's the biz here? I came to his mama house like, ""Is Brizz here?""
Two Dezi's, double D's squeeze tight in Brizz ear
You know, double D's squeeze tight in brazier
That shit was okay? A little iffy?
Well how 'bout I put the double D's on ya head like Little Nicky?
Ya boy is back, my respect? Don't toy with that
I come in, burnin' Brandon in the chest like he tryin' to join a frat
I will have a threesome witcha mama and yo' auntie Gladys
Stuff a cone while yo' mama toss yo' auntie's salad
Yo' pops show up, then mine do too
I'm the one shootin'
I had dick down her throat and I gave ya auntie the balls like I'm done hoopin'
Fuck you! Bitch ass nigga, I got a crazy mouth
I come in, deucin' ya woman and take ya baby out
Aye, get ya story right, we can have a gory fight like 40 nights
He gon' be the one to catch the big shot, livin' Horry life
Or this bitch can give him all she got, it's a supporting wife
I'm more than nice, hard headed, mom's had to say shit more than twice
Show up with more straps than C3 crib on orgy night
I'm more than nice, and I can take it a bit farther like I'm the shit starter
And these will get raised on Raw like Vince daughter
But you? Gas; Nazi victim
I see the Future in ya bitch; Scottie Pippen
Knock him down, he get the boot before the sock, I'm Ducati shiftin'
Dope, New Edition on the Brown handle, I'm Bobby sniffin'
Y'all know how y'all whoopin' a nigga ass, slip and fall and he get the best of you?
That's how Roc beat me, now I'm goin' ape
Hangin' these cats over the ledge I'm Rafiki
He can get a butt in the ring; Rikishi
These twins, but I only used to run wit' one in NY, it's not Tiki
Ya bitch? Wanna link up, I send my dude out to meet her
All she do is suck and fuck, this dude out to please her
I'll send them killers to ya home, we 'bout to make you move out and leave her
Or a chunk of raw meat in the seat like, ""Mom said take that Raw meat out the freezer.""
I'm skitzo Brizz, but right now, I'm in an okay mood
Sometimes I dream of cuttin' dope with the same knife that OJ use
BAOW! Tool hit you, he lose twenty whole liters
Don't play okay, our K's ain't studio speakers
I run down on him, right at the address
Bullets kickin' through the windshield; Pineapple Express
I ain't impressed
And T-Top, you keep talkin' 'bout the motherfuckin' drugs and you ain't got that motherfuckin' toy witchu?
You trappin' in silence, Vatican violence, I'll beat the pope out you if you got a lil' boy witchu
Smack, you got this boy witchu?
What you tryin' to add some relevance to him?
Now you got Raw behind bars like the evidence room
I step in this room with plenty arms, I bring many harm
Left this rat over Raw like Nicky Barnes
The reason why I walk around, prolly cause I don't know y'all probably
All y'all niggas is carbon Xerox, photocopies
I don't care if I'm alone, solo or deep as long as the fo' fo' got me
If yo' bitch run in front of this chopper it's gon' shred her (Shredder) I named it Oroku Saki
Yak Town in this bitch!

[Round 2: Brizz Rawsteen]
You know, you don't gotta tell me 'bout the .45 strap
And how the .9 clap, cause that's lies; facts
Where you find these guys at?
I mean besides that
Yo' last battle, you told Clips you be finger fuckin' a nigga til he climax
Right then I paused like, ""Why scrap?""
My nigga, where is yo' mind at?
Bitch I had to rewind that like ""Damn, that was a good line but why would rhyme that?""
What's up wit' this nigga? My machete catch you finger fuckin' a nigga
Cut ya hand off, now ya finger's stuck in a nigga
Faggot!
You got the game jacked up, you lame fat fuck, you ain't that tough
You fell off SMACK for two years to get ya name back up
You got in fake shootouts on camera to get ya fame back up
This ain't no step down for me Smack
Oh no, even though he did PG's and BET the year before me and won
Well look at us now for me Smack, huh
No,  you gotta check out the run down for me Smack
I proved I could kill DNA, DNA proved you wasn't a killer
I had a classic with Roc, you got ya ass whipped with Roc
I showed off on Showoff, Showoff showed off on you
I killed Arsonal, vers' Arsonal you lost that too
Man this is a step down for me Smack
I thought you was down with me Smack
But see rap, that's what I'm better at doin'
That's ya man, I'll have him lookin' like ya never knew him
When the shells on his back like the turtles but the metal on his head got him lookin' like The Shredder to him
When my bros find you, bitch they gon' clothes line you
That's a hole and whatever you rock or wear (Rocawear)
Then Roc will put the chain 'round his neck like Hov signed you
Check The Blueprint, I never been afraid
To say what's on my mind cause the M-16 (Em 16) got a magazine
That'll fuck up ya day like Jay on Renegade
Now versus Clips you had long rap rounds nigga
I got clips long enough to wrap 'round niggas
Yak Town, ya drunk ass better put the 'gnac down
Cause I'ma get Get Rich Or Die Trying and this .50 don't Back Down
These serve all day, catch a MAC round
I have his body hangin' halfway out the bag like a hash brown
We gotta get some thangs in order or I maintain some for ya
This .40 kick this bitch 100 feet away with a clip full of restrainin' orders
This stage? Not for William
I brought shots for William
Fuckin' up yo' posture William
Think Jeffrey, cause with Fresh prints (Prince) on the tre (tray) I Will Smith him like Master William
Fuck Yak Town, I'm a dark nigga
That dark nigga, tonight the Yak (gnac) get served by the bartender
I got single shots, double shots, but the tips for y'all niggas
You be rippin' niggas off, I be rippin' shit off niggas
I'll have more cats in his hood than Jaguar car dealers
If I declare war the deuce is wild but I still cut shit like card dealers
No no no, I target ya, like a Nazi at a bar mitzvah
And I ain't leavin' no prints that's what I brought mitts fa
Then I'm carvin' a, Swastika and a round in his top not a Yamaka
Then y'all niggas spit the flame in ya window like it's Hanukkah
Mazel tov, tell him, ""Knock it off"" or I give him mama raw
Cock with the condom off
You made it look easy on SMACK, now you just tryin' hard
This guy's a fraud, at NOME 6 you were smokin' our weed and ain't had no money to buy cigars
Talkin' 'bout ""They eight dollars.""
(Eight dollars)
Eight dollars!
What's the topic dawg?
How I'm Cave Gang and Roc the boss?
Cool, well 'til Roc get off stage I let a rocket off
Break shit, spaceship, the way ya top lift off
Chill Will before you get the Tylenol
That's a chill pill to put his brains on the tile and all
You said ya pops was from 3rd Ward Calliope then all over the projects, right?
Well you know if I catch him in the 3rd Ward this cal' will open shit all over the projects, right?
Cool, well stop playin' with the Cave
You dissin' us now, but that's lame to the Cave
At NOME 6, you really tried to hang wit' the Cave
But history shows, masters don't be hangin' with the slaves
You fucked up kid
Nah, you know what's fucked up is?
You got smoked twice, Smack passed on you, you know the rules nigga, puff puff give
You like the west coast in '97, boy you done fucked up BIG
So we gotta have a big discussion and you gon' get whipped for nothin'
If I don't catch him on the left I catch Will (wheel) on the right like a whip in London
Darkside nigga

[Round 3: Ill Will]
Aye Smack, I had to come up with these pop offs
I couldn't figure out which one was the best
I'ma help you out, you tell me which one you suggest
The first one you said, ""Nigga you fuckin' soft
I'll fuck ya mother in the ass and make her suck it off
All sorta options, I'm talkin' hand behind the head while his daughter watchin'

[Brizz]
Leg up

[Ill Will]

Aw nah!
But I scratch that Smack, I said, ""I don't like that pop off.""
Then I said, ""Nigga, I ain't Chilla. You can't call me for no Jakkboy Maine.""
Nigga I'll bang the steel, Ryda, ain't no rider, he need training wheels
Mike P, that's a pussy option

Shoot Chef like Johnny Depp, yeah nigga I got those

Cause nigga you said my name nigga and that ain't what we 'bout
I already shot up a Bigg K, we can clear the scene out
Motherfucka I'll put you on motherfuckin' 48 Hours, I'll bring the streets out
In other words Ave gon' be on A&E once I take the V out
But Smack, then I said, ""Fuck that.""
I balled that up, I said I can't spit it that way
Then I got back to you in a definitive way
Like, ""Nigga, I came out to damage you.""
You had to develop, I'm Ace Ventura I came out an animal
Y'all niggas wanna scrap?
Confrontation? I will smash dude, please
They gassin' you? We can take the shit outside like a bathroom key
You from the hood where they be like, ""Bro, that nigga crazy. He shady wit' his.""
I'm from the hood they be like, ""Bro, oh he crazy? Let's see how crazy he is.""
If I want you gone, you gone, it don't matter
Early/late, pearly gate, get ya girly ate
What you gon' do with that lil' pistol? Get sent to the Pearly Gates?
You ain't Michael Jordan, you can't play ill with that lil' .38
Raw? Raw nothin', if the Ross dumpin', Raw runnin'
Arm across his chest like, ""Hold on bro, a car comin'.""
Don't start nothin'

Hit him in his whip, left hangin' out that bitch like Smokey parkin'
I catch him Home Alone like Macaulay, let's have a hood run
Naw, on my mama I hang this brother over the ledge, but I'm the Good Son
You be actin' tough, but you still a timid bitch

And when he seen him comin' it wasn't even funny

[Brizz]
Facts

[Ill Will]
Well he was supposed to battle me that time
Shit I owed them niggas 'bout even money
But it wasn't 'grab me by my motherfuckin' neck like ""Nigga have you seen my money?'""
It wasn't ""No-no. Lock the door we ain't leavin' money.""
It was ""Leave that Yak nigga alone he can keep the money.""
What payment? I don't see the money
This ain't even funny but you keep it from me
Cause you NC niggas got runny lips
Don't make me come to North Carolina in disguised dreads and some bummy shit
Two .30's all what a tummy get
Netflix, Dave Chappelle, you get like 60 for that funny shit
Don't trip, I'm lit, and it's my day homie
And if I send fo' niggas to make a hit fo' ya mama it ain't [?] homies

You had a bunch of tongue ring bars that you escaped Alcatraz with
Then you ducked T-Top in that 106 BET champ shit
SMACK cut you off, you on the radio talkin' mad shit
Tweetin' all in his feelings like a mad bitch
See he was dancin', but, none of his punches was landin'
Then he tried to get Gully on KOTD, but it just wasn't Organik
Fuck the girl conversations
They know if I Blackout, it's gon' be World Domination
This a waste of my lines, I know, ya whole career, a big waste of yo' time

He ain't nice as the nigga said, so I need every slice of the nigga bread

Top said, ""Brizz cut it out."" I put a knife in the nigga head
All they seen was bodies on the Darkside, Night Of The Living Dead
Don't act violent, it's a MAC by him, but that's Mackk Myron

The guns got mo' bodies than human traffickers
So step Willie, this my house, you just a pet Willie
I walk this dog and let the white people pet Willie
A bullet long as a finger in ya ear it ain't Wet Willie
His body will wash up on the beach next to wet Willys
Fuck will power, I overpower Will
You ain't got no power Will
The kid will pull up with the toys these ain't power wheels (Wills)
Can y'all believe they said ""Will will smoke him""?
I said, ""You mean like when you do burnouts in the whip and the wheel be smokin'?""
Well bitch when I whip the burner out I bet Will be smokin'
To be blunt it's a wrap when we roll up, I bet Will be smokin'

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Said I don't wanna leave you lonely
You gotta make me change my mind

Baby, I got your number

You know that I called you, I called too many times
You can call me baby, you can call me anytime

I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me, they might take away my life
I just want someone to hold me, oh, and rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you and give you what you need
I said this youthful heart can love you
Oh, and give you what you need
But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

47,Thirty-Three,"[Verse 1]
Speak to me in a language I can hear
Humor me before I have to go
Deep in thought I forgive everyone
As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

[Pre-Chorus]
I know I'll make it, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth

[Chorus]
And you can make it last forever, you
You can make it last forever, you
Can make it last

[Verse 2]
And for a moment, I lose myself
Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world
I've journeyed here and there and back again
But in the same old haunts I still find my friends
Mysteries not ready to reveal
Sympathies I'm ready to return

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll make the effort, love can last forever
Graceful swans of never topple to the earth
Tomorrow's just an excuse
Tomorrow's just an excuse

From this view, I see colors: the blacks and the blue
Here comes another night (oh, no)
Without you, lookin' over the trees and the roofs
And I don't know what I would find

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know if you're even in the city
Don't know if you're even at home
Don't know who you're spendin' all your time with...

[Chorus]
But do you miss me at all?
Do you wonder what I'm up to without you?
Do you miss me at all?
Do you wanna leave a message on my phone
Sayin', ""I'm coming home.""?

In this room, you're the wallpaper
Sticks like glue into my memory
So do you think me over once in a blue moon?
'Cause you always rise to me

Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from my heart told only to the wind
Felt even without being said

[Chorus]
I don't wanna bore you with my troubles, yeah
But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet

I don't wanna bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you, more and more

That only our two hearts can find

But there's something about your love
That makes me weak and knocks me off my feet
There's something about your love, yeah

How you be calling me, getting fresh with me (She would leave!)

They all got stars in their eyes
Bars isn't tight
And their heart ain't never as hard as the hype
I'm what you like so
S-M [B] Smoke My Beef!
Dirty, let's get some pussy
I know you stash mad gash
Why don't you introduce me to three?
Nah fuck a groupie, it's time
London switched rap for dance music and grime
And they told me Brighton was hot
Brum and Bristol all up in the scene
No disrespect there's only Cambridge now see
Middle-East of the country, baby, hardest to please
Apart from Dike and Big Slang
They only really feeling Baxter and Key
And Mancunian
Don't feel no way nobody hating
Just what the fuck you're doing isn't entertaining
(Uh-huh. uh-huh)
Yeah swaggerdaddy can't jack it
Cause soon as you lean it forwards
I'ma lean it backwards on the track shit
Body motherfuckers, standard
A man ain't from where you from
You don't be rapping in my accent

[Verse 2: Stig of The Dump]
Guess who just got back from the boozer
Drinking himself into a stupor - loser!
Living pissed up without a view for the future
But still stay a step ahead just like my huge gut
You wanna know the truth bruv?
Pussy, weed and alcohol's the only things I do love
Plus I couldn't give two fucks!
Like having brewer's droop
While tryna twos up a crew slut!
It's rap's Larry David
The hatred made me take it back to the basics
My tongue twists like them K-Swiss Trainers
While these young pricks tongue-kiss their mate's anus
I ain't tryna make it famous
I do it to escape
Not for my name in the papers
Fuck the love of it
That ain't paying my wages
So if you don't know me
Don't ask me for favours
Laters!

[Verse 3: Jam Baxter]
Fuck the clichés, meet Jake the new baron
Spit a two-bar that renames your crew Sharon
You rappers move
I don't want your tunes, you have 'em
Loose cannon clashing like my garms
Rocking crew patterns
But I don't do fashion, I do talent
Do passion, do tracks
Do yats 'til their backs do spasms
Neck a few gallons of booze and lose balance
Hoof that and straight take off like your tune hasn't
There's a huge pack of crews rapping average
Who couldn't get their shit out with a huge pack of laxatives!
So you stand and grapple with your bodily deposits
My crew's back banging like the brothel in my closet
So please keep your mouth in the bottom of your pockets
When the CP's about, never bother with the gossip much
Hockin' up phlegm, set it off with the Dr. Skuff
Dike, Beats, Slang and Mr Constant, Drop it bruv!

[Verse 4: Skuff]
You are now in tune to Dikestar Delegates
And Contact Play while Mr. Constant selects the breaks
Rowdy like a mental case
On a lack of medication
That's except I don't fit like the threads I take
Anyway Contact Play spitting with delegates
Kick like that Ong-Bak brey
Missing his elephant
No one's a bad influence
I'm Mr. Mellowness
No girls that won't speak to me
Cause I'm a friend of his
We're just your everyday, common or garden hedonist
Some settled with kids, others are sexual terrorists
Or friends with benefits, depends on your opinion
If rap is your religion, I'm that heretic to wreck your kingdom
What d'you expect from this and that producer
I can tell it from the credits
I better ready the heavy future
You're now in tune to the old next level shit
Spit more, better and with much less respect, bitch!

[Verse 5: Dirty Dike]
My name's me and I'm the geezer from the ground floor
Sorta sound down, snort I'm not about war
I'm not allowed poor my dick takes the fucking piss
But I'd cut my wrists before I'd give up and love a bitch
I got drugs to sniff, big stuff to bloody shift
Big dubs to paint with my shitcunts and fucking pricks
Spliff bunnin in my room, trapped in
Planning tunes like I'm listening to New Jack Swing
I've heard the truth that's grim
It's dim lit and dark avenues
A shitstack of patterns with a binbag of have-to-dos
Think that I'm acting loose
It's pissflap the quackpig
I've been sick since Pissman the Captain
And still average wanking
I live by the slog
I'm a find a fuck pig
And have her dick behind the trunk[?]
""Agh Mr Dike's a cunt""
Stand up if you didn't like his stuff
Mouth shut and pull your fingers out your cunt

[Verse 6: Edward Scissortongue]
Call me the comatose cosmonaut
Cop a part cosmic
Break codes with a single thought
The Ice Age Ironman slowly thaws
With his ogre jaws standing so deep on the ocean floor
Rate my face twitch and the way my brain ticks
Limp-legged hunchback, billin fifty-eight spliffs
Until my face splits I spit bars that mean business
Like the shades of an agent in the matrix
May stick the same disc on every playlist
Where you play shit cause every track's amazing
And when someone's like (""Who the fuck is this?"")
It's a guaranteed fact that Mr. Scissortongue is playing
I'm moonwalking down your pavements
Rockin Hammer's crime fighting shoes
And looking like a vagrant!
Dancing with cavemen
Still seem to rinse some proper soulful rhythm and blues
Like the California Raisins

[Verse 7: Fliptrix]
It's the herb-thirsty writer
Cursing on Dirty's side and
Puffing on some durban that's certain to murkalise ya
Immersed in the earth slurp turf throwin fireballs
The way we're living is like we're not even hire-able
So being criminal is certainly more desirable
You want clean cut
Then a set of surgical knives will do
I'm getting higher than burglars
On the pergola
Getting into your world
And then sitting there disturbing you
Until you start to switch
Cause you thinking of turning murderous
It's too late for you
Some vultures done circled you
I still fly, chilling with that turbulence
I live life, a million and one purposes
The main two I service
A verballist-stroke-herballist
I kill you inadvertently
Triggering some emergency
They always think a pattern
I'm not a Doctor, why nurse that shit

[Verse 8: Leaf Dog]
With no ability they tried to see me
Blindfolded, walking the plank that leads to the sea
When I need herbs, like the third world needs rice
You need words, like a mask in a bank heist
Fuck a mic!
You can barely hold a conversation!
My rhymes have got the power to move you like immigration
Never mistaken, I was born in the wastebin
Mesmerised by the fucking snare that I'm chasing
Just waiting
For my album to be released
And my dick's up in your mouth
Like a swab from the police
[?] is a beast
He'll degrade you like a strip search
On some next shit like when you found out that your dick works
Your chance to spit first
My stance is stood perched
You're brain-dead like your real name was lurch
You switch up, used to love boom-bap
But like a junkie hit dick cause you scared of the old track

[Verse 9: BVA]
I've got thoughts running round my head like they're speeding
Fuck herbs, things could be much worse seeming
I'll never stop dreaming, time to stay believing
And naturally turn shit dark like an evening
I levitate, close my eyes like I meditate
Generate a heavy stone
Roam hitting better tapes
Here to take the something with real hip hop
To let everyone know it's time
Like really big clocks
Tick but don't tock
Lose the plot like a needle
The one's that you see looking fucked up
They're my people!
And keep what I speak true
Because the deep will
Make you want to get up
Go out and seek sequels
If I said I was a rapper
Would you preconceive
But I'd bet you'd get it totally different to what is me
If you want name dropping
I'm BVA MC

55,I'm Not Giving You Up,"To be completely honest
It scares me to imagine
What life would be without you

And for this very reason
I ask you to forgive me
For what I'm putting us through

Although there are so many things
Against us, I've decided
That I'm not giving you up, no...

Thinking back, I see what we have
Is something different
I think we've known all along
So how fair would it be
To divide this love's existence
Between what's right and what's wrong

And you, always wondering if we'll make it
Time will tell you
That I'm not giving you up, no, no...

We'll find a way to be together
However long it takes, wherever
If it means having you for only a moment
A moment just might be enough
I'm not giving you up, no
No I'm not giving you up, no

Screaming in the silence the promises we've spoken
Come back to haunt me, false and broken
Quiet desperation to see we're lost forever
Searching for water in the desert

No, I refuse to have to do
Without your kisses
I'm not giving you up, no, no

We'll find a way to be together
However long it takes, wherever
If it means having you for only a moment
A moment just might be enough
I'm not giving you up, no

Too busy showing love
Why you steady take
Show you what's up in my heart
Let me meditate
But actions all I demonstrate
See that's ya problem I guess you'd just rather seal ya fate
New beginnings I stay winning from start
Women grinning I may start sinning look at the God
Not flashy
Still not one can pass me
Empty compliments but my drive is all that could gas me
Treasure to most, but some calling me trashy
I'm just to complex they ask me
How could you come from this class see
Well, I was student
Just watching em flashing
She said you think you just fancy
I told her woman don't sass me

While I'm up in my feelings, I'm merely filling my millions
I mean up to the ceilings
Hey mama look at her chillins
When I'm finished I want em all to still give her this feeling
Oldest, but though I'm willing to shift all my focus to the youth it just seem like they hopeless
Through my music yes I'm talking to you
Yes I'm talking to the youth
Though I'm solo in this booth
Youngins still brush it off like they holding on to a tooth

And follow my words til this land end

I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Bridge]
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

62,Desperately Wanting,"[Verse 1]
Passed the road to your house
That you never called home
Where they turned out your lights
Though they say you'll never know

[Refrain]
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting

[Verse 2]
When they pumped out your guts
Filled you full of those pills
You were never quite right
Deserving all the chills
Said the worst is over
Take it over again
Then they ask what went wrong
When they turn you on again
Don't they turn you on again

I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting

[Verse 3]
Kick them right in the face
Make them wish they weren't born
If they bring up your name
Well they'll say you won war
Baby burst in the world
Never given a chance
Then they ask what went wrong
When you never had it right
No you never had it right

[Refrain]
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting
I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind
Both of us never tiring
Desperately wanting

Oh, the letters I've dropped off
Though they say you got them all
Finally figured out some things you'll never know
Take back your life
Let me inside
We'll find a door
If you care, if you care to anymore

I remember running through the wet grass
Falling a step behind

66,"Bohemian Rhapsody (From ""High School High"")","[Verse 1: Dirty J]
Well, my, hat brim might be worn a little too low
You're too slow, what the fuck do you really think you know
I do so, and every rhyme that I spit is just so crucial
Like Metamucil, I kill some rhymes that I'm used to
You park so high and mighty, but I'm not mighty high
Duddy smoke you out with weed and leave your mouth fucking dry
Cause some of them rappin', clappin', laughin'
Always beer tappin', fuckin' dorkette slapping
Be ridiculous at how I'm trippin'
Is all I'm thinking is this the best MC that you can find
I shine like some moonlight through the pine
Yo, and even if you were wine
I'd still stay dope up with my line

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
Well if you generally irie
Then roll with the stylie
Duddy ""smokin' Cali green leaf 'til I die"" B
Leave me alone when I'm chilling in my home
Yo, I'm smooth like a Schwinn and I shine like the chrome
Of its fender, remember this microphone defender
Return your shit to sender cause no one wants to hear it
Yo, your lyrics are weak and yes your spirit's meek
And you an ignant motherfucker, yes it shows when you speak
You're a wicked disappointment, your rhymes need some ointment
The crowd at your shows always laughing and pointin'
Leavin' and blewin', my boy has been groovin'
And I'm still backstage just smokin' and boozin'
Confusin' the sets, save the best for my choosin'
I'm choosin' the rest so you're losin'

[Verse 3: Dirty J + Duddy B]
Well, don't forget about the down and dirty southern Cali flow
Just open the melody and let the rhythm go
I'm hoofing up the track just like a bouncing antelope
And soften up your Skoal just like a ripened cantaloupe
Because the west (west) coast (coast) knows how to kill it
Yo, and y'all (y'all) know (know) when its time to feel it
Yo, we make it right (make it right)
So we up all night (up all night)
Until it's tight (until it's tight)
Until it's tight (until it's tight)
A bohemian rhapsody, these syllables after me
With lyrical chastity and verbally blasphemy
The illest we have to be, with musical masterpiece
So come on and clap with me, so come on and clap with me
(So come on and clap with me)
Just come on and clap with me
(So come on and clap with me)
Yo, just come on and clap with me

[Verse 4: Dirty J]
Once upon a time in the neighborhood
There was a little dirty boy that was up to no good
He had a chip in his tooth and a mic in his hand
He had a dirty-ass head from the beach and the sand
He said, I just got out of the water and I'm late for school
I asked Duddy to skip and he said, that's cool
So we went to the liquor store, got ourselves some Magnums
Rollin' down the street, yeah, you know we brown bagged 'em
With the 50s on top and the 20s on bottom
Said we rollin' through my hood, yeah, you know we got 'em
Sucker MCs wanna battle me, but that's okay
I tell 'em, don't fuck around because we don't play
I sang rock out with my cock out, I got balls of steel
Hear me clanking down the street like a bag of beer
Said the dance off session, gonna start right here
Duddy B, grab the wheel, cause I can't steer
You got 20-inch rims and they spinnin' when you stop
Said I don't give a fuck, kill it when the beat drops
Cause that's what I respect, to all you knuckle heads and derelicts
Just jammin down the sound with the syllables and intellect
Maybe not the intellect, but the syllables are clean
And I leave you in the desert with an empty canteen
While I be rippin' shows from here to Galapagos
And I be pickin' foes like I'm pickin' a fro
And all you chicken head hoes
That come to picket my shows
You got to go",Dirty Heads,1996,"[68, 61, 53, 42, 43, 46, 48, 51, 53, 55, 55]",11

To be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment

I don't who you are anymore

Than be trapped in this

I don't know what I want anymore

I move across, candy floss
I move like a tank
I move across the room with a heart full of gloom
I'm stronger than you think
Oh, my peer, your veneer
Is wearing thin and cracking
The surface informs the underneath
The underneath is lacking

Than be trapped in this
How easy you think of all of this as bittersweet me

I couldn't taste it
I'm tired and naked
I don't know what I'm hungry for

You move across, innocence lost
All static and desire
You're blue in the face from navel gaze
You set yourself on fire
You strip down and lay yourself out
I know you can't fake it
But are you tired and naked?
Oh, are you tired and naked?

Prevent every downfall on this world because you made

I am here just today, for everyone you hurt
Don't get me wrong, oh you are such an awesome place to live
But it is man and it is the way he thinks
It is his attitude and faith in nothing
Everyone believes that only miracles can change everything

And so they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing
So they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing

For them it seems impossible to make their dreams come true
They always need some evidence, a hero like me and you

What do you see when you look into my eyes
What do you feel when your mind connects with mine
I really hope you believe in me, you made me the hero of the day
Where will I be when darkness kills the light
Who will be there to save one thousand lives
Tomorrow we all will be, together the heroes of the day

There is not much inside us that has to be changed
But even a different way of thinking can change everything
If others do the same, you won't believe what we could achieve
We could create a new community with no heroes
Cause we're the heroes of the day

And so they all need a wakeup call just to crash the walls
Which still surround their faith in nothing

'Cause that's just what we have in mind
Is that alright with you
Now, this is a tune that I composed
And it's called
Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman
Now I never intended recording this song
It was a personal poem
This is until the day that my producer
Happened to thumb through the pages of my notebook
He came across the words and he said
'We got to somethin' with these words
It's happening every day
And people wanna hear about it, Betty'
You see, it's the story of a young girl
Making love for the very first time
Now when I finally got a melody
I took it home and I-I played it for my mother
Now I got to tell you a little bit about my mother
You see I come from one of those pretty large families
And I'm the baby of the family
And you know you never grow up to your mother
I'll never forget the way she looked at me when I played it for her
She said, 'Uh, I like the music
You know, baby, the melody it's really nice
But I know you're not gonna sing that song'
But we eased it right on by, yes, we did
And it became one of my biggest records too
So I want you to do this for me if you will
Everybody think back to your very first time
Now I'll give you a little while longer
'Cause I know some of you
Have to think back a little further than others
Come on now, I want you to play catch-up
'Cause I don't want you waitin' till I get to the end of my song
Sayin', 'Oh, yeah, now I remember'
Now whether it was good
Or you just smilin' it was good
Or on the other hand if it was not so good
Here's my story

Hmm...hmm...mmm...mmm...

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, mmm...mmm...

I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
I'm tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still, no

I can hear your car door slammin'
I wanna play big girl and put on a sexy smile
But I know so little about what love is
I just can't help actin' like a child

You're knockin' on my door and you're ringin' my bell
Hope you're not impatient after waiting so very long
A whole year I put you off with my silly hang-ups
And we're both old enough to know right from wrong

Tonight is the night
That you make me a woman, mmm...
You said you'll be gentle with me
And I-I hope you will, hmm...mmm...
I'm nervous and I'm tremblin'
Waitin' for you to walk in
Tryin' hard to relax
But I just can't keep still

Mmm...hey, baby
Ho, ho, baby
Ho...yeah...yeah...

Oh, but what if my mama should come home early
And catch us doin' what we're doin'
Not only will I never live it down
But my whole family relationship it'll all be ruined
But we've gone a little bit too far now
Oh, to turn around
So let's just pray
That true love is what we've found

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Ho, I'll never forget tonight
No, no, I'll never forget tonight
That's when you make me feel real, mmm...hmm...
You make me feel real, real good
Oh...oh...whoa...oh...oh...whoa...whoa...
Yeah, and I wanna thank your love
Said I've got to thank your love
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
I love you and I know it
And I ain't too proud to show it
'Cause I love you, baby
And I need you, baby
I want you, my love, my love
My, my, my baby
I'll never forget tonight
No, I'll never forget tonight
'Cause you make me feel good
And I love you, baby
You make me feel real good
And I love you, baby
'Cause you gave me
Uh, uh, pure love, yeah
Uh, uh, uh, pure love
Said I like that, baby
Uh, uh, pure love
Said I need that, sugar
Uh-uh-uh, pure love
There's nothin' phony about it
Uh-uh, pure love
Your love I can't do without it
Uh-uh-uh, pure love, ooh

I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it
I ain't too proud to show it
I love him, I know it

75,Nowhere To Go,"[Intro: Sample]
Are you alone?
No one's out here
Are you alone?
No one's out here

[Verse 1]
Same day, started as the last one
Nothin' changed, kind of hoping it's a fast one
Now my mates man, I hardly ever see 'em
I know they feel I changed but I'm feelin' like I'm dreamin'
Now when we drink up, we reminisce and laugh
I'm feelin' bad, I'm out it but they still stuck in the raw
Weighin' drugs on a scale just to pay bills
Plus the boys doing time, how do they feel
No matter what, I am stuck in the gutter
Money can't change shit, it's my brain motherfucker
If I had enough bills, I'd get all the crew fed
But I gotta feed the fam and remember you said
You had my back, well I'm needing the support
Try and move but I crash, plus I'm fiendin' just to talk
Nobody want to listen so I'm walking these dead streets
Feeling like the only thing that knows is a Nebs beat
What the fuck you thinking, 'cause I got fans now
That I don't need your help? Fuck, I'm putting the pen down
Wait I can't do that, 'cause that's the shit right
This the medicine that's going to save a kid's life
But I talk about drugs, so now I'm no good
Show your parents what the fuck around your own hood
Then maybe just maybe you'll fucking understand why
And hate me but rate me and the exact same time, 'cause I

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all
And yeah, I feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

[Verse 2]
I could be drug fucked, that would make sense
You try to hold the weight I'm holding, it would break legs
Cones that I've packed, every tab that I've popped
On the phone to my dad, but he don't know that I'm lost
'Cause I play it all good, no one needs to know shit
Don't know if I should, don't know why I wrote this
Feeling so confused, why the fans showin' love?
Why I'm writing shit like this, does it mean I'm growing up?
If that's the fucking case, I'd rather feelin' like a kid again
When we was running mucks I probably had them people listenin'
Nowadays, it's not the same, or tell me is this what the fame
Is doing to my brain? I've gone insane, I need a doctor mate
I got a lot at stake, I gotta stop it ayy
They tell me drop the pills, I end up fuckin' popping eight
I got my girl and thank fuck for that
I love her, need her 'cause I'm losin' all my trust in rap
Plus she found my fucking stash and she flushed it down the toilet
Next day, I went and scored, don't talk about it, I avoid it
Where to go? What to do? 'Cause I'm lost, what?
Now these haters gonna use it as a soft spot
But what's not to say that you is not the same
Somehow I'm in my right mind but I lost my brain
That's my heart, sittin' served up on the paper
I fucked up and saved nothin' for later

[Hook]
Feel alone like there's nowhere to go
I try to find a home but I'm back on the road
Another mate rang but I missed the call
So you can use your fuckin' brain but you ain't thinkin' at all

77,Naked Eye,"Take a little dope
And walk out in the air
The stars are all connected to the brain
Find me a woman
And lay down on the ground
Her pleasure comes falling down like rain
Get myself a car
I feel power as I fly
Oh now I'm really in control

It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Don't happen that way at all

You sign your own name
And I sign mine
They're both the same but we still get separate rooms
You can cover up your guts
But when you cover up your nuts
You're admitting that there must be something wrong
Press any button
And milk and honey flows
The world begins behind your neighbor's wall

It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Nah nah no, don't happen that way at all

You hold the gun
And I hold the wound
And we stand looking in each other's eyes
Both think we know what's right
Both know we know what's wrong
We tell ourselves so many many many lies
We're not pawns in any game
Not tools of bigger men
There's only one who can really move us all

It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all

79,At Night I Pray,"So alone
And this room feels so cold
No one to care and no one to hold
Yeah, the Lord knows
That I'm needing somebody like you
Just like you

Can you see the passion burning in my eyes?
Do you sense the rush you give my heart
And if you knew the secret way I feel for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine
All mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray

Should I feel these emotions inside me
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul
I'm so afraid
But it's something that you've got to know

How I want to touch you every time you're near
I long to feel your body next to mine
And if you knew the secret love I have for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine
All mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray

If all my prayers were answered
Our hearts would be enraptured
We would find our heaven inside each other's arms
This lonely room would finally see the sun shine through

But until that day
Every night I'll pray
I'll get down on my knees
I'll get down on my knees and pray...

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time
You'll be mine
All mine

And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes

80,All I Want,"[Verse 1]
I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily

[Chorus]
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay",Olivia Rodrigo,1996,"[82, 82, 82, 85, 95]",5
81,I Can Make It Better,"[Verse 1]
Well, once again, my love
It's time for you to go
No need to explain anything
I know, I know, I know
This is the end of the road
It's the parting of the ways
And there's not much left for us to say

You keep telling me he's no good for you
You said you were gonna change your lock
You told me if he bothers you again, baby
He'll be dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Put him away, baby
Make him understand
Tell him his game is over
And then when you cry, I'll be your shoulder

[Chorus]
Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Tell him you want to be free, you want to love me
Don't let him get in the way, hey hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
For every one time that he gives you pleasure
Ten times he makes you wanna cry
You spend every night with the toss and the turn, baby
And wonder why in the world, oh why
How in the world can you get any sleep?
Everyone knows the way that he creeps
It's time for the question, baby
What has he done for you lately? So baby...

[Chorus]
Whenever you want me to
I can make it better
I just need this one chance to prove it to you
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a pawn in his game
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Or darling, it's just a shame

[Bridge]
Better for you is better for me
Let's fall in love, and I'll make you see, baby
Better for you is better for, better for me, baby
Let's fall in love, I'll make you, I'll make you see

[Verse 3]
Never again will you hear a lie
Never again will you wanna cry
Never, oh no, will there be a teardrop in your eye
Stop all this madness in the name of love
Tell him to leave 'cause enough is enough
Let him go, baby, and you can save your love for me
Tell him you've found somebody
Who'll give you the love that you just won't believe

[Chorus]
Whatever you're going through
I can make it better
No one should be making you feel like you do
I can make it better
And oh baby, baby
Don't be a link in his chain
Go 'head and tell him it's over, tell him to go
Oh darling, it's just a shame

It's better for you, ooh, better for you
(I can make it better for you)
Better for you, so much better for you
(I can make it better, yeah, babe)
Better for you, yeah yeah, better for you
(I can make it better for you)
Better for you, hey, better for you

Sell grills in a field with heads that need it
Pour the cuts and oka?, but 50 can't feed it
Read it and weep
Deep like whole bitch grown on
Phenomenon, table one, diamond dusk dawn,  ride on
Tracks from end to end like a trolley
Wheelin’ like a Harley
Smokin’ Bob Marley
With mad, badder than your cousin from the Group Home
Nuff' chrome, stuck fan, leavin’ spots blown
Niggas need to shut the fuck up and take notes, I said it
Make them cats float like boats, unquote

Fuck havin’ blocks on lock

Come up with plans to expand
Take ov-’ your whole neighbourhood
I’m givin’ clearance to Clarence, I hope the reverend bless my mic
Instead of riding my dick van dyke

Givin’ you somethin’ to witness like raw deal

What it takes to beat competition, position
The key, watch the O.N.E. and the O.N.E. make the path wider
Can you follow me? Not a criminal, I won’t get loud and rip
Just don’t play me too close, you'll put yourself at risk
Got a bunch of niggas names on my shit list
And one day when I’m pissed, I’ll take care of this

I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this aging game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand

[Chorus]
And oh babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh oh babe, you could make history young again

[Verse 2]
I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterdays news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time

So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent

I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That’s part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to smother and beat them
My god, what a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end

Okay, so while Macklemore was keeping his room nice and neat (Yeah)
I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even we if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear 'ol dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face

91,Birmingham,"My Dear Fellow Clergymen:

While confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities ""unwise and untimely."" Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would have little time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no time for constructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statements in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms.

I think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham, since you have been influenced by the view which argues against ""outsiders coming in."" I have the honor of serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization operating in every southern state, with headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty-five affiliated organizations across the South, and one of them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights. Frequently we share staff, educational and financial resources with our affiliates. Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct-action program if such were deemed necessary. We readily consented, and when the hour came we lived up to our promise. So I, along with several members of my staff, am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties here.

But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their ""thus saith the Lord"" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.

Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial ""outside agitator"" idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.

You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham. But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations. I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro community with no alternative.

In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps: collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; negotiation; self-purification; and direct action. We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham. There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community. Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. Its ugly record of brutality is widely known. Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts. There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of the case. On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers. But the latter consistently refused to engage in good-faith negotiation.

Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham's economic community. In the course of the negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants--for example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs. On the basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations. As the weeks and months went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained.

As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us. We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we would present our very bodies as a means of laying our case before the conscience of the local and the national community. Mindful of the difficulties involved, we decided to undertake a process of self-purification. We began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we repeatedly asked ourselves: ""Are you able to accept blows without retaliating?"" ""Are you able to endure the ordeal of jail?"" We decided to schedule our direct-action program for the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the main shopping period of the year. Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change.

Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoralty election was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action until after election day. When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene ""Bull"" Connor, had piled up enough votes to be in the run-off, we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run-off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues. Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after postponement. Having aided in this community need, we felt that our direct-action program could be delayed no longer.

You may well ask: ""Why direct action? Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?"" You are quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word ""tension."" I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood.

The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogue.

One of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely. Some have asked: ""Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?"" The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.

We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct-action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied.""

We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God-given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, ""Wait."" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son who is asking: ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?""; when you take a cross-county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ""white"" and ""colored""; when your first name becomes ""nigger,"" your middle name becomes ""boy"" (however old you are) and your last name becomes ""John,"" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title ""Mrs.""; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ""nobodiness""--then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.

You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One may well ask: ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others?"" The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that ""an unjust law is no law at all.""

Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a man-made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an ""I-it"" relationship for an ""I-thou"" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation is not only politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.

Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the same token, a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself. This is sameness made legal.

Let me give another explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation laws was democratically elected?

Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structured?

Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.

I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.

Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience. In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act of civil disobedience.

We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was ""illegal."" It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's antireligious laws.

I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.

I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.

In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber.

I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: ""All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth."" Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.

You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained of self-respect and a sense of ""somebodiness"" that they have adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who, because of a degree of academic and economic security

And because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation, the largest and best-known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible ""devil.""

I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate neither the ""do-nothingism"" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle.

If this philosophy had not emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced that if our white brothers dismiss as ""rabble-rousers"" and ""outside agitators"" those of us who employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in black-nationalist ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmare.

Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides--and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact of history. So I have not said to my people: ""Get rid of your discontent."" Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this approach is being termed extremist.

But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you."" Was not Amos an extremist for justice: ""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream."" Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: ""I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus."" Was not Martin Luther an extremist: ""Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me God."" And John Bunyan: ""I will stay in jail to the end of my days before I make a butchery of my conscience."" And Abraham Lincoln: ""This nation cannot survive half slave and half free."" And Thomas Jefferson: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal . . ."" So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be extremist for the preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?

In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire need of creative extremists.

I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed themselves to it. They are still too few in quantity, but they are big in quality. Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as ""dirty nigger-lovers."" Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need for powerful ""action"" antidotes to combat the disease of segregation.

Let me take note of my other major disappointment. I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.

But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.

When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass windows.

In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.

I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: ""Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother."" In

The midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: ""Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern."" And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other-worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.

I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South's beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious-education buildings. Over and over I have found myself asking: ""What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?""

Yes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique position of being the son, the grandson and the great-grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformists.

There was a time when the church was very powerful--in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed. In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being ""disturbers of the peace"" and ""outside agitators""' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were ""a colony of heaven,"" called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God-intoxicated to be ""astronomically intimidated."" By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests.

Things are different now. So often the contemporary church is a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So often it is an archdefender of the status quo. Far from being disturbed by the presence of the church, the power structure of the average community is consoled by the church's silent--and often even vocal--sanction of things as they are.

But the judgment of God is upon the church as never before. If today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century. Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust.

Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic. Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith to the inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true ekklesia and the hope of the world. But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from

The paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They have gone down the highways of the South on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times. They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of disappointment.

I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood. We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of history, we were here. For more than two centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation--and yet out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands*.*

Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statement that has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ""order"" and ""preventing violence."" I doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department.

It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they have conducted themselves rather ""nonviolently"" in public. But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends. But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot has said: ""The last temptation is the greatest treason: To do the right deed for the wrong reason.""

I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering, and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy-two-year-old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ""My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest."" They will be the young high school and college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience' sake. One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts and pray long prayers?

If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me.

I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beauty.

I don't need your love, no, no
It'll never be better than it was, no, no

I've got no choice
With the King I stay alive
Never had a choice
Been a wife twice before, just to survive
I don't have a choice
If Henry says ""It's you"", then it's you
No matter how I feel
It's what I have to do
But if, somehow, I had that choice
No holding back, I'd raise my voice

I'd say, ""Henry, yeah it's true
I'll never belong to you

97,Follow You Down/Til I Hear It From You,"[Verse 1: Canibus]
I think fast, switch fast, quick fast, quick as
Immigrants say, ""No habla ingles"", at border-patrol fences
Messin' with Canibus is senseless
Divide my senses by six and you'll end up with triple sixes
And triple the digits mean triple the spirits
My light body to the third power will triple my lyrics
I'm triple the threat, I'm triple my physical flesh
I'm telling you, put your money on me, then triple your bet
‘Cause I won't be satisfied 'til I'm set
'Til I got a triplex out in Tribeca with the skyline effect
Rhyming is the nine-to-five that I manipulate best
Eight hours of writing and memorizing a manuscript
Called ""The Biography of Canibus,"" subtitled ""The Ultimate Guide for Teaching Modern Man How to Spit""
How to tongue-twist, how to enunciate certain shit
How to control your breath, how to make your syllables spit
Y'all niggas ain't listen to Bis, I kill ‘em with shit
I'm wicked with this, I should be selling tickets to this
Paparazzi should probably be taking pictures of this
My fans in the street with signs tryin' to picket for this
Saying, ""We want ‘Bis! We want ‘Bis!
We want the rapper with the illest lyrics!""
My dedication and my commitment's beginning-less
I can go four quarters or nine innings for this
Go twelve rounds, play two days of cricket for this
Lead crusades across Europe, like the Christians for this
The notion I'm dedicated is an understatement
My rhymes are out of this world like the Russian space-station
Sneak-attack rappers, grab 'em and slash 'em
Chop their heads off with claws sharper than velociraptors
Hunt 'em, like Jurassic Park actors
But spare Samuel Jackson's life
‘Cause he was the only black one
Action-packed like Shaft, the black assassin
Blastin' the .753 backwards Magnum
Follow me down the road to Damascus
Do not follow these madmen, poppin' ecstasy pills like aspirin
I and I come fe manifest the most high
Drink a gallon of cyanide and still cannot die
Niggas want to lock the ‘Chronicles of Canibus' away forever
And put my book of rhymes through a shredder
Never, I'm way too clever the way I manoeuvre
Beat your ass, like Lennox Lewis did to David Tua
In front of a hundred-million pay-per-viewers
Your career is ruined
Your face will be swollen, like the Benihana Buddha
Bring it to ya, prove you're a loser
Beyond the length of this rhyme you have no future
Pounce upon you, like a puma or some wild cougars
In the jungle with my adrenaline juices flowing through 'em
I'ma reprogram everything that you're doin'
Hypnotize the audience you perform in front of to start booin'
You're stupid, you and your whole crew are extremely foolish
I can't cipher with you, ‘cause your breath is too putrid
Put your mic down and step away from it!
Shut your motherfucking mouth and don't say nothin'!
You have the right to remain silent
Sentenced to life on Rikers Island for terrible freestylin'

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I heard a rumor English women make love the best
Is that true? ‘Cause I ain't had no justice yet
A lot of clowns keep arguing on who the best is
Bite the style but can't digest it
'Til they get karate-kicked in the mouth
And their teeth get ejected
Told you to watch who you beef with on the last record
Platinum teeth? I sell them for a thousand pounds a piece
You buy one back and you get one free
Put it down in the East, put it down in the West
Put it down on paper, put the paper down on the desk
In the studio is where I put it down to the test
It's nothing but skull-crushing pressure down at them depths
Throw a rough mix down, download it to disk
Give a copy to everybody that's down with Bis
Since '96, the Dogg Pound Remix
First time anybody put me down to spit
It's like Pac Man, don't stop, 'til I hear my voice
Banging up and down the block in a Magnavox
With a hundred watts
Creating ripples in the water, like aquanauts
Breathing through their oxygen-box
I belong on top of the pops, not on the bottom with rocks
I mean, honest to God, I'm shocked
I thought the album was hot
I guess you can't write an infinite rhyme with a finite mind
That's why rhymes like mine mystify mankind
A lot of rappers are ahead of their time
But when it comes to rhymes like mine
The word ""time"" doesn't apply
You see, rhyming is the art
The microphone is the paintbrush
Responsible for getting the point across
The canvas is the street, where the Master of the Ceremony paints the picture for everybody to see
Nobody could rhyme this fluent
Nobody ever did what I'm doin'
Nobody ever spit what I'm spewin'
I'm the illest alive and I'ma prove it, plus I've got to show the people that I've got mad love for Rap music
I bury MC's with rosary beads
A picture of their wife and their seeds and a picture of me
I'm as graceful as the left hand of Rembrandt
Put some instrumentals on
And ask my pen to dance; I'm such a gentleman
Pull out chairs, open doors, never offend my fans
Unless they offend me and I lose my temper, man",Canibus,1996,"[44, 45, 40, 45, 48, 47, 46, 42, 44, 43, 43, 45, 48, 43, 39, 37, 33, 33, 30, 27, 27, 30, 33, 27, 22, 20, 19, 17, 14, 11, 10, 11, 12, 10, 11, 13, 10, 11, 9, 9, 9, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12]",46
98,Who Will Save Your Soul,"[Verse 1]
People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your souls when it comes to the flowers now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da da da

[Verse 2]
We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war
Another tower went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your souls when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La da de da de da la da da da da

[Verse 3]
Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

100,"Touch Myself (From ""Fled"")","I dined by appointment with one of our most trusted agents, in a private chamber at St. James’s Hall. You have seen the man: it was M’Guire, the most chivalrous of creatures, but not himself expert in our contrivances. Hence the necessity of our meeting; for I need not remind you what enormous issues depend upon the nice adjustment of the engine. I set our little petard for half an hour, the scene of action being hard by; and the better to avert miscarriage, employed a device, a recent invention of my own, by which the opening of the Gladstone bag in which the bomb was carried, should instantly determine the explosion. M’Guire was somewhat dashed by this arrangement, which was new to him: and pointed out, with excellent, clear good sense, that should he be arrested, it would probably involve him in the fall of our opponents. But I was not to be moved, made a strong appeal to his patriotism, gave him a good glass of whisky, and despatched him on his glorious errand.

Our objective was the effigy of Shakespeare in Leicester Square: a spot, I think, admirably chosen; not only for the sake of the dramatist, still very foolishly claimed as a glory by the English race, in spite of his disgusting political opinions; but from the fact that the seats in the immediate neighbourhood are often thronged by children, errand-boys, unfortunate young ladies of the poorer class and infirm old men—all classes making a direct appeal to public pity, and therefore suitable with our designs. As M’Guire drew near his heart was inflamed by the most noble sentiment of triumph. Never had he seen the garden so crowded; children, still stumbling in the impotence of youth, ran to and fro, shouting and playing, round the pedestal; an old, sick pensioner sat upon the nearest bench, a medal on his breast, a stick with which he walked (for he was disabled by wounds) reclining on his knee. Guilty England would thus be stabbed in the most delicate quarters; the moment had, indeed, been well selected; and M’Guire, with a radiant provision of the event, drew merrily nearer. Suddenly his eye alighted on the burly form of a policeman, standing hard by the effigy in an attitude of watch. My bold companion paused; he looked about him closely; here and there, at different points of the enclosure, other men stood or loitered, affecting an abstraction, feigning to gaze upon the shrubs, feigning to talk, feigning to be weary and to rest upon the benches. M’Guire was no child in these affairs; he instantly divined one of the plots of the Machiavellian Gladstone.

A chief difficulty with which we have to deal, is a certain nervousness in the subaltern branches of the corps; as the hour of some design draws near, these chicken-souled conspirators appear to suffer some revulsion of intent; and frequently despatch to the authorities, not indeed specific denunciations, but vague anonymous warnings. But for this purely accidental circumstance, England had long ago been an historical expression. On the receipt of such a letter, the Government lay a trap for their adversaries, and surround the threatened spot with hirelings. My blood sometimes boils in my veins, when I consider the case of those who sell themselves for money in such a cause. True, thanks to the generosity of our supporters, we patriots receive a very comfortable stipend; I myself, of course, touch a salary which puts me quite beyond the reach of any peddling, mercenary thoughts; M’Guire, again, ere he joined our ranks, was on the brink of starving, and now, thank God! receives a decent income. That is as it should be; the patriot must not be diverted from his task by any base consideration; and the distinction between our position and that of the police is too obvious to be stated.

Plainly, however, our Leicester Square design had been divulged; the Government had craftily filled the place with minions; even the pensioner was not improbably a hireling in disguise; and our emissary, without other aid or protection than the simple apparatus in his bag, found himself confronted by force; brutal force; that strong hand which was a character of the ages of oppression. Should he venture to deposit the machine, it was almost certain that he would be observed and arrested; a cry would arise; and there was just a fear that the police might not be present in sufficient force, to protect him from the savagery of the mob. The scheme must be delayed. He stood with his bag on his arm, pretending to survey the front of the Alhambra, when there flashed into his mind a thought to appal the bravest. The machine was set; at the appointed hour, it must explode; and how, in the interval, was he to be rid of it?

Put yourself, I beseech you, into the body of that patriot. There he was, friendless and helpless; a man in the very flower of life, for he is not yet forty; with long years of happiness before him; and now condemned, in one moment, to a cruel and revolting death by dynamite! The square, he said, went round him like a thaumatrope; he saw the Alhambra leap into the air like a balloon; and reeled against the railing. It is probable he fainted.

When he came to himself, a constable had him by the arm.

‘My God!’ he cried.

‘You seem to be unwell, sir,’ said the hireling.

‘I feel better now,’ cried poor M’Guire: and with uneven steps, for the pavement of the square seemed to lurch and reel under his footing, he fled from the scene of this disaster. Fled? Alas, from what was he fleeing? Did he not carry that from which he fled along with him? and had he the wings of the eagle, had he the swiftness of the ocean winds, could he have been rapt into the uttermost quarters of the earth, how should he escape the ruin that he carried? We have heard of living men who have been fettered to the dead; the grievance, soberly considered, is no more than sentimental; the case is but a flea-bite to that of him who should be linked, like poor M’Guire, to an explosive bomb.

A thought struck him in Green Street, like a dart through his liver: suppose it were the hour already. He stopped as though he had been shot, and plucked his watch out. There was a howling in his ears, as loud as a winter tempest; his sight was now obscured as if by a cloud, now, as by a lightning flash, would show him the very dust upon the street. But so brief were these intervals of vision, and so violently did the watch vibrate in his hands, that it was impossible to distinguish the numbers on the dial. He covered his eyes for a few seconds; and in that space, it seemed to him that he had fallen to be a man of ninety. When he looked again, the watch-plate had grown legible: he had twenty minutes. Twenty minutes, and no plan!

Green Street, at that time, was very empty; and he now observed a little girl of about six drawing near to him, and as she came, kicking in front of her, as children will, a piece of wood. She sang, too; and something in her accent recalling him to the past, produced a sudden clearness in his mind. Here was a God-sent opportunity!

‘My dear,’ said he,

‘would you like a present of a pretty bag?’

The child cried aloud with joy and put out her hands to take it. She had looked first at the bag, like a true child; but most unfortunately, before she had yet received the fatal gift, her eyes fell directly on M’Guire; and no sooner had she seen the poor gentleman’s face, than she screamed out and leaped backward, as though she had seen the devil. Almost at the same moment a woman appeared upon the threshold of a neighbouring shop, and called upon the child in anger.

‘Come here, colleen,’ she said,

‘and don’t be plaguing the poor old gentleman!’

With that she re-entered the house, and the child followed her, sobbing aloud.

With the loss of this hope M’Guire’s reason swooned within him. When next he awoke to consciousness, he was standing before St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, wavering like a drunken man; the passers-by regarding him with eyes in which he read, as in a glass, an image of the terror and horror that dwelt within his own.

‘I am afraid you are very ill, sir,’ observed a woman, stopping and gazing hard in his face.

‘Can I do anything to help you?’

‘Ill?’ said M’Guire.

‘O God!’ And then, recovering some shadow of his self-command,

‘Chronic, madam,’ said he:

‘a long course of the dumb ague. But since you are so compassionate—an errand that I lack the strength to carry out,’

he gasped

‘this bag to Portman Square. Oh, compassionate woman, as you hope to be saved, as you are a mother, in the name of your babes that wait to welcome you at home, oh, take this bag to Portman Square! I have a mother, too,’ he added, with a broken voice.

‘Number 19, Portman Square.’

I suppose he had expressed himself with too much energy of voice; for the woman was plainly taken with a certain fear of him.

‘Poor gentleman!’ said she.

‘If I were you, I would go home.’ And she left him standing there in his distress.

‘Home!’ thought M’Guire, ‘what a derision!’

What home was there for him, the victim of philanthropy? He thought of his old mother, of his happy youth; of the hideous, rending pang of the explosion; of the possibility that he might not be killed, that he might be cruelly mangled, crippled for life, condemned to lifelong pains, blinded perhaps, and almost surely deafened. Ah, you spoke lightly of the dynamiter’s peril; but even waiving death, have you realised what it is for a fine, brave young man of forty, to be smitten suddenly with deafness, cut off from all the music of life, and from the voice of friendship, and love? How little do we realise the sufferings of others! Even your brutal Government, in the heyday of its lust for cruelty, though it scruples not to hound the patriot with spies, to pack the corrupt jury, to bribe the hangman, and to erect the infamous gallows, would hesitate to inflict so horrible a doom: not, I am well aware, from virtue, not from philanthropy, but with the fear before it of the withering scorn of the good.

But I wander from M’Guire. From this dread glance into the past and future, his thoughts returned at a bound upon the present. How had he wandered there? and how long—oh, heavens! how long had he been about it? He pulled out his watch; and found that but three minutes had elapsed. It seemed too bright a thing to be believed. He glanced at the church clock; and sure enough, it marked an hour four minutes faster than the watch.

Of all that he endured, M’Guire declares that pang was the most desolate. Till then, he had had one friend, one counsellor, in whom he plenarily trusted; by whose advertisement, he numbered the minutes that remained to him of life; on whose sure testimony, he could tell when the time was come to risk the last adventure, to cast the bag away from him, and take to flight. And now in what was he to place reliance? His watch was slow; it might be losing time; if so, in what degree? What limit could he set to its derangement? and how much was it possible for a watch to lose in thirty minutes? Five? ten? fifteen? It might be so; already, it seemed years since he had left St. James’s Hall on this so promising enterprise; at any moment, then, the blow was to be looked for.

In the face of this new distress, the wild disorder of his pulses settled down; and a broken weariness succeeded, as though he had lived for centuries and for centuries been dead. The buildings and the people in the street became incredibly small, and far-away, and bright; London sounded in his ears stilly, like a whisper; and the rattle of the cab that nearly charged him down, was like a sound from Africa. Meanwhile, he was conscious of a strange abstraction from himself; and heard and felt his footfalls on the ground, as those of a very old, small, debile and tragically fortuned man, whom he sincerely pitied.

As he was thus moving forward past the National Gallery, in a medium, it seemed, of greater rarity and quiet than ordinary air, there slipped into his mind the recollection of a certain entry in Whitcomb Street hard by, where he might perhaps lay down his tragic cargo unremarked. Thither, then, he bent his steps, seeming, as he went, to float above the pavement; and there, in the mouth of the entry, he found a man in a sleeved waistcoat, gravely chewing a straw. He passed him by, and twice patrolled the entry, scouting for the barest chance; but the man had faced about and continued to observe him curiously.

Another hope was gone. M’Guire reissued from the entry, still followed by the wondering eyes of the man in the sleeved waistcoat. He once more consulted his watch: there were but fourteen minutes left to him. At that, it seemed as if a sudden, genial heat were spread about his brain; for a second or two, he saw the world as red as blood; and thereafter entered into a complete possession of himself, with an incredible cheerfulness of spirits, prompting him to sing and chuckle as he walked. And yet this mirth seemed to belong to things external; and within, like a black and leaden-heavy kernel, he was conscious of the weight upon his soul.

I care for nobody, no, not I,
And nobody cares for me,

he sang, and laughed at the appropriate burthen, so that the passengers stared upon him on the street. And still the warmth seemed to increase and to become more genial. What was life? he considered, and what he, M’Guire? What even Erin, our green Erin? All seemed so incalculably little that he smiled as he looked down upon it. He would have given years, had he possessed them, for a glass of spirits; but time failed, and he must deny himself this last indulgence.

At the corner of the Haymarket, he very jauntily hailed a hansom cab; jumped in; bade the fellow drive him to a part of the Embankment, which he named; and as soon as the vehicle was in motion, concealed the bag as completely as he could under the vantage of the apron, and once more drew out his watch. So he rode for five interminable minutes, his heart in his mouth at every jolt, scarce able to possess his terrors, yet fearing to wake the attention of the driver by too obvious a change of plan, and willing, if possible, to leave him time to forget the Gladstone bag.

At length, at the head of some stairs on the Embankment, he hailed; the cab was stopped; and he alighted—with how glad a heart! He thrust his hand into his pocket. All was now over; he had saved his life; nor that alone, but he had engineered a striking act of dynamite; for what could be more pictorial, what more effective, than the explosion of a hansom cab, as it sped rapidly along the streets of London. He felt in one pocket; then in another. The most crushing seizure of despair descended on his soul; and struck into abject dumbness, he stared upon the driver. He had not one penny.

‘Hillo,’ said the driver,

‘don’t seem well.’

‘Lost my money,’ said M’Guire, in tones so faint and strange that they surprised his hearing.

The man looked through the trap.

‘I dessay,’ said he: ‘you’ve left your bag.’

M’Guire half unconsciously fetched it out; and looking on that black continent at arm’s length, withered inwardly and felt his features sharpen as with mortal sickness.

‘This is not mine,’ said he.

‘Your last fare must have left it. You had better take it to the station.’

‘Now look here,’ returned the cabman:

‘are you off your chump? or am I?’

‘Well, then, I’ll tell you what,’ exclaimed M’Guire;

‘you take it for your fare!’

‘Oh, I dessay,’ replied the driver.

‘Anything else? What’s in your bag? Open it, and let me see.’

‘No, no,’ returned M’Guire.

‘Oh no, not that. It’s a surprise; it’s prepared expressly: a surprise for honest cabmen.’

‘No, you don’t,’ said the man, alighting from his perch, and coming very close to the unhappy patriot.

‘You’re either going to pay my fare, or get in again and drive to the office.’

It was at this supreme hour of his distress, that M’Guire spied the stout figure of one Godall, a tobacconist of Rupert Street, drawing near along the Embankment. The man was not unknown to him; he had bought of his wares, and heard him quoted for the soul of liberality; and such was now the nearness of his peril, that even at such a straw of hope, he clutched with gratitude.

‘Thank God!’ he cried.

‘Here comes a friend of mine. I’ll borrow.’ And he dashed to meet the tradesman.

‘Sir,’ said he,

‘Mr. Godall, I have dealt with you—you doubtless know my face—calamities for which I cannot blame myself have overwhelmed me. Oh, sir, for the love of innocence, for the sake of the bonds of humanity, and as you hope for mercy at the throne of grace, lend me two-and-six!’

‘I do not recognise your face,’ replied Mr. Godall;

‘but I remember the cut of your beard, which I have the misfortune to dislike. Here, sir, is a sovereign; which I very willingly advance to you, on the single condition that you shave your chin.’

M’Guire grasped the coin without a word; cast it to the cabman, calling out to him to keep the change; bounded down the steps, flung the bag far forth into the river, and fell headlong after it. He was plucked from a watery grave, it is believed, by the hands of Mr. Godall. Even as he was being hoisted dripping to the shore, a dull and choked explosion shook the solid masonry of the Embankment, and far out in the river a momentary fountain rose and disappeared.",Robert Louis Stevenson,1996,"[93, 96, 96, 84, 86, 90, 77, 69, 71, 71, 69, 61, 64, 51, 47, 47, 40, 46, 56, 88]",20

It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
'Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

Then I loose myself, juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and um
Self-centered niggas'll take two pulls cause they thinking about self and um

'Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels, Girbaud, flexing one five oh
Chop up that paper, ho, chop up that paper, ho
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp, doe
Get involved in the backseat

Well, a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the open lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
Have them looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
'Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a ho to let my fellas run a train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick
Thinking me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word no was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the feds or spitting game, but it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'mma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp-type shit that Belo and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a ho wanna holler, then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same ho to wanna freak your friends

103,"Why Does It Hurt So Bad (From ""Waiting To Exhale"")","[Verse 1: George the Poet]
Your boyfriends about to become your ex-boyfriend
Them lonely nights won't be nice so its sex toys then
See he wears the trousers
Thats where the deep held power dwells
Unfortunately theres no female parallels
It's a man's world, why would we help ourselves?
He strolls in smelling like female shower gels
Insulting your intelligence
Asking what's the relevance of the fact you've never seeing Radox in this place
He needs a box in his face
You're like, if your gonna cheat
At least be weary and clever
We did the shopping together
You bought Imperial Leather
Furthermore, who smells so fresh at 3pm?
And where's your precious BBM?
That phone always seems to be on infront of me
But I can never seem to reach you on it, funnily
No, you weren't at the gym
Cause where's your gym bag?
Where's the tension in your muscles you thin slag?
On Whatsapp your last seen every 5 minutes
Until i've got something to say
I'm sick of tryna guess who your fucking today
Who your tucking away
But see I'm stuck in a way
Cause I love you to death, but I hate this for the life of me
Why can we not have the most basic of privacy?
Why does she have to leave traces that I can see?
Why don't you put in any effort when you lie to me?
So I don't find scratches on your back
Why is there no dry patches on your back?
You barely cream a leg if I don't scream and beg, so tell me
Which one of them ratchets on your sack
With a mattress and a flat , just gave you a massage
You wasn't waved, you wasn't charged
So you definitely remember
I'm making an effort
No I'm making an effort to keep my temper
But I don't know why you're stuttering
Maybe your chocking on a lie your uttering
But listen, if I find the slut again
I won't cry i'll cut her skin

(Do you know how crazy you sound right now)

[Verse 2: George The Poet]
Apart form lazy, you're downright foul
See the drama breaks your boredum
You find it kinda live
If your day consisted of a more than a minor a 9 to 5
You wouldn't stay so twisted and flawed
You would find some kinda drive
Instead of obsessing over having a man to squeeze
Coming up with these elaborate fantasies
Getting mad at different women
You need to get over your Dad and just forgive him
Yeah, I know
I know you had it bad in the beginning
But every ones dealing with the challenges of living (challenges of living)
I know your dad hurt you with his callous disposition
And his is malace of a villian
But it's not my fault that a gyallis is within him
If I'm chattin' to a gyal, this isn't sinning
Ey why are we having the same conversations that we had in the beginning?
A year and a month in
(Is my patience not appearing to run thin, or is there just a problem with your hearing or something?)

[Hook 1]
If the shoe fits wear it boy
(If the shoes fits, I can't fucking take it)

[Verse 2: George the Poet]
Nah that's too much disrespect for you, fuck swallowing pride
How can such a massive prick, be so hollow inside?
He don't even see this as an issue to attend to
He don't resent you, and he won't pretend to
You fight, he leaves, cause thats what men do
Part of you wants to follow his ride
But all hope for tomorrow has died
You kinda wanna catch him dating a next girl
Cause you're sick and you're tired of waiting to exhale
And set sail for the stress within
You even get selfless and message him
After you, use to be selfish and mess with him
Hours rolling by
First it's slow replies, now it's no reply
But after a night of violent drama
You would rather just find some kind of karma
A knight in shining armour
Now that's when you realised i was golden guy
So you move like a spy, Austin Powers: Golden eye
Left your girlfriends place to get yourself some space
You never told a lie but you never told her why
Don't deny, You was coming to my road alie?
Yeah
Tears gave you swollen eyes
Mandem on the corner try holla at you
But they see you walk to my door
And I know them guys
So there momentary hoping and scoping dies
That's when I open up, arms open wide
Go chat to the mandem, alright
Go inside, take off your coat and pride
Our eyes coincide (yeahh)
I ask myself
Does she really wanna talk?
And I found no answer
Other than  it's probable
But if you was with your girls
Coming to me to talk about man trouble isn't logical
I get a blanket from the cupboard
Thinking sod it all
You can't stand it getting smothered and you sob some more
I know your in a little muddle and it's horrible
That's okay lets just cuddle in this corridor
Come here
I found you on the verge of disillusion
But you
Came here in search of a solution
Flesh on your body in perfect distribution
The fact he thinks hes worth it is amusing
What he's a player?
This niggas losing
If I was him i'd be vexed for real
Look at the sex appeal, your figures oozing
Please don't think this is standard customer service
I ain't tryna make you feel flustered and nervous
Even though you're sweet, you ain't just a dessert
Cause without the cake, the custard is worthless
I know it feels good to be understood
But if someones got to do it, I'm the one that should
So let me take away the pain
It's never too late to play the game
(It's never too late to play the game)
Then after the screams and tangled legs
The bubble baths and the beans and scrambled eggs
You won't feel bad
How scandalous is this?
That will teach him not to handle his business

[Hook 2]
You better be careful what you say to me
(Fucking fool)
Cause it might turn around on you
You better be careful what you do to me
Cause somebody might do it to you

[Verse 2: Jesy Nelson + Trevor Dahl with Leigh-Anne Pinnock]
Did I let go of your hand for a castle made of sand?
Ooh, that fell into the blue
I went following the sun to be alone with everyone
Ooh, looking 'round a crowded room

And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

110,Strawberry Wine,"[Verse 1]
He was working through college
On my grandpa's farm
I was thirsting for knowledge
And he had a car

Yeah, I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river on a well-beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last

[Chorus]
Like strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

[Verse 2]
I still remember
When thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
When he had to go

A few cards and letters and one long distance call
We drifted away like the leaves in the fall
But year after year I come back to this place
Just to remember the taste

[Chorus]
Of strawberry wine and seventeen
The hot July moon saw everything
My first taste of love, oh bittersweet
The green on the vine like strawberry wine

[Bridge]
The fields have grown over now, years since they've seen a plow
There's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much?

My first taste of love, oh bittersweet

111,Elevators (Me & You),"[Verse 1: André 3000]
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move
But we not making no G's and that's a no-no

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playin, they payin, we stayin, layin vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me
I'm out this bitch

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dicks now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82
Me and you like Tony Toni Tone

Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat so we like neck-to-neck

No one's gonna love you like I do

I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Verse 1: Witt Lowry]
Yeah, here I go again, you must think that I'm lame
Remembering back to us talkin' on AIM
And stealin' your heart, that was never my aim
See I let you leave and now nothing's the same
I'm pickin' your brain, you pick me apart
I'm pickin' your heart, you left me in dark
I guess all the pain and the hurt and the worry you left me
Returned in the shell of a star
Damn, do we end arm in arm, or are we Armageddon?
Guess you'll never know cause you never let him
Show you how he love and he trusts and he care
But all of it showed, but you never were there
So let's really see if you cared
Knew if you needed then he would be there
To put all the blame onto you isn't fair
But all you care 'bout is your makeup and hair
You're takin' a selfie, I'm takin' your shit
I see all your pics, I see who you picked
And just know, it eats me alive you're happy with him
That you're happy with him
Damn, I'm jealous, creepin' through your Instagram
And find myself askin' why the fuck that I still give a damn
About you, about us, like Mark—give her the fuck up
And although I hate his guts, I gotta give your man that thumbs up
'Cause he was bringing you close
Now he's with the one who I'm wanting the most
One minute I hate you, one minute I love you
Well, right now I'm writin' and feelin' 'em both, I can't stop

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

[Verse 2: Witt Lowry]
When I was given this beat, immediately, thought about you
Cursed with the hurt, it's a wonder I found you
Stuck here, I'm drinking and thinkin' about you
All of my friends say I'm better without you
Better without you, right?
Thought I found you on a darkest night
Could've shown you what a red carpets like
Rode up on a dark horse, the darkest knight
And the girls flowin' like water now
I wanna give 'em my heart, but it's watered down, and
And, honestly, let's keep it real
See, I'm just jealous that you found love
And I'm searchin' for it still
All of these girls are dry and lame
I want complex so that we can build
Nothing's out of my league, you ain't in my lane
And whenever we talk, now it's never the same
Being put in your friend zone is bringin' me pain
And I just wanna get you up out of my brain
Out of my brain… never been one for past tenses
And so know that I'm moving forward before I finish this sentence
I crumble when in your presence, rent time in my mind like tenants
So sorry I'm so offensive, it's hard just being your friend
And in the end I look stupid, the time I spent was useless
The truth is, honestly, girl, I miss you, and...

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same
I can't stop drinking about you
I gotta numb all the pain
I can't stop drinking about you
Without you I ain't the same

116,How Do U Want It/California Love,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered

Seven weeks have passed now since she left me

Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy."" I said

I wondered how you felt about it?"" I said

Saw my lawyer, Mr Good News
He got me joint custody and legal separation

[Chorus 2]
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears
I'm laughing through my tears

I took a walk alone last night
I looked up at the stars
To try and find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me
I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected

[Verse 5]
The park is full of Sunday fathers and melted ice cream
We try to do the best within the given time
A kid should be with his mother
Everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit sometimes?

I saw that friend of mine, he said
""You look different somehow""
I said, ""Everybody's got to leave the darkness sometime""

128,"Insensitive (From ""Bed Of Roses"")","Chapter 17

The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition. He continued,

""You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede.""

The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me.

""I do refuse it,"" I replied; ""and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.""

""You are in the wrong,"" replied the fiend; ""and instead of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance. But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of your birth.""

A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently he calmed himself and proceeded—

""I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do not reflect that YOU are the cause of its excess. If any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a hundredfold; for that one creature's sake I would make peace with the whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realized. What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!""

I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument. His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of feeling and continued,

""If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me, I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.""

""You propose,"" replied I, ""to fly from the habitations of man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man, persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed, and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction. This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.""

""How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints? I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that with the companion you bestow I will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.""

His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathize with him, I had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow.

""You swear,"" I said, ""to be harmless; but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge?""

""How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.""

I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice caves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request. Turning to him, therefore, I said,

""I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe forever, and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.""

""I swear,"" he cried, ""by the sun, and by the blue sky of heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall appear.""

Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice.

His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I exclaimed, ""Oh! Stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.""

These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me.

Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a mountain's weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them. Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream, and that thought only had to me the reality of life.",Sms_MaryShelley,1996,"[42, 39, 38, 34, 30, 31, 31, 26, 21, 19, 19, 18, 14, 14, 16, 17, 15, 16, 17, 17, 16, 12, 12, 12, 16, 16, 18, 19, 26, 35, 38, 46, 53, 57, 63, 71, 74, 87, 94, 96]",40

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away

Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby

Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me

You'll always be my baby, baby, baby

How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks

You forgot me when I was losin', so forget me when I’m winnin'
Where the dark day was frenzing me 'til the day they be friended me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It’s hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies

For them I got that remedy, kill 'em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I’m blessed
My comeback’s they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn’t really with me all the way - I’ll be okay

137,Blue,"[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

138,All I See,"[Verse 1]
And it's so typical of me
To be so cynical of you
I just keep running 'round in circles, babe
And yet I haven't found a clue
A way to get around you, no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I don't know why
But I'm mesmerized by your broken eyes
(By your broken eyes)
But I can't complain
When I go insane as I call your name
(As I call your name)

[Chorus]
And all I see is you next to me
A ghost of you tangled up in my sheets
It weighs me down to this ocean floor
I know I'll drown yet I'm begging for more

[Verse 2]
I could feel you move and hear you breathe
I could wear this heart out on my sleeve
You could break my bones and watch me bleed
I would do it all again
I could hear it in the way you speak
That you're reaching out as much as me
That you're searching for your way out
And you're dying just to live

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I don't know why
But I'm mesmerized by your broken eyes
(By your broken eyes)
We've got this road
And we both know where it's bound to go

And all I see is you next to me

It weighs me down to this ocean floor
I know I'll drown yet I'm begging for more

I don't know why
I'm mesmerized
I can't complain

[Chorus]
And it's what I want, not what I need
A shadow of you that's been haunting my dreams
It eats me up from the inside out
It's on the tip of my tongue and won't leave my mouth

139,If I Ruled The World,"[Hook]
If I ruled the world
I'd love all the girls
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 1]
If I ruled the world, was king on the throne
I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home
I'm not running for Congress or the President
I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went
You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome
And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home
And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention
Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions
It took a few years 'fore the day had come
But I was ruler of the world ranked #1
So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown
Let the whole world know that the King was in town
As I arrived the crowd started to cheer
And then someone yelled out, ""The King is here!""
So I headed toward stage to make a speech
About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls
If I ruled the world

[Verse 2]
People started flowing as they reached for my hand
I said, ""Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land
But now I must go, so goodbye to everybody
Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party""
And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party
I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: ""La-Di-Da-Di""
The music started ending, it was time for a speech
The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet
And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd
But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud
Excuse me please for stopping this show
I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so
My first day in office, the King on the throne
I spent my first three hours on the telephone
You know with newsmen reporters, and voters too
I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do
You know hours passed I continued to work
I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt
Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing
'Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king!

[Hook]
If I ruled the world (huh huh, huh huh huh)
I'd love all the girls  (I'd love em love em baby!)
Wear diamonds and pearls (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
If I ruled the world (whoa whoa yeahhhhh)

{AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit}

[Verse 3]
Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top
And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped
And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong
And to you sucker MC's that sing my song
And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong
And I'ma rock it to you baby baby all night long
And it's a song about love and happiness
In a world of peace and you know that's fresh
Now I'm the king and I want you to know
That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show
And to all of you rappers in every country
You better stop what you're doing and listen to me
'Cause we gotta stop war and use unity
To fight crime and hunger and poverty
'Cause the African baby is dying overseas
While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's
Huh, 20 million people all unemployed
While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd
While the working class just struggles hard
Try to make ends meet against all odds
While the poor man can't even deal with life
You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe
And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way
'Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day
So LISTEN UP world while I teach this class
And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last
'Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution
Of woman and man to just join the revolution
That'll take your brain to a higher plane
And help you deal in a world that's gone insane
With the problems that I know we can stop
From the ruler of the world and the man on top
But the years went by, and time was up
And then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck
And all the people at the time who said they were my friends
Didn't know me when my job had come to an end
The King who took my place was happy as can be
He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali
So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door
On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

There's a destination a little up the road
From the habitations and the towns we know

Pulling out jives and jamboree handouts
Two turntables and a microphone
Bottles and cans just clap your hands
Just clap your hands

[Verse 2]
(Take me home with my elevator bones!)
(That was a good drum break)
Pick yourself up off the side of the road
With your elevator bones
And your whip-flash tones
Members only hyponotizers
Move through the room like ambulance drivers
Shine your shoes with your microphone blues
Hirsute with your parachute fruits
Passing the dutchie from coast to coast
Like my man Gary Wilson (rocks the most)

141,E-Bow The Letter,"[Verse 1: Michael Stipe]
Look up and what do you see? All of you and all of me
Fluorescent and starry, some of them, they surprise
The bus ride, I went to write this, 4:00 a.m, this letter
Fields of poppies, little pearls all the boys and all the girls
Sweet-toothed, each and every one a little scary
I said your name, I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars
Hash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras
Dreaming of Maria Callas, whoever she is
This fame thing, I don't get it
I wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it
Maybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves
I can take you far, this star thing, I don't get it

[Chorus: Patti Smith and Michael Stipe]
I'll take you over, there
I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over
It tastes like fear
I'll take you over


[Verse 2: Michael Stipe]
Will you live to 83? Will you ever welcome me?
Will you show me something that nobody else has seen?
Smoke it, drink, here comes the flood, anything to thin the blood
These corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet
Phone, eat it, drink, just another chink
Cuts and dents, they catch the light
Aluminum, the weakest link
I don't want to disappoint you, I'm not here to anoint you
I would lick your feet, but is that the sickest move?
I wear my own crown of sadness and sorrow
And who'd have thought tomorrow would be so strange?
My loss, and here we go again

[Chorus: Patti Smith and Michael Stipe]
I'll take you over, there
I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over
It tastes like fear, pulls us near
I'll take you over

[Verse 3: Michael Stipe]
Look up and what do you see?
All of you and all of me, florescent and starry
And some of them, they surprise
I can't look it in the eyes, seconal, Spanish fly, absinthe, kerosene
Cherry-flavored neck and collar
I can smell the sorrow on your breath
The sweat, the victory and sorrow, the smell of fear
I got it

[Chorus: Patti Smith and Michael Stipe]
I'll take you over, there
Aluminum, tastes like fear
Adrenaline, it pulls us near
I'll take you over, take you there

I'll take you over, take you there
It tastes like fear, pulls us near
I'll take you over, take you there

A long look in the mirror
Tell me baby if things don't look

148,"Because You Loved Me (From ""Up Close & Personal"")","The End Of The Fete

HE WOULD NOT SEE ME. He had shut himself up and was writing. At my repeated knocks and appeals he answered through the door:

""My friend, I have finished everything. Who can ask anything more of me?""

""You haven't finished anything, you've only helped to make a mess of the whole thing. For God's sake, no epigrams, Stepan Trofimovitch! Open the door. We must take steps; they may still come and insult you....""

I thought myself entitled to be particularly severe and even rigorous. I was afraid he might be going to do something still more mad. But to my surprise I met an extraordinary firmness.

""Don't be the first to insult me then. I thank you for the past, but I repeat I've done with all men, good and bad. I am writing to Darya Pavlovna, whom I've forgotten so unpardonably till now. You may take it to her to-morrow, if you like, now merci.""

""Stepan Trofimovitch, I assure you that the matter is more serious than you think. Do you think that you've crushed some one there? You've pulverised no one, but have broken yourself to pieces like an empty bottle."" (Oh, I was coarse and discourteous, I remember it with regret.) ""You've absolutely no reason to write to Darya Pavlovna... and what will you do with yourself without me? What do you understand about practical life? I expect you are plotting something else? You'll simply come to grief again if you go plotting something more....""

He rose and came close up to the door.

""You've not been long with them, but you've caught the infection of their tone and language. Dieu vous pardonne, mon ami, et Dieu vous garde. But I've always seen in you the germs of delicate feeling, and you will get over it perhaps—après le temps, of course, like all of us Russians. As for what you say about my impracticability, I'll remind you of a recent idea of mine: a whole mass of people in Russia do nothing whatever but attack other people's impracticability with the utmost fury and with the tiresome persistence of flies in the summer, accusing every one of it except themselves. Cher, remember that I am excited, and don't distress me. Once more merci for everything, and let us part like Karmazinov and the public; that is, let us forget each other with as much generosity as we can. He was posing in begging his former readers so earnestly to forget him; quant à moi, I am not so conceited, and I rest my hopes on the youth of your inexperienced heart. How should you remember a useless old man for long? 'Live more,' my friend, as Nastasya wished me on my last name-day (ces pauvres gens ont quelquefois des mots charmants et pleins de philosophie). I do not wish you much happiness—it will bore you. I do not wish you trouble either, but, following the philosophy of the peasant, I will repeat simply 'live more' and try not to be much bored; this useless wish I add from myself. Well, good-bye, and good-bye for good. Don't stand at my door, I will not open it.""

He went away and I could get nothing more out of him. In spite of his ""excitement,"" he spoke smoothly, deliberately, with weight, obviously trying to be impressive. Of course he was rather vexed with me and was avenging himself indirectly, possibly even for the yesterday's ""prison carts"" and ""floors that give way."" His tears in public that morning, in spite of a triumph of a sort, had put him, he knew, in rather a comic position, and there never was a man more solicitous of dignity and punctilio in his relations with his friends than Stepan Trofimovitch. Oh, I don't blame him. But this fastidiousness and irony which he preserved in spite of all shocks reassured me at the time. A man who was so little different from his ordinary self was, of course, not in the mood at that moment for anything tragic or extraordinary. So I reasoned at the time, and, heavens, what a mistake I made! I left too much out of my reckoning.

In anticipation of events I will quote the few first lines of the letter to Darya Pavlovna, which she actually received the following day:

""Mon enfant, my hand trembles, but I've done with everything. You were not present at my last struggle: you did not come to that matinée, and you did well to stay away. But you will be told that in our Russia, which has grown so poor in men of character, one man had the courage to stand up and, in spite of deadly menaces showered on him from all sides, to tell the fools the truth, that is, that they are fools. Oh, ce sont—des pauvres petits vauriens et rien de plus, des petits—fools—voilà le mot! The die is cast; I am going from this town for ever and I know not whither. Every one I loved has turned from me. But you, you are a pure and naïve creature; you, a gentle being whose life has been all but linked with mine at the will of a capricious and imperious heart; you who looked at me perhaps with contempt when I shed weak tears on the eve of our frustrated marriage; you, who cannot in any case look on me except as a comic figure—for you, for you is the last cry of my heart, for you my last duty, for you alone! I cannot leave you for ever thinking of me as an ungrateful fool, a churlish egoist, as probably a cruel and ungrateful heart—whom, alas, I cannot forget—is every day describing me to you....""

And so on and so on, four large pages.

Answering his ""I won't open"" with three bangs with my fist on the door, and shouting after him that I was sure he would send Nastasya for me three times that day, but I would not come, I gave him up and ran off to Yulia Mihailovna.

                                                            II

There I was the witness of a revolting scene: the poor woman was deceived to her face, and I could do nothing. Indeed, what could I say to her? I had had time to reconsider things a little and reflect that I had nothing to go upon but certain feelings and suspicious presentiments. I found her in tears, almost in hysterics, with compresses of eau-de-Cologne and a glass of water. Before her stood Pyotr Stepanovitch, who talked without stopping, and the prince, who held his tongue as though it had been under a lock. With tears and lamentations she reproached Pyotr Stepanovitch for his ""desertion."" I was struck at once by the fact that she ascribed the whole failure, the whole ignominy of the matinée, everything in fact, to Pyotr Stepanovitch's absence.

In him I observed an important change: he seemed a shade too anxious, almost serious. As a rule he never seemed serious; he was always laughing, even when he was angry, and he was often angry. Oh, he was angry now! He was speaking coarsely, carelessly, with vexation and impatience. He said that he had been taken ill at Gaganov's lodging, where he had happened to go early in the morning. Alas, the poor woman was so anxious to be deceived again! The chief question which I found being discussed was whether the ball, that is, the whole second half of the fête, should or should not take place. Yulia Mihailovna could not be induced to appear at the ball ""after the insults she had received that morning""; in other words, her heart was set on being compelled to do so, and by him, by Pyotr Stepanovitch. She looked upon him as an oracle, and I believe if he had gone away she would have taken to her bed at once. But he did not want to go away; he was desperately anxious that the ball should take place and that Yulia Mihailovna should be present at it.

""Come, what is there to cry about? Are you set on having a scene? On venting your anger on somebody? Well, vent it on me; only make haste about it, for the time is passing and you must make up your mind. We made a mess of it with the matinée; we'll pick up on the ball. Here, the prince thinks as I do. Yes, if it hadn't been for the prince, how would things have ended there?""

The prince had been at first opposed to the ball (that is, opposed to Yulia Mihailovna's appearing at it; the ball was bound to go on in any case), but after two or three such references to his opinion he began little by little to grunt his acquiescence.

I was surprised too at the extraordinary rudeness of Pyotr Stepanovitch's tone. Oh, I scout with indignation the contemptible slander which was spread later of some supposed liaison between Yulia Mihailovna and Pyotr Stepanovitch. There was no such thing, nor could there be. He gained his ascendency over her from the first only by encouraging her in her dreams of influence in society and in the ministry, by entering into her plans, by inventing them for her, and working upon her with the grossest flattery. He had got her completely into his toils and had become as necessary to her as the air she breathed. Seeing me, she cried, with flashing eyes:

""Here, ask him. He kept by my side all the while, just like the prince did. Tell me, isn't it plain that it was all a preconcerted plot, a base, designing plot to damage Andrey Antonovitch and me as much as possible? Oh, they had arranged it beforehand. They had a plan! It's a party, a regular party.""

""You are exaggerating as usual. You've always some romantic notion in your head. But I am glad to see Mr...."" (He pretended to have forgotten my name.) ""He'll give us his opinion.""

""My opinion,"" I hastened to put in, ""is the same as Yulia Mihailovna's. The plot is only too evident. I have brought you these ribbons, Yulia Mihailovna. Whether the ball is to take place or not is not my business, for it's not in my power to decide; but my part as steward is over. Forgive my warmth, but I can't act against the dictates of common sense and my own convictions.""

""You hear! You hear!"" She clasped her hands.

""I hear, and I tell you this."" He turned to me. ""I think you must have eaten something which has made you all delirious. To my thinking, nothing has happened, absolutely nothing but what has happened before and is always liable to happen in this town. A plot, indeed! It was an ugly failure, disgracefully stupid. But where's the plot? A plot against Yulia Mihailovna, who has spoiled them and protected them and fondly forgiven them all their schoolboy pranks! Yulia Mihailovna! What have I been hammering into you for the last month continually? What did I warn you? What did you want with all these people—what did you want with them? What induced you to mix yourself up with these fellows? What was the motive, what was the object of it? To unite society? But, mercy on us! will they ever be united?""

""When did you warn me? On the contrary, you approved of it, you even insisted on it.... I confess I am so surprised.... You brought all sorts of strange people to see me yourself.""

""On the contrary, I opposed you; I did not approve of it. As for bringing them to see you, I certainly did, but only after they'd got in by dozens and only of late to make up 'the literary quadrille'—we couldn't get on without these rogues. Only I don't mind betting that a dozen or two more of the same sort were let in without tickets to-day.""

""Not a doubt of it,"" I agreed.

""There, you see, you are agreeing already. Think what the tone has been lately here—I mean in this wretched town. It's nothing but insolence, impudence; it's been a crying scandal all the time. And who's been encouraging it? Who's screened it by her authority? Who's upset them all? Who has made all the small fry huffy? All their family secrets are caricatured in your album. Didn't you pat them on the back, your poets and caricaturists? Didn't you let Lyamshin kiss your hand? Didn't a divinity student abuse an actual state councillor in your presence and spoil his daughter's dress with his tarred boots? Now, can you wonder that the public is set against you?""

""But that's all your doing, yours! Oh, my goodness!""

""No, I warned you. We quarrelled. Do you hear, we quarrelled?""

""Why, you are lying to my face!""

""Of course it's easy for you to say that. You need a victim to vent your wrath on. Well, vent it on me as I've said already. I'd better appeal to you, Mr...."" (He was still unable to recall my name.) ""We'll reckon on our fingers. I maintain that, apart from Liputin, there was nothing preconcerted, nothing! I will prove it, but first let us analyse Liputin. He came forward with that fool Lebyadkin's verses. Do you maintain that that was a plot? But do you know it might simply have struck Liputin as a clever thing to do. Seriously, seriously. He simply came forward with the idea of making every one laugh and entertaining them—his protectress Yulia Mihailovna first of all. That was all. Don't you believe it? Isn't that in keeping with all that has been going on here for the last month? Do you want me to tell the whole truth? I declare that under other circumstances it might have gone off all right. It was a coarse joke—well, a bit strong, perhaps; but it was amusing, you know, wasn't it?""

""What! You think what Liputin did was clever?"" Yulia Mihailovna cried in intense indignation. ""Such stupidity, such tactlessness, so contemptible, so mean! It was intentional! Oh, you are saying it on purpose! I believe after that you are in the plot with them yourself.""

""Of course I was behind the scenes, I was in hiding, I set it all going. But if I were in the plot—understand that, anyway—it wouldn't have ended with Liputin. So according to you I had arranged with my papa too that he should cause such a scene on purpose? Well, whose fault is it that my papa was allowed to read? Who tried only yesterday to prevent you from allowing it, only yesterday?""

""Oh, hier il avait tant d'esprit, I was so reckoning on him; and then he has such manners. I thought with him and Karmazinov... Only think!

""Yes, only think. But in spite of tant d'esprit papa has made things worse, and if I'd known beforehand that he'd make such a mess of it, I should certainly not have persuaded you yesterday to keep the goat out of the kitchen garden, should I—since I am taking part in this conspiracy against your fête that you are so positive about? And yet I did try to dissuade you yesterday; I tried to because I foresaw it. To foresee everything was, of course, impossible; he probably did not know himself a minute before what he would fire off—these nervous old men can't be reckoned on like other people. But you can still save the situation: to satisfy the public, send to him to-morrow by administrative order, and with all the ceremonies, two doctors to inquire into his health. Even to-day, in fact, and take him straight to the hospital and apply cold compresses. Every one would laugh, anyway, and see that there was nothing to take offence at. I'll tell people about it in the evening at the ball, as I am his son. Karmazinov is another story. He was a perfect ass and dragged out his article for a whole hour. He certainly must have been in the plot with me! 'I'll make a mess of it too,' he thought, 'to damage Yulia Mihailovna.'""

""Oh, Karmazinov! Quelle honte! I was burning, burning with shame for his audience!""

""Well, I shouldn't have burnt, but have cooked him instead. The audience was right, you know. Who was to blame for Karmazinov, again? Did I foist him upon you? Was I one of his worshippers? Well, hang him! But the third maniac, the political—that's a different matter. That was every one's blunder, not only my plot.""

""Ah, don't speak of it! That was awful, awful! That was my fault, entirely my fault!""

""Of course it was, but I don't blame you for that. No one can control them, these candid souls! You can't always be safe from them, even in Petersburg. He was recommended to you, and in what terms too! So you will admit that you are bound to appear at the ball to-night. It's an important business. It was you put him on to the platform. You must make it plain now to the public that you are not in league with him, that the fellow is in the hands of the police, and that you were in some inexplicable way deceived. You ought to declare with indignation that you were the victim of a madman. Because he is a madman and nothing more. That's how you must put it about him. I can't endure these people who bite. I say worse things perhaps, but not from the platform, you know. And they are talking about a senator too.""

""What senator? Who's talking?""

""I don't understand it myself, you know. Do you know anything about a senator, Yulia Mihailovna?""

""A senator?""

""You see, they are convinced that a senator has been appointed to be governor here, and that you are being superseded from Petersburg. I've heard it from lots of people.""

""I've heard it too,"" I put in.

""Who said so?"" asked Yulia Mihailovna, flushing all over.

""You mean, who said so first? How can I tell? But there it is, people say so. Masses of people are saying so. They were saying so yesterday particularly. They are all very serious about it, though I can't make it out. Of course the more intelligent and competent don't talk, but even some of those listen.""

""How mean! And... how stupid!""

""Well, that's just why you must make your appearance, to show these fools.""

""I confess I feel myself that it's my duty, but... what if there's another disgrace in store for us? What if people don't come? No one will come, you know, no one!""

""How hot you are! They not come! What about the new clothes? What about the girls' dresses? I give you up as a woman after that! Is that your knowledge of human nature?""

""The marshal's wife won't come, she won't.""

""But, after all, what has happened? Why won't they come?"" he cried at last with angry impatience.

""Ignominy, disgrace—that's what's happened. I don't know what to call it, but after it I can't face people.""

""Why? How are you to blame for it, after all? Why do you take the blame of it on yourself? Isn't it rather the fault of the audience, of your respectable residents, your patresfamilias? They ought to have controlled the roughs and the rowdies—for it was all the work of roughs and rowdies, nothing serious. You can never manage things with the police alone in any society, anywhere. Among us every one asks for a special policeman to protect him wherever he goes. People don't understand that society must protect itself. And what do our patresfamilias, the officials, the wives and daughters, do in such cases? They sit quiet and sulk. In fact there's not enough social initiative to keep the disorderly in check.""

""Ah, that's the simple truth! They sit quiet, sulk and... gaze about them.""

""And if it's the truth, you ought to say so aloud, proudly, sternly, just to show that you are not defeated, to those respectable residents and mothers of families. Oh, you can do it; you have the gift when your head is clear. You will gather them round you and say it aloud. And then a paragraph in the Voice and the Financial News. Wait a bit, I'll undertake it myself, I'll arrange it all for you. Of course there must be more superintendence: you must look after the buffet; you must ask the prince, you must ask Mr.... You must not desert us, monsieur, just when we have to begin all over again. And finally, you must appear arm-in-arm with Andrey Antonovitch.... How is Andrey Antonovitch?""

""Oh, how unjustly, how untruly, how cruelly you have always judged that angelic man!"" Yulia Mihailovna cried in a sudden, outburst, almost with tears, putting her handkerchief to her eyes.

Pyotr Stepanovitch was positively taken aback for the moment. ""Good heavens! I.... What have I said? I've always...""

""You never have, never! You have never done him justice.""

""There's no understanding a woman,"" grumbled Pyotr Stepanovitch, with a wry smile.

""He is the most sincere, the most delicate, the most angelic of men! The most kind-hearted of men!""

""Well, really, as for kind-heartedness... I've always done him justice....""

""Never! But let us drop it. I am too awkward in my defence of him. This morning that little Jesuit, the marshal's wife, also dropped some sarcastic hints about what happened yesterday.""

""Oh, she has no thoughts to spare for yesterday now, she is full of to-day. And why are you so upset at her not coming to the ball to-night? Of course, she won't come after getting mixed up in such a scandal. Perhaps it's not her fault, but still her reputation... her hands are soiled.""

""What do you mean; I don't understand? Why are her hands soiled?"" Yulia Mihailovna looked at him in perplexity.

""I don't vouch for the truth of it, but the town is ringing with the story that it was she brought them together.""

""What do you mean? Brought whom together?""

""What, do you mean to say you don't know?"" he exclaimed with well-simulated wonder. ""Why Stavrogin and Lizaveta Nikolaevna.""

""What? How?"" we all cried out at once.

""Is it possible you don't know? Phew! Why, it is quite a tragic romance: Lizaveta Nikolaevna was pleased to get out of that lady's carriage and get straight into Stavrogin's carriage, and slipped off with 'the latter' to Skvoreshniki in full daylight. Only an hour ago, hardly an hour.""

We were flabbergasted. Of course we fell to questioning him, but to our wonder, although he ""happened"" to be a witness of the scene himself, he could give us no detailed account of it. The thing seemed to have happened like this: when the marshal's wife was driving Liza and Mavriky Nikolaevitch from the matinée to the house of Praskovya Ivanovna (whose legs were still bad) they saw a carriage waiting a short distance, about twenty-five paces, to one side of the front door. When Liza jumped out, she ran straight to this carriage; the door was flung open and shut again; Liza called to Mavriky Nikolaevitch, ""Spare me,"" and the carriage drove off at full speed to Skvoreshniki. To our hurried questions whether it was by arrangement? Who was in the carriage? Pyotr Stepanovitch answered that he knew nothing about it; no doubt it had been arranged, but that he did not see Stavrogin himself; possibly the old butler, Alexey Yegorytch, might have been in the carriage. To the question ""How did he come to be there, and how did he know for a fact that she had driven to Skvoreshniki?"" he answered that he happened to be passing and, at seeing Liza, he had run up to the carriage (and yet he could not make out who was in it, an inquisitive man like him!) and that Mavriky Nikolaevitch, far from setting off in pursuit, had not even tried to stop Liza, and had even laid a restraining hand on the marshal's wife, who was shouting at the top of her voice: ""She is going to Stavrogin, to Stavrogin."" At this point I lost patience, and cried furiously to Pyotr Stepanovitch:

""It's all your doing, you rascal! This was what you were doing this morning. You helped Stavrogin, you came in the carriage, you helped her into it... it was you, you, you! Yulia Mihailovna, he is your enemy; he will be your ruin too! Beware of him!""

And I ran headlong out of the house. I wonder myself and cannot make out to this day how I came to say that to him. But I guessed quite right: it had all happened almost exactly as I said, as appeared later. What struck me most was the obviously artificial way in which he broke the news. He had not told it at once on entering the house as an extraordinary piece of news, but pretended that we knew without his telling us which was impossible in so short a time. And if we had known it, we could not possibly have refrained from mentioning it till he introduced the subject. Besides, he could not have heard yet that the town was ""ringing with gossip"" about the marshal's wife in so short a time. Besides, he had once or twice given a vulgar, frivolous smile as he told the story, probably considering that we were fools and completely taken in.

But I had no thought to spare for him; the central fact I believed, and ran from Yulia Mihailovna's, beside myself. The catastrophe cut me to the heart. I was wounded almost to tears; perhaps I did shed some indeed. I was at a complete loss what to do. I rushed to Stepan Trofimovitch's, but the vexatious man still refused to open the door. Nastasya informed me, in a reverent whisper, that he had gone to bed, but I did not believe it. At Liza's house I succeeded in questioning the servants. They confirmed the story of the elopement, but knew nothing themselves. There was great commotion in the house; their mistress had been attacked by fainting fits, and Mavriky Nikolaevitch was with her. I did not feel it possible to ask for Mavriky Nikolaevitch. To my inquiries about Pyotr Stepanovitch they told me that he had been in and out continually of late, sometimes twice in the day. The servants were sad, and showed particular respectfulness in speaking of Liza; they were fond of her. That she was ruined, utterly ruined, I did not doubt; but the psychological aspect of the matter I was utterly unable to understand, especially after her scene with Stavrogin the previous day. To run about the town and inquire at the houses of acquaintances, who would, of course, by now have heard the news and be rejoicing at it, seemed to me revolting, besides being humiliating for Liza. But, strange to say, I ran to see Darya Pavlovna, though I was not admitted (no one had been admitted into the house since the previous morning). I don't know what I could have said to her and what made me run to her. From her I went to her brother's. Shatov listened sullenly and in silence. I may observe that I found him more gloomy than I had ever seen him before; he was awfully preoccupied and seemed only to listen to me with an effort. He said scarcely anything and began walking up and down his cell from corner to corner, treading more noisily than usual. As I was going down the stairs he shouted after me to go to Liputin's: ""There you'll hear everything."" Yet I did not go to Liputin's, but after I'd gone a good way towards home I turned back to Shatov's again, and, half opening the door without going in, suggested to him laconically and with no kind of explanation, ""Won't you go to Marya Timofyevna to-day?"" At this Shatov swore at me, and I went away. I note here that I may not forget it that he did purposely go that evening to the other end of the town to see Marya Timofyevna, whom he had not seen for some time. He found her in excellent health and spirits and Lebyadkin dead drunk, asleep on the sofa in the first room. This was at nine o'clock. He told me so himself next day when we met for a moment in the street. Before ten o'clock I made up my mind to go to the ball, but not in the capacity of a steward (besides my rosette had been left at Yulia Mihailovna's). I was tempted by irresistible curiosity to listen, without asking any questions, to what people were saying in the town about all that had happened. I wanted, too, to have a look at Yulia Mihailovna, if only at a distance. I reproached myself greatly that I had left her so abruptly that afternoon.

                                                            III

All that night, with its almost grotesque incidents, and the terrible dénouement that followed in the early morning, still seems to me like a hideous nightmare, and is, for me at least, the most painful chapter in my chronicle. I was late for the ball, and it was destined to end so quickly that I arrived not long before it was over. It was eleven o'clock when I reached the entrance of the marshal's house, where the same White Hall in which the matinée had taken place had, in spite of the short interval between, been cleared and made ready to serve as the chief ballroom for the whole town, as we expected, to dance in. But far as I had been that morning from expecting the ball to be a success, I had had no presentiment of the full truth. Not one family of the higher circles appeared; even the subordinate officials of rather more consequence were absent—and this was a very striking fact. As for ladies and girls, Pyotr Stepanovitch's arguments (the duplicity of which was obvious now) turned out to be utterly incorrect: exceedingly few had come; to four men there was scarcely one lady—and what ladies they were! Regimental ladies of a sort, three doctors' wives with their daughters, two or three poor ladies from the country, the seven daughters and the niece of the secretary whom I have mentioned already, some wives of tradesmen, of post-office clerks and other small fry—was this what Yulia Mihailovna expected? Half the tradespeople even were absent. As for the men, in spite of the complete absence of all persons of consequence, there was still a crowd of them, but they made a doubtful and suspicious impression. There were, of course, some quiet and respectful officers with their wives, some of the most docile fathers of families, like that secretary, for instance, the father of his seven daughters. All these humble, insignificant people had come, as one of these gentlemen expressed it, because it was ""inevitable."" But, on the other hand, the mass of free-and-easy people and the mass too of those whom Pyotr Stepanovitch and I had suspected of coming in without tickets, seemed even bigger than in the afternoon. So far they were all sitting in the refreshment bar, and had gone straight there on arriving, as though it were the meeting-place they had agreed upon. So at least it seemed to me. The refreshment bar had been placed in a large room, the last of several opening out of one another. Here Prohoritch was installed with all the attractions of the club cuisine and with a tempting display of drinks and dainties. I noticed several persons whose coats were almost in rags and whose get-up was altogether suspicious and utterly unsuitable for a ball. They had evidently been with great pains brought to a state of partial sobriety which would not last long; and goodness knows where they had been brought from, they were not local people. I knew, of course, that it was part of Yulia Mihailovna's idea that the ball should be of the most democratic character, and that ""even working people and shopmen should not be excluded if any one of that class chanced to pay for a ticket."" She could bravely utter such words in her committee with absolute security that none of the working people of our town, who all lived in extreme poverty, would dream of taking a ticket. But in spite of the democratic sentiments of the committee, I could hardly believe that such sinister-looking and shabby people could have been admitted in the regular way. But who could have admitted them, and with what object? Lyamshin and Liputin had already been deprived of their steward's rosettes, though they were present at the ball, as they were taking part in the ""literary quadrille."" But, to my amazement, Liputin's place was taken by the divinity student, who had caused the greatest scandal at the matinée by his skirmish with Stepan Trofimovitch; and Lyamshin's was taken by Pyotr Stepanovitch himself. What was to be looked for under the circumstances?

I tried to listen to the conversation. I was struck by the wildness of some ideas I heard expressed. It was maintained in one group, for instance, that Yulia Mihailovna had arranged Liza's elopement with Stavrogin and had been paid by the latter for doing so. Even the sum paid was mentioned. It was asserted that she had arranged the whole fête with a view to it, and that that was the reason why half the town had not turned up at the ball, and that Lembke himself was so upset about it that ""his mind had given way,"" and that, crazy as he was, ""she had got him in tow."" There was a great deal of laughter too, hoarse, wild and significant. Every one was criticising the ball, too, with great severity, and abusing Yulia Mihailovna without ceremony. In fact it was disorderly, incoherent, drunken and excited babble, so it was difficult to put it together and make anything of it. At the same time there were simple-hearted people enjoying themselves at the refreshment-bar; there were even some ladies of the sort who are surprised and frightened at nothing, very genial and festive, chiefly military ladies with their husbands. They made parties at the little tables, were drinking tea, and were very merry. The refreshment-bar made a snug refuge for almost half of the guests. Yet in a little time all this mass of people must stream into the ballroom. It was horrible to think of it!

Meanwhile the prince had succeeded in arranging three skimpy quadrilles in the White Hall. The young ladies were dancing, while their parents were enjoying watching them. But many of these respectable persons had already begun to think how they could, after giving their girls a treat, get off in good time before ""the trouble began."" Absolutely every one was convinced that it certainly would begin. It would be difficult for me to describe Yulia Mihailovna's state of mind. I did not talk to her though I went close up to her. She did not respond to the bow I made her on entering; she did not notice me (really did not notice). There was a painful look in her face and a contemptuous and haughty though restless and agitated expression in her eyes. She controlled herself with evident suffering—for whose sake, with what object? She certainly ought to have gone away, still more to have got her husband away, and she remained! From her face one could see that her eyes were ""fully opened,"" and that it was useless for her to expect any thing more. She did not even summon Pyotr Stepanovitch (he seemed to avoid her; I saw him in the refreshment-room, he was extremely lively). But she remained at the ball and did not let Andrey Antonovitch leave her side for a moment. Oh, up to the very last moment, even that morning she would have repudiated any hint about his health with genuine indignation. But now her eyes were to be opened on this subject too. As for me, I thought from the first glance that Andrey Antonovitch looked worse than he had done in the morning. He seemed to be plunged into a sort of oblivion and hardly to know where he was. Sometimes he looked about him with unexpected severity—at me, for instance, twice. Once he tried to say something; he began loudly and audibly but did not finish the sentence, throwing a modest old clerk who happened to be near him almost into a panic. But even this humble section of the assembly held sullenly and timidly aloof from Yulia Mihailovna and at the same time turned upon her husband exceedingly strange glances, open and staring, quite out of keeping with their habitually submissive demeanour.

""Yes, that struck me, and I suddenly began to guess about Andrey Antonovitch,"" Yulia Mihailovna confessed to me afterwards.

Yes, she was to blame again! Probably when after my departure she had settled with Pyotr Stepanovitch that there should be a ball and that she should be present she must have gone again to the study where Andrey Antonovitch was sitting, utterly ""shattered"" by the matinée; must again have used all her fascinations to persuade him to come with her. But what misery she must have been in now! And yet she did not go away. Whether it was pride or simply she lost her head, I do not know. In spite of her haughtiness, she attempted with smiles and humiliation to enter into conversation with some ladies, but they were confused, confined themselves to distrustful monosyllables, ""Yes"" and ""No,"" and evidently avoided her.

The only person of undoubted consequence who was present at the ball was that distinguished general whom I have described already, the one who after Stavrogin's duel with Gaganov opened the door to public impatience at the marshal's wife's. He walked with an air of dignity through the rooms, looked about, and listened, and tried to appear as though he had come rather for the sake of observation than for the sake of enjoying himself.... He ended by establishing himself beside Yulia Mihailovna and not moving a step away from her, evidently trying to keep up her spirits, and reassure her. He certainly was a most kind-hearted man, of very high rank, and so old that even compassion from him was not wounding. But to admit to herself that this old gossip was venturing to pity her and almost to protect her, knowing that he was doing her honour by his presence, was very vexatious. The general stayed by her and never ceased chattering.

""They say a town can't go on without seven righteous men... seven, I think it is, I am not sure of the number fixed.... I don't know how many of these seven, the certified righteous of the town... have the honour of being present at your ball. Yet in spite of their presence I begin to feel unsafe. Vous me pardonnez, charmante dame, n'est-ce pas? I speak allegorically, but I went into the refreshment-room and I am glad I escaped alive.... Our priceless Prohoritch is not in his place there, and I believe his bar will be destroyed before morning. But I am laughing. I am only waiting to see what the 'literary quadrille' is going to be like, and then home to bed. You must excuse a gouty old fellow. I go early to bed, and I would advise you too to go 'by-by,' as they say aux enfants. I've come, you know, to have a look at the pretty girls... whom, of course, I could meet nowhere in such profusion as here. They all live beyond the river and I don't drive out so far. There's a wife of an officer... in the chasseurs I believe he is... who is distinctly pretty, distinctly, and... she knows it herself. I've talked to the sly puss; she is a sprightly one... and the girls too are fresh-looking; but that's all, there's nothing but freshness. Still, it's a pleasure to look at them. There are some rosebuds, but their lips are thick. As a rule there's an irregularity about female beauty in Russia, and... they are a little like buns.... vous me pardonnez, n'est-ce pas?... with good eyes, however, laughing eyes.... These rose buds are charming for two years when they are young... even for three... then they broaden out and are spoilt for ever... producing in their husbands that deplorable indifference which does so much to promote the woman movement... that is, if I understand it correctly.... H'm! It's a fine hall; the rooms are not badly decorated. It might be worse. The music might be much worse.... I don't say it ought to have been. What makes a bad impression is that there are so few ladies. I say nothing about the dresses. It's bad that that chap in the grey trousers should dare to dance the cancan so openly. I can forgive him if he does it in the gaiety of his heart, and since he is the local chemist.... Still, eleven o'clock is a bit early even for chemists. There were two fellows fighting in the refreshment-bar and they weren't turned out. At eleven o'clock people ought to be turned out for fighting, whatever the standard of manners.... Three o'clock is a different matter; then one has to make concessions to public opinion—if only this ball survives till three o'clock. Varvara Petrovna has not kept her word, though, and hasn't sent flowers. H'm! She has no thoughts for flowers, pauvre mère! And poor Liza! Have you heard? They say it's a mysterious story... and Stavrogin is to the front again.... H'm! I would have gone home to bed... I can hardly keep my eyes open. But when is this 'literary quadrille' coming on?""

At last the ""literary quadrille"" began. Whenever of late there had been conversation in the town on the ball it had invariably turned on this literary quadrille, and as no one could imagine what it would be like, it aroused extraordinary curiosity. Nothing could be more unfavourable to its chance of success, and great was the disappointment.

The side doors of the White Hall were thrown open and several masked figures appeared. The public surrounded them eagerly. All the occupants of the refreshment-bar trooped to the last man into the hall. The masked figures took their places for the dance. I succeeded in making my way to the front and installed myself just behind Yulia Mihailovna, Von Lembke, and the general. At this point Pyotr Stepanovitch, who had kept away till that time, skipped up to Yulia Mihailovna.

""I've been in the refreshment-room all this time, watching,"" he whispered, with the air of a guilty schoolboy, which he, however, assumed on purpose to irritate her even more. She turned crimson with anger.

""You might give up trying to deceive me now at least, insolent man!"" broke from her almost aloud, so that it was heard by other people. Pyotr Stepanovitch skipped away extremely well satisfied with himself.

It would be difficult to imagine a more pitiful, vulgar, dull and insipid allegory than this ""literary quadrille."" Nothing could be imagined less appropriate to our local society. Yet they say it was Karmazinov's idea. It was Liputin indeed who arranged it with the help of the lame teacher who had been at the meeting at Virginsky's. But Karmazinov had given the idea and had, it was said, meant to dress up and to take a special and prominent part in it. The quadrille was made up of six couples of masked figures, who were not in fancy dress exactly, for their clothes were like every one else's. Thus, for instance, one short and elderly gentleman wearing a dress-coat—in fact, dressed like every one else—wore a venerable grey beard, tied on (and this constituted his disguise). As he danced he pounded up and down, taking tiny and rapid steps on the same spot with a stolid expression of countenance. He gave vent to sounds in a subdued but husky bass, and this huskiness was meant to suggest one of the well-known papers. Opposite this figure danced two giants, X and Z, and these letters were pinned on their coats, but what the letters meant remained unexplained. ""Honest Russian thought"" was represented by a middle-aged gentleman in spectacles, dress-coat and gloves, and wearing fetters (real fetters). Under his arm he had a portfolio containing papers relating to some ""case."" To convince the sceptical, a letter from abroad testifying to the honesty of ""honest Russian thought"" peeped out of his pocket. All this was explained by the stewards, as the letter which peeped out of his pocket could not be read. ""Honest Russian thought"" had his right hand raised and in it held a glass as though he wanted to propose a toast. In a line with him on each side tripped a crop-headed Nihilist girl; while vis-à-vis danced another elderly gentleman in a dress-coat with a heavy cudgel in his hand. He was meant to represent a formidable periodical (not a Petersburg one), and seemed to be saying, ""I'll pound you to a jelly."" But in spite of his cudgel he could not bear the spectacles of ""honest Russian thought"" fixed upon him and tried to look away, and when he did the pas de deux, he twisted, turned, and did not know what to do with himself—so terrible, probably, were the stings of his conscience! I don't remember all the absurd tricks they played, however; it was all in the same style, so that I felt at last painfully ashamed. And this same expression, as it were, of shame was reflected in the whole public, even on the most sullen figures that had come out of the refreshment-room. For some time all were silent and gazed with angry perplexity. When a man is ashamed he generally begins to get angry and is disposed to be cynical. By degrees a murmur arose in the audience.

""What's the meaning of it?"" a man who had come in from the refreshment-room muttered in one of the groups.

""It's silly.""

""It's something literary. It's a criticism of the Voice.""

""What's that to me?""

From another group:

""Asses!""

""No, they are not asses; it's we who are the asses.""

""Why are you an ass?""

""I am not an ass.""

""Well, if you are not, I am certainly not.""

From a third group:

""We ought to give them a good smacking and send them flying.""

""Pull down the hall!""

From a fourth group:

""I wonder the Lembkes are not ashamed to look on!""

""Why should they be ashamed? You are not.""

""Yes, I am ashamed, and he is the governor.""

""And you are a pig.""

""I've never seen such a commonplace ball in my life,"" a lady observed viciously, quite close to Yulia Mihailovna, obviously with the intention of being overheard. She was a stout lady of forty with rouge on her cheeks, wearing a bright-coloured silk dress. Almost every one in the town knew her, but no one received her. She was the widow of a civil councillor, who had left her a wooden house and a small pension; but she lived well and kept horses. Two months previously she had called on Yulia Mihailovna, but the latter had not received her.

""That might have been foreseen,"" she added, looking insolently into Yulia Mihailovna's face.

""If you could foresee it, why did you come?"" Yulia Mihailovna could not resist saying.

""Because I was too simple,"" the sprightly lady answered instantly, up in arms and eager for the fray; but the general intervened.

""Chère dame""—he bent over to Yulia Mihailovna—""you'd really better be going. We are only in their way and they'll enjoy themselves thoroughly without us. You've done your part, you've opened the ball, now leave them in peace. And Andrey Antonovitch doesn't seem to be feeling quite satisfactorily.... To avoid trouble.""

But it was too late.

All through the quadrille Andrey Antonovitch gazed at the dancers with a sort of angry perplexity, and when he heard the comments of the audience he began looking about him uneasily. Then for the first time he caught sight of some of the persons who had come from the refreshment-room; there was an expression of extreme wonder in his face. Suddenly there was a loud roar of laughter at a caper that was cut in the quadrille. The editor of the ""menacing periodical, not a Petersburg one,"" who was dancing with the cudgel in his hands, felt utterly unable to endure the spectacled gaze of ""honest Russian thought,"" and not knowing how to escape it, suddenly in the last figure advanced to meet him standing on his head, which was meant, by the way, to typify the continual turning upside down of common sense by the menacing non-Petersburg gazette. As Lyamshin was the only one who could walk standing on his head, he had undertaken to represent the editor with the cudgel. Yulia Mihailovna had had no idea that anyone was going to walk on his head. ""They concealed that from me, they concealed it,"" she repeated to me afterwards in despair and indignation. The laughter from the crowd was, of course, provoked not by the allegory, which interested no one, but simply by a man's walking on his head in a swallow-tail coat. Lembke flew into a rage and shook with fury.

""Rascal!"" he cried, pointing to Lyamshin, ""take hold of the scoundrel, turn him over... turn his legs... his head... so that his head's up... up!""

Lyamshin jumped on to his feet. The laughter grew louder.

""Turn out all the scoundrels who are laughing!"" Lembke prescribed suddenly.

There was an angry roar and laughter in the crowd.

""You can't do like that, your Excellency.""

""You mustn't abuse the public.""

""You are a fool yourself!"" a voice cried suddenly from a corner.

""Filibusters!"" shouted some one from the other end of the room.

Lembke looked round quickly at the shout and turned pale. A vacant smile came on to his lips, as though he suddenly understood and remembered something.

""Gentlemen,"" said Yulia Mihailovna, addressing the crowd which was pressing round them, as she drew her husband away—""gentlemen, excuse Andrey Antonovitch. Andrey Antonovitch is unwell... excuse... forgive him, gentlemen.""

I positively heard her say ""forgive him."" It all happened very quickly. But I remember for a fact that a section of the public rushed out of the hall immediately after those words of Yulia Mihailovna's as though panic-stricken. I remember one hysterical, tearful feminine shriek:

""Ach, the same thing again!""

And in the retreat of the guests, which was almost becoming a crush, another bomb exploded exactly as in the afternoon.

""Fire! All the riverside quarter is on fire!""

I don't remember where this terrible cry rose first, whether it was first raised in the hall, or whether some one ran upstairs from the entry, but it was followed by such alarm that I can't attempt to describe it. More than half the guests at the ball came from the quarter beyond the river, and were owners or occupiers of wooden houses in that district. They rushed to the windows, pulled back the curtains in a flash, and tore down the blinds. The riverside was in flames. The fire, it is true, was only beginning, but it was in flames in three separate places—and that was what was alarming.

""Arson! The Shpigulin men!"" roared the crowd.

I remember some very characteristic exclamations:

""I've had a presentiment in my heart that there'd be arson, I've had a presentiment of it these last few days!""

""The Shpigulin men, the Shpigulin men, no one else!""

""We were all lured here on purpose to set fire to it!""

This last most amazing exclamation came from a woman; it was an unintentional involuntary shriek of a housewife whose goods were burning. Every one rushed for the door. I won't describe the crush in the vestibule over sorting out cloaks, shawls, and pelisses, the shrieks of the frightened women, the weeping of the young ladies. I doubt whether there was any theft, but it was no wonder that in such disorder some went away without their wraps because they were unable to find them, and this grew into a legend with many additions, long preserved in the town. Lembke and Yulia Mihailovna were almost crushed by the crowd at the doors.

""Stop, every one! Don't let anyone out!"" yelled Lembke, stretching out his arms menacingly towards the crowding people.

""Every one without exception to be strictly searched at once!""

A storm of violent oaths rose from the crowd.

""Andrey Antonovitch! Andrey Antonovitch!"" cried Yulia Mihailovna in complete despair.

""Arrest her first!"" shouted her husband, pointing his finger at her threateningly. ""Search her first! The ball was arranged with a view to the fire....""

She screamed and fell into a swoon. (Oh, there was no doubt of its being a real one.) The general, the prince, and I rushed to her assistance; there were others, even among the ladies, who helped us at that difficult moment. We carried the unhappy woman out of this hell to her carriage, but she only regained consciousness as she reached the house, and her first utterance was about Andrey Antonovitch again. With the destruction of all her fancies, the only thing left in her mind was Andrey Antonovitch. They sent for a doctor. I remained with her for a whole hour; the prince did so too. The general, in an access of generous feeling (though he had been terribly scared), meant to remain all night ""by the bedside of the unhappy lady,"" but within ten minutes he fell asleep in an arm-chair in the drawing-room while waiting for the doctor, and there we left him.

The chief of the police, who had hurried from the ball to the fire, had succeeded in getting Andrey Antonovitch out of the hall after us, and attempted to put him into Yulia Mihailovna's carriage, trying all he could to persuade his Excellency ""to seek repose."" But I don't know why he did not insist. Andrey Antonovitch, of course, would not hear of repose, and was set on going to the fire; but that was not a sufficient reason. It ended in his taking him to the fire in his droshky. He told us afterwards that Lembke was gesticulating all the way and ""shouting orders that it was impossible to obey owing to their unusualness."" It was officially reported later on that his Excellency had at that time been in a delirious condition ""owing to a sudden fright.""

There is no need to describe how the ball ended. A few dozen rowdy fellows, and with them some ladies, remained in the hall. There were no police present. They would not let the orchestra go, and beat the musicians who attempted to leave. By morning they had pulled all Prohoritch's stall to pieces, had drunk themselves senseless, danced the Kamarinsky in its unexpurgated form, made the rooms in a shocking mess, and only towards daybreak part of this hopelessly drunken rabble reached the scene of the fire to make fresh disturbances there. The other part spent the night in the rooms dead drunk, with disastrous consequences to the velvet sofas and the floor. Next morning, at the earliest possibility, they were dragged out by their legs into the street. So ended the fête for the benefit of the governesses of our province.

                                                            IV

The fire frightened the inhabitants of the riverside just because it was evidently a case of arson. It was curious that at the first cry of ""fire"" another cry was raised that the Shpigulin men had done it. It is now well known that three Shpigulin men really did have a share in setting fire to the town, but that was all; all the other factory hands were completely acquitted, not only officially but also by public opinion. Besides those three rascals (of whom one has been caught and confessed and the other two have so far escaped), Fedka the convict undoubtedly had a hand in the arson. That is all that is known for certain about the fire till now; but when it comes to conjectures it's a very different matter. What had led these three rascals to do it? Had they been instigated by anyone? It is very difficult to answer all these questions even now.

Owing to the strong wind, the fact that the houses at the riverside were almost all wooden, and that they had been set fire to in three places, the fire spread quickly and enveloped the whole quarter with extraordinary rapidity. (The fire burnt, however, only at two ends; at the third spot it was extinguished almost as soon as it began to burn—of which later.) But the Petersburg and Moscow papers exaggerated our calamity. Not more than a quarter, roughly speaking, of the riverside district was burnt down; possibly less indeed. Our fire brigade, though it was hardly adequate to the size and population of the town, worked with great promptitude and devotion. But it would not have been of much avail, even with the zealous co-operation of the inhabitants, if the wind had not suddenly dropped towards morning. When an hour after our flight from the ball I made my way to the riverside, the fire was at its height. A whole street parallel with the river was in flames. It was as light as day. I won't describe the fire; every one in Russia knows what it looks like. The bustle and crush was immense in the lanes adjoining the burning street. The inhabitants, fully expecting the fire to reach their houses, were hauling out their belongings, but had not yet left their dwellings, and were waiting meanwhile sitting on their boxes and feather beds under their windows. Part of the male population were hard at work ruthlessly chopping down fences and even whole huts which were near the fire and on the windward side. None were crying except the children, who had been waked out of their sleep, though the women who had dragged out their chattels were lamenting in sing-song voices. Those who had not finished their task were still silent, busily carrying out their goods. Sparks and embers were carried a long way in all directions. People put them out as best they could. Some helped to put the fire out while others stood about, admiring it. A great fire at night always has a thrilling and exhilarating effect. This is what explains the attraction of fireworks. But in that case the artistic regularity with which the fire is presented and the complete lack of danger give an impression of lightness and playfulness like the effect of a glass of champagne. A real conflagration is a very different matter. Then the horror and a certain sense of personal danger, together with the exhilarating effect of a fire at night, produce on the spectator (though of course not in the householder whose goods are being burnt) a certain concussion of the brain and, as it were, a challenge to those destructive instincts which, alas, lie hidden in every heart, even that of the mildest and most domestic little clerk.... This sinister sensation is almost always fascinating. ""I really don't know whether one can look at a fire without a certain pleasure."" This is word for word what Stepan Trofimovitch said to me one night on returning home after he had happened to witness a fire and was still under the influence of the spectacle. Of course, the very man who enjoys the spectacle will rush into the fire himself to save a child or an old woman; but that is altogether a different matter.

Following in the wake of the crowd of sightseers, I succeeded, without asking questions, in reaching the chief centre of danger, where at last I saw Lembke, whom I was seeking at Yulia Mihailovna's request. His position was strange and extraordinary. He was standing on the ruins of a fence. Thirty paces to the left of him rose the black skeleton of a two-storied house which had almost burnt out. It had holes instead of windows at each story, its roof had fallen in, and the flames were still here and there creeping among the charred beams. At the farther end of the courtyard, twenty paces away, the lodge, also a two-storied building, was beginning to burn, and the firemen were doing their utmost to save it. On the right the firemen and the people were trying to save a rather large wooden building which was not actually burning, though it had caught fire several times and was inevitably bound to be burnt in the end. Lembke stood facing the lodge, shouting and gesticulating. He was giving orders which no one attempted to carry out. It seemed to me that every one had given him up as hopeless and left him. Anyway, though every one in the vast crowd of all classes, among whom there were gentlemen, and even the cathedral priest, was listening to him with curiosity and wonder, no one spoke to him or tried to get him away. Lembke, with a pale face and glittering eyes, was uttering the most amazing things. To complete the picture, he had lost his hat and was bareheaded.

""It's all incendiarism! It's nihilism! If anything is burning, it's nihilism!"" I heard almost with horror; and though there was nothing to be surprised at, yet actual madness, when one sees it, always gives one a shock.

""Your Excellency,"" said a policeman, coming up to him, ""what if you were to try the repose of home?... It's dangerous for your Excellency even to stand here.""

This policeman, as I heard afterwards, had been told off by the chief of police to watch over Andrey Antonovitch, to do his utmost to get him home, and in case of danger even to use force—a task evidently beyond the man's power.

""They will wipe away the tears of the people whose houses have been burnt, but they will burn down the town. It's all the work of four scoundrels, four and a half! Arrest the scoundrel! He worms himself into the honour of families. They made use of the governesses to burn down the houses. It's vile, vile! Aie, what's he about?"" he shouted, suddenly noticing a fireman at the top of the burning lodge, under whom the roof had almost burnt away and round whom the flames were beginning to flare up. ""Pull him down! Pull him down! He will fall, he will catch fire, put him out!... What is he doing there?""

""He is putting the fire out, your Excellency.""

""Not likely. The fire is in the minds of men and not in the roofs of houses. Pull him down and give it up! Better give it up, much better! Let it put itself out. Aie, who is crying now? An old woman! It's an old woman shouting. Why have they forgotten the old woman?""

There actually was an old woman crying on the ground floor of the burning lodge. She was an old creature of eighty, a relation of the shopkeeper who owned the house. But she had not been forgotten; she had gone back to the burning house while it was still possible, with the insane idea of rescuing her feather bed from a corner room which was still untouched. Choking with the smoke and screaming with the heat, for the room was on fire by the time she reached it, she was still trying with her decrepit hands to squeeze her feather bed through a broken window pane. Lembke rushed to her assistance. Every one saw him run up to the window, catch hold of one corner of the feather bed and try with all his might to pull it out. As ill luck would have it, a board fell at that moment from the roof and hit the unhappy governor. It did not kill him, it merely grazed him on the neck as it fell, but Andrey Antonovitch's career was over, among us at least; the blow knocked him off his feet and he sank on the ground unconscious.

The day dawned at last, gloomy and sullen. The fire was abating; the wind was followed by a sudden calm, and then a fine drizzling rain fell. I was by that time in another part, some distance from where Lembke had fallen, and here I overheard very strange conversations in the crowd. A strange fact had come to light. On the very outskirts of the quarter, on a piece of waste land beyond the kitchen gardens, not less than fifty paces from any other buildings, there stood a little wooden house which had only lately been built, and this solitary house had been on fire at the very beginning, almost before any other. Even had it burnt down, it was so far from other houses that no other building in the town could have caught fire from it, and, vice versa, if the whole riverside had been burnt to the ground, that house might have remained intact, whatever the wind had been. It followed that it had caught fire separately and independently and therefore not accidentally. But the chief point was that it was not burnt to the ground, and at daybreak strange things were discovered within it. The owner of this new house, who lived in the neighbourhood, rushed up as soon as he saw it in flames and with the help of his neighbours pulled apart a pile of faggots which had been heaped up by the side wall and set fire to. In this way he saved the house. But there were lodgers in the house—the captain, who was well known in the town, his sister, and their elderly servant, and these three persons—the captain, his sister, and their servant—had been murdered and apparently robbed in the night. (It was here that the chief of police had gone while Lembke was rescuing the feather bed.)

By morning the news had spread and an immense crowd of all classes, even the riverside people who had been burnt out had flocked to the waste land where the new house stood. It was difficult to get there, so dense was the crowd. I was told at once that the captain had been found lying dressed on the bench with his throat cut, and that he must have been dead drunk when he was killed, so that he had felt nothing, and he had ""bled like a bull""; that his sister Marya Timofeyevna had been ""stabbed all over"" with a knife and she was lying on the floor in the doorway, so that probably she had been awake and had fought and struggled with the murderer. The servant, who had also probably been awake, had her skull broken. The owner of the house said that the captain had come to see him the morning before, and that in his drunken bragging he had shown him a lot of money, as much as two hundred roubles. The captain's shabby old green pocket-book was found empty on the floor, but Marya Timofeyevna's box had not been touched, and the silver setting of the ikon had not been removed either; the captain's clothes, too, had not been disturbed. It was evident that the thief had been in a hurry and was a man familiar with the captain's circumstances, who had come only for money and knew where it was kept. If the owner of the house had not run up at that moment the burning faggot stack would certainly have set fire to the house and ""it would have been difficult to find out from the charred corpses how they had died.""

So the story was told. One other fact was added: that the person who had taken this house for the Lebyadkins was no other than Mr. Stavrogin, Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch, the son of Varvara Petrovna. He had come himself to take it and had had much ado to persuade the owner to let it, as the latter had intended to use it as a tavern; but Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch was ready to give any rent he asked and had paid for six months in advance.

""The fire wasn't an accident,"" I heard said in the crowd.

But the majority said nothing. People's faces were sullen, but I did not see signs of much indignation. People persisted, however, in gossiping about Stavrogin, saying that the murdered woman was his wife; that on the previous day he had ""dishonourably"" abducted a young lady belonging to the best family in the place, the daughter of Madame Drozdov, and that a complaint was to be lodged against him in Petersburg; and that his wife had been murdered evidently that he might marry the young lady. Skvoreshniki was not more than a mile and a half away, and I remember I wondered whether I should not let them know the position of affairs. I did not notice, however, that there was anyone egging the crowd on and I don't want to accuse people falsely, though I did see and recognised at once in the crowd at the fire two or three of the rowdy lot I had seen in the refreshment-room. I particularly remember one thin, tall fellow, a cabinet-maker, as I found out later, with an emaciated face and a curly head, black as though grimed with soot. He was not drunk, but in contrast to the gloomy passivity of the crowd seemed beside himself with excitement. He kept addressing the people, though I don't remember his words; nothing coherent that he said was longer than ""I say, lads, what do you say to this? Are things to go on like this?"" and so saying he waved his arms.",Fyodor Dostoevsky,1996,"[47, 45, 40, 41, 28, 29, 25, 27, 23, 18, 15, 15, 11, 10, 6, 7, 6, 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 36]",33

And ""This Pussy Belongs To Me""
Let's hear it for Mister...

[VERSE 1]
Now I know it's (a like that fearin'???)
But you still want to hear that Unholy spirit
Still getting done by none
Pulled up a dress and fucked a nun
The walls sweat blood from thinking about sex
As your clit gets wet
You're hot like fire, you desire
More than pleasure, much more higher
Your nipples on your chest start to bleed
The soup is getting hot, time to feed
Your Heaven is burning
As you're masturbating, but still you're yearning
The fire is getting very hot
As you stick your finger in the soup inside the pot
You begin to stir it
Lick your finger to taste it, but it's not done yet
A snow white virgin
Operating on yourself like a medical surgeon
Something you love to do
Who would've thought it was you
The Devil's in the soup

[HOOK]
The Devil's in the soup (x3)

[VERSE 2]
Break out the mixing spoon
And stir it up with all you got
The soup is getting hotter and hotter
Running all down the side of the pot
Juice is on the covers
I think I smell a little tuna inside that soup
So what you putting in it
The basic four fingered food groups
All alone
'Cause you feed for a minute, add meat and bones
So the Devil's in your soup
Your panties all wet from spilling that soup
Homemade, never stored in cans
Always made with hands
I think your starting to stick to the pot
That means soup's too hot
It's so hot it burns
So stick a spoon in it and give a couple turns
And I thought you was a good girl
Never let nobody inside your world
So the Devil's in the soup
How'd you let the Devil get inside your soup
Been thinking about sex
Next thing you know, you'll be wearing a Kotex
When the walls come down
And the soups in the cupboard there to be found
You've committed sin
But when the Devil's in the soup, it'll happen again

[VERSE 3]
Masturbating, demonstrating good love
Knowing damn well that ain't what you thinking of
You're thinking about coming
For the first time, you're out your mind
You don't know what you're doing
But it feels so good you could think you're screwing
You feel something tingle
As you giggle and start to wiggle but still single
Playing that Esham tape
So much love and so much hate
Your emotions run wild
Feeling more like a woman and less like a child
Get ready for the fountain
'Cause you'll be coming around the mountain
Any minute with the soup
'Cause the Devil's still tasting and she's wasting
Soup in her clothes
But she's the only one that knows
About that dish
Squaggy juice which smells like fish
And she loves to fix it
Her favorite part is when she mix it
Virgins want to have fun to
But when they do

Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade...-uh
We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage...-uh
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Ugh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear
The crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha""
""Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha""

[Hook: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are
A superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh
If you are what you say you are
A superstar (Superstar!)
Then have no fear
The crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh oh oh (Yeah)

159,"So Many Ways (From ""High School High"")","Hello, Morehouse! (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Please be seated.

I have to say that it is one of the great honors of my life to be able to address this gathering here today. I want to thank Dr. Wilson for his outstanding leadership, and the Board of Trustees. We have Congressman Cedric Richmond and Sanford Bishop — both proud alumni of this school, as well as Congressman Hank Johnson. And one of my dear friends and a great inspiration to us all — the great John Lewis is here. (Applause.) We have your outstanding Mayor, Mr. Kasim Reed, in the house. (Applause.)

To all the members of the Morehouse family. And most of all, congratulations to this distinguished group of Morehouse Men — the Class of 2013. (Applause.)

I have to say that it’s a little hard to follow — not Dr. Wilson, but a skinny guy with a funny name. (Laughter.) Betsegaw Tadele — he’s going to be doing something.

I also have to say that you all are going to get wet. (Laughter.) And I’d be out there with you if I could. (Laughter.) But Secret Service gets nervous. (Laughter.) So I’m going to have to stay here, dry. (Laughter.) But know that I’m there with you in spirit. (Laughter.)

Some of you are graduating summa cum laude. (Applause.) Some of you are graduating magna cum laude. (Applause.) I know some of you are just graduating, “thank you, Lordy.” (Laughter and applause.) That’s appropriate because it’s a Sunday. (Laughter.)

I see some moms and grandmas here, aunts, in their Sunday best — although they are upset about their hair getting messed up. (Laughter.) Michelle would not be sitting in the rain. (Laughter.) She has taught me about hair. (Laughter.)

I want to congratulate all of you — the parents, the grandparents, the brothers and sisters, the family and friends who supported these young men in so many ways. This is your day, as well. Just think about it — your sons, your brothers, your nephews — they spent the last four years far from home and close to Spelman, and yet they are still here today. (Applause.) So you’ve done something right. Graduates, give a big round of applause to your family for everything that they’ve done for you. (Applause.)

I know that some of you had to wait in long lines to get into today’s ceremony. And I would apologize, but it did not have anything to do with security. Those graduates just wanted you to know what it’s like to register for classes here. (Laughter and applause.) And this time of year brings a different kind of stress — every senior stopping by Gloster Hall over the past week making sure your name was actually on the list of students who met all the graduation requirements. (Applause.) If it wasn’t on the list, you had to figure out why. Was it that library book you lent to that trifling roommate who didn’t return it? (Laughter.) Was it Dr. Johnson’s policy class? (Applause.) Did you get enough Crown Forum credits? (Applause.)

On that last point, I’m going to exercise my power as President to declare this speech sufficient Crown Forum credits for any otherwise eligible student to graduate. That is my graduation gift to you. (Applause.) You have a special dispensation.

Now, graduates, I am humbled to stand here with all of you as an honorary Morehouse Man. (Applause.) I finally made it. (Laughter.) And as I do, I’m mindful of an old saying: “You can always tell a Morehouse Man — (applause) — but you can’t tell him much.” (Applause.) And that makes my task a little more difficult, I suppose. But I think it also reflects the sense of pride that’s always been part of this school’s tradition.

Benjamin Mays, who served as the president of Morehouse for almost 30 years, understood that tradition better than anybody. He said — and I quote — “It will not be sufficient for Morehouse College, for any college, for that matter, to produce clever graduates — but rather honest men, men who can be trusted in public and private life — men who are sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society and who are willing to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.”

It was that mission — not just to educate men, but to cultivate good men, strong men, upright men — that brought community leaders together just two years after the end of the Civil War. They assembled a list of 37 men, free blacks and freed slaves, who would make up the first prospective class of what later became Morehouse College. Most of those first students had a desire to become teachers and preachers — to better themselves so they could help others do the same.

A century and a half later, times have changed. But the “Morehouse Mystique” still endures. Some of you probably came here from communities where everybody looked like you. Others may have come here in search of a community. And I suspect that some of you probably felt a little bit of culture shock the first time you came together as a class in King’s Chapel. All of a sudden, you weren’t the only high school sports captain, you weren’t the only student council president. You were suddenly in a group of high achievers, and that meant you were expected to do something more.

That’s the unique sense of purpose that this place has always infused — the conviction that this is a training ground not only for individual success, but for leadership that can change the world.

Dr. King was just 15 years old when he enrolled here at Morehouse. He was an unknown, undersized, unassuming young freshman who lived at home with his parents. And I think it’s fair to say he wasn’t the coolest kid on campus — for the suits he wore, his classmates called him “Tweed.” But his education at Morehouse helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America. It was here that he was introduced to the writings of Gandhi and Thoreau, and the theory of civil disobedience. It was here that professors encouraged him to look past the world as it was and fight for the world as it should be. And it was here, at Morehouse, as Dr. King later wrote, where “I realized that nobody — was afraid.”

Not even of some bad weather. I added on that part. (Laughter.) I know it’s wet out there. But Dr. Wilson told me you all had a choice and decided to do it out here anyway. (Applause.) That’s a Morehouse Man talking.

Now, think about it. For black men in the ’40s and the ’50s, the threat of violence, the constant humiliations, large and small, the uncertainty that you could support a family, the gnawing doubts born of the Jim Crow culture that told you every day that somehow you were inferior, the temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid risks, to be afraid — that temptation was necessarily strong.

And yet, here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to be unafraid. And he, in turn, taught others to be unafraid. And over time, he taught a nation to be unafraid. And over the last 50 years, thanks to the moral force of Dr. King and a Moses generation that overcame their fear and their cynicism and their despair, barriers have come tumbling down, and new doors of opportunity have swung open, and laws and hearts and minds have been changed to the point where someone who looks just like you can somehow come to serve as President of these United States of America. (Applause.)

So the history we share should give you hope. The future we share should give you hope. You’re graduating into an improving job market. You’re living in a time when advances in technology and communication put the world at your fingertips. Your generation is uniquely poised for success unlike any generation of African Americans that came before it.

But that doesn’t mean we don’t have work — because if we’re honest with ourselves, we know that too few of our brothers have the opportunities that you’ve had here at Morehouse.

In troubled neighborhoods all across this country — many of them heavily African American — too few of our citizens have role models to guide them. Communities just a couple miles from my house in Chicago, communities just a couple miles from here — they’re places where jobs are still too scarce and wages are still too low; where schools are underfunded and violence is pervasive; where too many of our men spend their youth not behind a desk in a classroom, but hanging out on the streets or brooding behind a jail cell.

My job, as President, is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everybody — policies that strengthen the middle class and give more people the chance to climb their way into the middle class. Policies that create more good jobs and reduce poverty, and educate more children, and give more families the security of health care, and protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence. That’s my job. Those are matters of public policy, and it is important for all of us — black, white and brown — to advocate for an America where everybody has got a fair shot in life. Not just some. Not just a few. (Applause.)

But along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities. There are some things, as black men, we can only do for ourselves. There are some things, as Morehouse Men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind. As Morehouse Men, you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you’re about to collect — and that’s the power of your example.

So what I ask of you today is the same thing I ask of every graduating class I address: Use that power for something larger than yourself. Live up to President Mays’s challenge. Be “sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society.” And be “willing to accept responsibility for correcting (those) ills.”

I know that some of you came to Morehouse from communities where life was about keeping your head down and looking out for yourself. Maybe you feel like you escaped, and now you can take your degree and get that fancy job and the nice house and the nice car — and never look back. And don’t get me wrong — with all those student loans you’ve had to take out, I know you’ve got to earn some money. With doors open to you that your parents and grandparents could not even imagine, no one expects you to take a vow of poverty. But I will say it betrays a poverty of ambition if all you think about is what goods you can buy instead of what good you can do. (Applause.)

So, yes, go get that law degree. But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and the powerful, or if you can also find some time to defend the powerless. Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business. We need black businesses out there. But ask yourselves what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood. The most successful CEOs I know didn’t start out intent just on making money — rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed. (Applause.)

Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors. But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too. For generations, certain groups in this country — especially African Americans — have been desperate in need of access to quality, affordable health care. And as a society, we’re finally beginning to change that. Those of you who are under the age of 26 already have the option to stay on your parent’s health care plan. But all of you are heading into an economy where many young people expect not only to have multiple jobs, but multiple careers.

So starting October 1st, because of the Affordable Care Act — otherwise known as Obamacare — (applause) — you’ll be able to shop for a quality, affordable plan that’s yours and travels with you — a plan that will insure not only your health, but your dreams if you are sick or get in an accident. But we’re going to need some doctors to make sure it works, too. We’ve got to make sure everybody has good health in this country. It’s not just good for you, it’s good for this country. So you’re going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.

Which brings me to a second point: Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves. We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices. And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself. Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down. I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing. But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is there’s no longer any room for excuses. (Applause.)

I understand there’s a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: “Excuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.” Well, we’ve got no time for excuses. Not because the bitter legacy of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there. It’s just that in today’s hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil — many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did — all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned. (Applause.)

Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you’ve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured — and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too. (Applause.)

You now hail from a lineage and legacy of immeasurably strong men — men who bore tremendous burdens and still laid the stones for the path on which we now walk. You wear the mantle of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and Ralph Bunche and Langston Hughes, and George Washington Carver and Ralph Abernathy and Thurgood Marshall, and, yes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These men were many things to many people. And they knew full well the role that racism played in their lives. But when it came to their own accomplishments and sense of purpose, they had no time for excuses.

Every one of you have a grandma or an uncle or a parent who’s told you that at some point in life, as an African American, you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by. I think President Mays put it even better: He said, “Whatever you do, strive to do it so well that no man living and no man dead, and no man yet to be born can do it any better.” (Applause.)

And I promise you, what was needed in Dr. Mays’s time, that spirit of excellence, and hard work, and dedication, and no excuses is needed now more than ever. If you think you can just get over in this economy just because you have a Morehouse degree, you’re in for a rude awakening. But if you stay hungry, if you keep hustling, if you keep on your grind and get other folks to do the same — nobody can stop you. (Applause.)

And when I talk about pursuing excellence and setting an example, I’m not just talking about in your professional life. One of today’s graduates, Frederick Anderson — where’s Frederick? Frederick, right here. (Applause.) I know it’s raining, but I’m going to tell about Frederick. Frederick started his college career in Ohio, only to find out that his high school sweetheart back in Georgia was pregnant. So he came back and enrolled in Morehouse to be closer to her. Pretty soon, helping raise a newborn and working night shifts became too much, so he started taking business classes at a technical college instead — doing everything from delivering newspapers to buffing hospital floors to support his family.

And then he enrolled at Morehouse a second time. But even with a job, he couldn’t keep up with the cost of tuition. So after getting his degree from that technical school, this father of three decided to come back to Morehouse for a third time. (Applause.) As Frederick says, “God has a plan for my life, and He’s not done with me yet.”

And today, Frederick is a family man, and a working man, and a Morehouse Man. (Applause.) And that’s what I’m asking all of you to do: Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. (Applause.) Be the best husband to your wife, or you’re your boyfriend, or your partner. Be the best father you can be to your children. Because nothing is more important.

I was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents — made incredible sacrifices for me. And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you. But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved.

Didn’t know my dad. And so my whole life, I’ve tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me. I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home — (applause) — where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter. I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man.

It’s hard work that demands your constant attention and frequent sacrifice. And I promise you, Michelle will tell you I’m not perfect. She’s got a long list of my imperfections. (Laughter.) Even now, I’m still practicing, I’m still learning, still getting corrected in terms of how to be a fine husband and a good father. But I will tell you this: Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family, if we fail at that responsibility. (Applause.)

I know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I passed; I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted; I will not be thinking about the speech I gave, I will not be thinking the Nobel Prize I received. I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters. I’ll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife. I’ll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing that they were loved. And I’ll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them.

So be a good role model, set a good example for that young brother coming up. If you know somebody who’s not on point, go back and bring that brother along — those who’ve been left behind, who haven’t had the same opportunities we have — they need to hear from you. You’ve got to be engaged on the barbershops, on the basketball court, at church, spend time and energy and presence to give people opportunities and a chance. Pull them up, expose them, support their dreams. Don’t put them down.

We’ve got to teach them just like what we have to learn, what it means to be a man — to serve your city like Maynard Jackson; to shape the culture like Spike Lee; to be like Chester Davenport, one of the first people to integrate the University of Georgia Law School. When he got there, nobody would sit next to him in class. But Chester didn’t mind. Later on, he said, “It was the thing for me to do. Someone needed to be the first.” And today, Chester is here celebrating his 50th reunion. Where is Chester Davenport? He’s here. (Applause.)

So if you’ve had role models, fathers, brothers like that — thank them today. And if you haven’t, commit yourself to being that man to somebody else.

And finally, as you do these things, do them not just for yourself, but don’t even do them just for the African American community. I want you to set your sights higher. At the turn of the last century, W.E.B. DuBois spoke about the “talented tenth” — a class of highly educated, socially conscious leaders in the black community. But it’s not just the African American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you.

As Morehouse Men, many of you know what it’s like to be an outsider; know what it’s like to be marginalized; know what it’s like to feel the sting of discrimination. And that’s an experience that a lot of Americans share. Hispanic Americans know that feeling when somebody asks them where they come from or tell them to go back. Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love that they share. Muslim Americans feel it when they’re stared at with suspicion because of their faith. Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work — she knows what it’s like to be on the outside looking in.

So your experiences give you special insight that today’s leaders need. If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy — the understanding of what it’s like to walk in somebody else’s shoes, to see through their eyes, to know what it’s like when you’re not born on 3rd base, thinking you hit a triple. It should give you the ability to connect. It should give you a sense of compassion and what it means to overcome barriers.

And I will tell you, Class of 2013, whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs, and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy — the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didn’t have the opportunities that I had — because there but for the grace of God, go I — I might have been in their shoes. I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me. (Applause.)

So it’s up to you to widen your circle of concern — to care about justice for everybody, white, black and brown. Everybody. Not just in your own community, but also across this country and around the world. To make sure everyone has a voice, and everybody gets a seat at the table; that everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, what your last name is — it doesn’t matter, everybody gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they are willing to work hard enough.

When Leland Shelton was four years old — where’s Leland? (Applause.) Stand up, Leland. When Leland Shelton was four years old, social services took him away from his mama, put him in the care of his grandparents. By age 14, he was in the foster care system. Three years after that, Leland enrolled in Morehouse. And today he is graduating Phi Beta Kappa on his way to Harvard Law School. (Applause.) But he’s not stopping there. As a member of the National Foster Care Youth and Alumni Policy Council, he plans to use his law degree to make sure kids like him don’t fall through the cracks. And it won’t matter whether they’re black kids or brown kids or white kids or Native American kids, because he’ll understand what they’re going through. And he’ll be fighting for them. He’ll be in their corner. That’s leadership. That’s a Morehouse Man right there. (Applause.)

That’s what we’ve come to expect from you, Morehouse — a legacy of leaders — not just in our black community, but for the entire American community. To recognize the burdens you carry with you, but to resist the temptation to use them as excuses. To transform the way we think about manhood, and set higher standards for ourselves and for others. To be successful, but also to understand that each of us has responsibilities not just to ourselves, but to one another and to future generations. Men who refuse to be afraid. Men who refuse to be afraid.

Members of the Class of 2013, you are heirs to a great legacy. You have within you that same courage and that same strength, the same resolve as the men who came before you. That’s what being a Morehouse Man is all about. That’s what being an American is all about.

Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what’s right, if you work harder and dream bigger, if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our time, then I’m confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union.

Congratulations, Class of 2013. God bless you. God bless Morehouse. And God bless the United States of America. (Applause.)",Barack Obama,1996,"[100, 83, 84, 90, 100, 94, 97, 94]",8

A Memoir of a Childhood

By Frank McCourt

This book is dedicated to my brothers, Malachy, Michael, Alphonsus. I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.

Acknowledgments

This is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.
R'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.
Lisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.
Mary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third
and passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.
And Molly was right.
My daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.
My wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final
page.
I am blessed among men.


I
My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.
When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.
People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.
Above all-we were wet.
Out in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.
It created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.
From October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.
The rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.
Limerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the
rain.
My father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County
Antrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.
When I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.
Because of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.
After wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.
My mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.
After a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?
Nobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.
He's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles
a bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.
Grandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.
She runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.
Little Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.
My mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.
My grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.
St. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.
Ah, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.
And the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.
Love her as in childhood
Though feeble, old and grey.
For you'll never miss a mother's love
Till she's buried beneath the clay.
At the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.
She arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.
With Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.
A knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.
That knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.
Delia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.
Steps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.
Malachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.
Philomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.
Jimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.
Delia said, You shuddup.
Tommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.
Och, I am, said Malachy. I am.
Nobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.
And while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.
Malachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little
talk.
Take the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.
Philomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than
you are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.
Jimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Another thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd
manner.
Malachy smiled. I do?
about
You do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.
'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.
Och, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry
that girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.
Och, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.
There's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.
You shuddup, said Delia.
Malachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.
Bet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.
Malachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.
He awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.
On the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.
Not until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.
There was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.
After baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.
Malachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.
At Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say
that... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.
If I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?
I am, Philomena.
A year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.
The MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.
Their husbands agreed.
I'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.
Up, down, up, down.
Malachy goes up.
I get off.
Malachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is
on his mouth and there's blood.
Oh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.
And here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly
slows her.
She says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?
In the middle of the day?
She pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.
My father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside
the child?
did.
our building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a
dog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.
Malachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.
I pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the
dog.
Oh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All
the same blood.
Minnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She
tells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.
Mr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.
Will Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?
It was his time, Francis.
The apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother
shakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other
room.
My father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white
enamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.
Dad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?
Cuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story
when you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.
I say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a
different name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?
Setanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.
That's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.
He finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.
For days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.
Malachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.
In the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.
I try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.
When he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.
She tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.
I wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.
I'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam
says,
They get their appetites because they're starving half the time.
When Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,
It had to be and the reason is this
Could it be true, someone like you
Could love me, love me?
When Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is
say a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.
When Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.
All seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.
Come and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.
But Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,
From neither of them shall I part.
For one is my mother,
God bless her and love her,
The other is my sweetheart.
Malachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.
When we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.
When Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?
Malachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?
Mam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.
He comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.
Deep in Canadian woods we met
From one bright island flown.
Great is the land we tread, but yet
Our hearts are with our own.
Up, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.
Mam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
isn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she
I want them up, he says. I want them
be free from the center to the sea.
Don't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.
a penny in your pocket without
says.
ready for the day Ireland will
do it'll be a sorry day in
He pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?
Mam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.
On the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.
Mam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?
He puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he
says.
Later in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram
and off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.
We come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.
We wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.
When the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street
herself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?
She goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?
No, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.
We go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.
It's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.
The man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.
I'm looking for my father. Is my father here?
Naw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?
His name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.
Malarkey?
No, Malachy.
Malachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?
He calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy
Malachy what sings Kevin Barry?
Men shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin
Barry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'
da woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.
The man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.
Mam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.
Mam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.
When we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?
The Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.
Oh, she says, I don't want much.
Anything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.
We have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.
I crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.
The next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.
He takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.
We spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.
When he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.
We can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.
They don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.
Minnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.
Clap hands, clap hands,
Till Daddy comes home,
For Daddy has money
And Mammy has none.
Malachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the
song.
and I
song.
That's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's
Minnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can
knows
sing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.
Minnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.
sings
When Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.
With scarlet cap and coat of green
A cruiskeen by his side.
'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.
Oh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.
He walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.
The more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.
The twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.
Mam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.
Och, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.
My mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.
Minnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?
Everyone.
The twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.
We race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.
If I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?
The Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.
My mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.
That's what I'll say. A man.
Then the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.
I go to him.
You the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?
Yes, sir.
Heah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.
Right? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.
Thank you, sir.
Jeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?
My father told me to say thanks, sir.
Your father? Oh, well.
Dad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President
Roosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.
Where did you get that fruit?
The man.
What man?
The Italian man gave it to me.
Did you steal that fruit?
Malachy says, The man. The man
And what did you do to Freddie
Lovely woman. I don't know what we'd
And you had to attack poor Freddie.
gave Frankie the bag.
Leibowitz? His mother was here.
do without her and Minnie MacAdorey.
Malachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.
Dad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.
My mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.
But Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?
I don't.
My parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He
was only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.
Och, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has
his own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?
Dad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.
What's Samson?
If you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?
The baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.
They're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.
Mrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.
She's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.
Sick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.
We sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.
Mrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.
Malachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.
Were on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.
Yes, Papa. Papa.
That's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my
father.
My mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still
early and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,
Och.
Mam says, Is she, is she sick?
Och, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.
My mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.
Go for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.
We wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.
I fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.
Why is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?
I get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.
Dad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?
My father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.
Mam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.
The twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the
cold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.
After we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?
She's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.
Oh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.
Malachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.
So, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.
After we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy
vey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.
She helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.
Mrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?
My mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.
Mrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.
In the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?
I don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.
What's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?
Oh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.
She spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.
Leibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.
I wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.
Minnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.
I don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?
I don't know.
Minnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.
Malachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.
Minnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.
Here he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.
Mrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.
Two days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.
We will, Dad, we will.
All together we sing Kevin Barry,
On Mountjoy one Monday morning,
High upon the gallows tree,
Kevin Barry gave his young life
For the cause of liberty.
Just a lad of eighteen summers
Sure there's no one can deny
As he marched to death that morning
How he held his head on high.
There's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.
Och, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.
You can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.
I know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed
now like a dacent man.
Bed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and
night, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?
Of course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.
One more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.
Come on, boys. Sing.
Because he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green
He goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;
True to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;
Young Roddy McCorley goes to die
On the bridge at Toome today.
You'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?
We will, Dad.
And we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.
My brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the
table and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.
That night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at
him. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.
In the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.
Most of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.
Minnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.
Mr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?
He'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.
We get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.
The man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.
Mr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.
Two big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?
I'm four going on five.
You're not very big for your age, are you?
I don't know.
Is your mother here?
She's in the bed.
What is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the
day?
She's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your
mother.
They brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell
of this place. And who are these children?
Malachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see
how white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.
Malachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.
The big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.
Good God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?
Malachy says, They're all shitty.
Delia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.
What's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.
The big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.
That's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.
They would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?
Mrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.
Not my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.
You needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.
You'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.
Mind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.
And Philomena has no answer for that.
Minnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.
I wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.
Delia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.
Mrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.
I remain your loving neice
Philomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)
Grandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.
The ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.
II
In a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.
Dad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Cows, son.
What are cows, Dad?
Cows are cows, son.
We walked farther along the brightening road and there were other
creatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?
Sheep, son.
What are sheep, Dad?
My father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?
And Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.
Dad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?
Dad said, Good morning, Father.
Father? I said. Dad, is that your father?
Mam said, Don't ask him any questions.
Dad said, No, no, this is a priest.
Malachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are
you going?
Dad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest
took us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.
At the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.
We make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.
Och, says Grandpa, you're here.
Och, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?
Malachy says, What's boxty?
Dad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.
Grandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all
the eggs you can hold.
We have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I
wake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.
What?
Under the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.
I want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.
Now Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.
In the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when
Dad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.
Grandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.
It's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.
Dad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.
Dad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.
Where would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?
Och, I could go on the dole, I suppose.
You can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?
Dad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.
You'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.
You're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.
Dad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.
After we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.
Malachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.
Is that right, Dad?
'Tis.
Mam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on
top of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.
Soon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.
Och, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.
When the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.
Your Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.
Dad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.
But Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.
Free, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.
A woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.
The woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.
Mr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.
Mr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.
Oh, it's the drink you want, is it?
One pint is hardly drink.
You'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a
pint, wouldn't you?
Walking never killed anyone.
I want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a
guard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.
Night falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.
They're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.
The man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.
At the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.
The guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.
The sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The
guard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.
Dad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.
****
Dad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?
I tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.
Oh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.
Mam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?
Mam shakes her head, no.
Ah, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.
But Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.
All right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.
She goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.
Mam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.
'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.
Dad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.
The driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.
Mam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.
And I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.
The driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?
Dad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.
Well, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.
The sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.
Dad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'
'tis a rich man's foolishness.
Along the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the
boys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.
There is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.
There is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.
Under the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.
Malachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.
Grandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.
There aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.
Malachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.
Grandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to
ye.
She won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with
laughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.
Dad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's
sleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.
Are you going to behave yourself?
Malachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad
never raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.
That night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.
Aunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?
She spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.
In the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?
When she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.
That day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.
The room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.
Dad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.
Then Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,
Oh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better
soon.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on
his trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.
A man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.
Dad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?
A cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.
He struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,
though I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.
He wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.
Mam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.
We slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.
Mam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.
A few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.
Mam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?
My mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.
Now Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.
Leave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.
She tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.
Dad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt
Aggie
Pa is
about
never looks at him.
telling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,
Malachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?
Och, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.
I wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three
four of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.
It's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.
Later, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.
When he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.
Dad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles ""The Boys of Wexford. "" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.
Next day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.
Mam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.
They all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.
The young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.
The woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your
loss.
Another woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?
Ah, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.
They can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?
I do, says Mam, but I don't have them.
Nora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.
The worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.
Quinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?
A door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?
Women raise their hands, I am. I am.
Well, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.
They're all gone, I told you.
But 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.
The boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's
smoking?
Nora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to
the last ash.
Every puff you take, he starts.
I know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.
Is that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know
where I will.
What are you talking about?
I'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.
Mr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know
what we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.
other
Then, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?
He stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the
women. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.
What are you tittering about? he barks.
Oh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.
I'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind
him.
One by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out
she's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.
When Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.
He turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.
Mr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.
The other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.
The third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.
Mam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.
The women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.
Nora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.
She leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.
She says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?
No. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.
The woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.
I don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?
Ah, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?
Mrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.
That scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it does, says Nora.
But my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.
I'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the
St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.
I try to be a good Catholic.
Try? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known
for having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.
Well, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...
God bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?
Well, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.
If you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.
All right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.
God bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.
On the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.
You're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.
She drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de
Paul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.
Eugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.
She gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.
What are we going to do now, Dad?
I don't know, son.
Ahead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal
along the road.
There, Dad, there's coal.
Och, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk
and eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.
If you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.
She gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.
The minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs
in.
Oonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.
Mam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm
sorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each
side of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?
Ah, no, says Mam. An onion.
The woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?
Mam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.
True for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.
Mam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.
The woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.
Mam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.
I'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?
Ah, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.
Well, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.
Mam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.
Dad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?
I did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.
I got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.
Dad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.
Then you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.
Malachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.
She gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.
Ah, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.
He tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.
The fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.
Soon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.
In the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.
Mam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.
When Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.
Ollie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.
Ollie, Ollie, I want Ollie.
He follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.
Grandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?
Oliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?
Wouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.
And who's minding ye?
I am.
And what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.
his name?
Have ye any
porridge here?
What's porridge? says Malachy.
Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is
porridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.
She picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.
Do you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.
Porridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a
little porridge.
And I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of
everything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.
Jesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.
Grandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.
Malachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.
Malachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.
I think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.
Aw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?
And Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.
Grandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.
Aunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.
Pa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.
Malachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.
Grandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.
She puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.
***
We followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.
But he kept looking out the window.
She told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.
Dad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.
Mam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to
Thompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.
She goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.
Dad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.
He picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.
He tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.
Dad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.
A few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?
There are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.
Dad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.
He laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.
Dad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he
yells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.
The man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.
Dad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.
Uncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.
But Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.
Dad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.
Dad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.
Next day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.
I did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.
The morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.
He wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.
There lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.
Sing, Oh, let man learn liberty
From crashing wind and lashing sea.
He stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.
Mam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.
She tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.
She struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.
He blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.
He staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.
Then he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.
***
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.
He tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.
On Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to
return on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?
Mam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.
The boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
A big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?
I tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.
The boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.
Mr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.
He tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.
I'm a bad boy.
Now say, I'm a bad Yank.
I'm a bad Yank.
Malachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we
were cowboys and gangsters.
Is that what you did, Heffernan?
I was only jokin', sir.
No more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.
And you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night
and thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.
I won't, sir.
And if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.
There are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're
late, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.
They hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.
They hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you
about the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.
One master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is
the greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.
Mr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.
Mr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.
If you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit
you.
Even if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or
the blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.
Big boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.
It is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.
If the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.
I know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.
Dad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.
Malachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.
He sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.
Dad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.
***
He died anyway.
Six months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning
and there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.
Grandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles
of stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that
night as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.
Dad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.
He helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.
Grandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.
At the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?
He's, he's, in the pub.
Of course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.
She tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.
Dad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.
That's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.
Now, son. Now, son.
Dad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?
Dad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.
Don't be a bad boy.
No.
The other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.
Dad says, All right. We'll go.
They finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.
The man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.
The man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.
The men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing ""The Road to Rasheen"" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing ""The Road to Rasheen, "" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?
Mam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.
Grandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.
Uncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.
Oh, Pat, she says. Pat.
I can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.
I know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.
I'll lift him an' I won't be singin'""The Road to Rasheen.""
I know you won't, Pat, Mam says.
Pat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.
Eugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.
Uncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his
face.
Aunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the
coffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.
I don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.
The horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.
Mam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.
Malachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.
At the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.
Do what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.
It's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.
Two men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.
The man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.
Dad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.
We make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.
It's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.
The fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.
When we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.
Dad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.
Malachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home
the money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.
III
Mam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.
We move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.
Mam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.
It takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.
Mam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?
Cleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.
And he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.
Mam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.
Dad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.
Oh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?
Dad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.
Och, what am I going to do? Dad says.
Take down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.
I can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.
Suit yourself, says Mam.
I will, says Dad.
This is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in
the lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.
If you haven't a penny
A ha'penny will do
And if you haven't a ha'penny
God bless you.
Boys tease the girls and call out,
May your mother have an accident
Abroad in the loo.
Mam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?
Dad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?
Bosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.
I ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.
When he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.
When the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.
You wouldn't do that, Angela.
I would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.
Bed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll
only have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.
He goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.
And he smiles.
Two weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....
Mam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in
Limerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.
No goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.
He tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.
Mam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.
No, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.
And what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.
And a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.
The butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.
I am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.
The butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.
Sure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.
I know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.
Mam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the
pig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?
One calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's
head?
No, I don't, Paddy.
Grab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.
And Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?
No, I don't, Christy.
The only part they don't ate is the oink.
After a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone
can see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is
laughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.
I wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.
He's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.
On Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?
Mam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.
Mam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.
She says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.
It's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag
when Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.
He takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.
It takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.
We have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?
Malachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.
The downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.
It's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.
There are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.
Mam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.
Dad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.
He says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.
He eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.
It's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.
The angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Malachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.
Malachy wants to know what an affliction is.
Affliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.
I know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.
Dad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the
spitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.
I want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.
So I find the seventh step by counting from the top.
The baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.
Mam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.
Michael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?
Upstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.
They want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.
They say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.
They say, Mother of God.
Mam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?
The men.
What men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.
They're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and
they make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?
Dad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.
Malachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.
Mam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.
When they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.
I have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.
Dad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?
Don't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?
And what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go
barefoot?
I'd rather fix the shoes they have.
The shoes they have are falling to pieces.
I can fix them, he says.
You can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.
He comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to
Mr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes
you're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.
There are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.
There are no hands.
He says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?
No, sir.
What is it you don't see Our Lord doing?
Hanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.
Now if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at
McCourt or his brother over their
will come out, boys?
The stick, sir.
The stick will sting, boys.
air, it will land on the backside
sneers. Where will it land, boys?
shoes the stick will come out. What
The ash plant will whistle through the
of the boy that jeers, the boy that
On the boy that jeers, sir.
And?
The boy that sneers, sir.
The boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber
tires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.
If I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.
I could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.
I sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.
I stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.
I get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.
He laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.
Before Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.
In fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.
Easter is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.
Dad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.
At the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.
But, Dad.
Shush, it's a mystery.
There's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they
tell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.
Dad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.
The cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.
Friday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.
Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...
There isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.
Pop. She's in a good mood.
Sirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.
The men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.
We have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?
The women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be
the saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.
The darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.
The women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.
I know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.
He stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.
He's pushing in our door and singing,
And if, when all a vigil keep,
The West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,
That Connacht lies in slumber deep,
But hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'
He calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?
She doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.
I want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.
Dad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,
stepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.
Michael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.
He stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.
Malachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.
And I tell him I don't want it, either.
Dad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his
pocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.
IV
The master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.
The master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.
The master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.
It's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.
It's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a
rage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.
Nora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.
If he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.
Mikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.
You can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.
The children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.
My father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?
Nora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?
Are you sure, Mikey?
I am. I read it in a book.
He sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over
his First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.
What about James Cagney?
Never mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to
every little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.
Mikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.
He says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.
The master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?
The master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do
what you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?
I do.
I do what?
I do, sir.
He goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will
never know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?
'Tis, sir.
Question Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.
What's henchmen, sir?
The master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.
Look at this specimen, he roars.
Question is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.
The master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,
sir.
The day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take
you to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?
That God will take me to His bosom, sir.
Go back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from
the far dark corner of a bog.
He sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells
Question to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.
what?
What will I do, boys?
Flog the boy, sir.
Till?
Till the blood spurts, sir.
Now, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?
Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery
Thou shalt not commit adultery, sir.
And what is adultery, Clohessy?
Impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.
Good, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in
the sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.
Paddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.
I think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.
Mr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.
The priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy
Communion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?
Extreme Unction, sir.
That's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.
He tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.
He tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?
We have, sir.
What have we done, boys?
Bared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.
And?
Mounted the scaffold singing, sir.
As if?
Embarking on a picnic, sir.
He says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a
martyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.
But it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember
this, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?
We are, sir.
And what's enough?
The gift of Faith, sir.
Good. Go home.
At night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the
lane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.
Cuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.
Mikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.
I don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.
But now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about
Cuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.
I'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.
Dad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?
He does.
Would the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?
Och, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.
Dad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.
He's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.
Do not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.
Next morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?
I tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.
Dad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?
I tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.
But the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.
All right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?
'Tis, Dad.
The day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to
hell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.
We kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.
I try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.
It's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.
The panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?
I told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's
purse. I said a curse.
Yes, my child. Anything else?
I, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.
Surely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by
certain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.
'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.
How was that, my child?
She won him in a pissing contest.
There is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth
and he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?
Mikey Molloy, Father.
And where did he hear it?
He read it in a book, Father.
Ah, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?
I will, Father.
Are there any other sins, my child?
No, Father.
For your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a
special prayer for me.
I will. Father, was that the worst sin?
What do you mean?
Am I the worst of all the boys, Father?
No, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of
Contrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.
First Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.
Get up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.
I ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.
They dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.
Come here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.
She spat twice on my head.
Grandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.
We ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.
It's on my tongue. I draw it back.
It stuck.
I had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's
voice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.
I tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.
God was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.
When the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.
Mam, can I go now and make The Collection?
She said, After you have a little breakfast.
No, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a
proper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.
We followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained
that the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.
Go aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?
The food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.
Look at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.
She dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.
In the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.
A day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?
I overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.
The priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.
Ah... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.
Grandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?
He said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?
He didn't say, Grandma.
Well, go back and ask him.
But, Grandma...
She pushed me back into the confessional.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last
confession.
A minute! Are you the boy that was just here?
I am, Father.
What is it now?
My grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and
tell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.
I told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering
him again.
Don't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.
I asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.
Grandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.
Mam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.
No he's not.
Yes he is.
Grandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will
save his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.
She pulled her shawl around her and walked away.
Mam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll
never see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.
We met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?
I was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.
What's a diversion?
I have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.
Mam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.
Mikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.

Grandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.
That's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.
Uncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.
People in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.
In every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.
It's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.
They say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.
Mam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.
Mam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?
What poem, Angela?
'Tis called ""The Man from the North. "" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.
I never heard that poem. Say it for me.
Mam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.
And I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.
Oh, Garryowen may be more gay
Than this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down
On the river that runs through my native town.
But there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide
And Limerick town has no happier hearth
Than mine has been with my man from the North.
I wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.
She always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.
If he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.
Bridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.
Grandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.
Uncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.
Uncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two
meals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.
Grandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.
Bill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.
Uncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.
Bill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.
Grandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.
Every morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?
Mam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.
I don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.
You're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your
pals.
Grandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be
meandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants
it.
There's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and
cabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.
It's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.
The second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.
What am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was
attacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.
Oh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.
She'll kill me.
Tell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.
Grandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.
He wants more dinner.
What do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?
He's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?
He says send him any class of a dinner.
I will not. I sent him his dinner.
He didn't get it.
He didn't? Why not?
I ate it.
What?
I was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.
Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.
She gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She
screams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.
Take these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.
Of course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.
Every day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.
Mam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.
There may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an
American and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.
When the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.
The teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?
The teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?
Dad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.
The doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.
The tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.
Next day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.
On a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.
Dance? Why?
You're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.
She tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.
What's ancestors?
Never mind, she says, you're going to dance.
I wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for
Ireland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.
Mam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.
Cyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.
Mam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.
If my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.
My uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.
There's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?
We do, Mrs. O'Connor.
Mam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.
Ah, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.
She waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with
kinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.
I don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.
Maura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.
Mrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.
Boys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.
Mam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good
laugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.
I don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.
They turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.
Mam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.
The fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.
He waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.
I tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.
Dad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did ""The Siege of Ennis"" and ""The Walls of Limerick, "" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called ""The Siege of Dingle""but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.
Next week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.
I have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned ""The Walls of Cork"" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, ""Walls o' Cork, "" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?
I can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.
Dad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.
The priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.
I'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.
Mam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.
Oh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.
Mam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.
Bridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.
Bridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?
And they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.
'Tis.
Question Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.
Question says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.
Everyone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.
Our Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.
The Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing ""I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, "" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.
The prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.
The worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane
and roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.
The Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?
I do, Declan.
Boys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.
Declan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.
Other boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.
Dad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.
He says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.
Every evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.
The Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to
the other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.
In a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.
Dad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.
Stephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.
Dad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?
There's no room for him.
Oh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.
Och, aye.
Oh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?
Och, he might grow up to be a priest.
I ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.
VI
Mr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with
a platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.
Brendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?
We expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?
Brendan Quigley, sir.
This is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?
Far, sir.
Indeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the
grace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?
Up, sir.
Without Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.
Paddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.
Dotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?
Clohessy, sir.
Ah, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.
Paddy what?
Paddy, sir.
And what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we
down on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.
I'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in
What do I see, boys?
The lie, sir.
And what is the lie doing, boys?
Festering, sir.
Where, boys, where?
In his teeth, sir.
Euclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.
Clohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you
should get
your teeth.
know what a
Greek is?
Yes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.
Dotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model
himself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.
We listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.
Next day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?
The little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.
He lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?
Grace, sir.
And?
Beauty, sir.
And?
Elegance, sir.
Euclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you
understand that, boys?
We do, sir.
I doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.
He opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.
Paddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your
name?
Clohessy, sir.
What class are you in?
Fourth class, sir.
Now tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about
Euclid?
He is, sir.
And what is he saying?
He's saying he's a Greek.
Of course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.
Ah. Now is he drawing anything on the board?
He's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they
land on God's shoulders.
Mother o' God.
No, sir. God's shoulders.
I know, you idiot. Go home.
The next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.
The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.
Well, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.
Mr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.
You have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.
I'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.
Mr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?
It is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.
There are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.
He peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.
Clohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?
I don't, sir.
It's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun
is a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.
Clohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.
He pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?
Every hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.
Then he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?
Mulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.
And what are you, Mulcahy?
An omadhaun, sir.
Fintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.
Of course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.
Of course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.
The apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve
heights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?
You did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.
Why, Fintan?
They're my friends, sir.
The boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I
feel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.
Quigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.
The whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.
After school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.
Paddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.
Fintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.
Don't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.
Ah, no, Fintan.
Ah, do, Francis.
All right, Fintan.
Fintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred
Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.
There's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?
The fourth of October.
That's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.
Mrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.
Fintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.
We eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.
Now I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.
Paddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?
He is, Paddy.
The way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?
'Tis, Paddy.
A few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?
Fintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.
Boys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the
hopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.
Paddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.
It's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.
Fintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.
I'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.
Paddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.
Oh, Patrick.
Oh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.
Fintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard
in Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.
There are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.
I get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.
It's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.
We're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.
The rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.
What's that dot for, Paddy?
It shows they're high class, the quality.
But, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?
Course they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
Steam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?
Naw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.
And I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.
Question Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.
Oh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.
My mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.
I could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.
We throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.
Paddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.
It's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.
There's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?
'Tis, Mammy.
I'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?
I didn't.
Well, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small
fireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.
She finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.
Mr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.
And what's your mother's name?
Angela, Mr. Clohessy.
Ah, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?
'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.
He hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.
Champion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?
Ah, no, Mr. Clohessy.
Paddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.
Well, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.
I can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.
No good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.
My shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.
Frankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.
I have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.
Mr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.
Paddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my
other shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.
I will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.
You could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.
If they were to get it they'd have it be now.
The fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.
It's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.
I drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.
There's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more
important question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,
ha.
Michael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,
Frankie.
She says, Where were you all night?
I was here.
You had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick
looking for you.
Mr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?
It's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.
God above, is that Angela?
'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.
He struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you
come in, Angela. Don't you know me?
Mam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out
who is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.
'Tis, Angela.
Ah, no.
I know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I
remember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.
My mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.
We could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.
He has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?
I am, Guard.
Don't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.
I won't, Guard. I won't torment her.
He leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.
Mr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?
'Tis, Dennis.
The doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.
Mam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.
I have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.
Before you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?
I will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.
Would you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?
That's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.
Ah, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.
Mam says, All right. I'll try.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
When the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.
She stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.
Oh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.
Mr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.
God bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.
'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.
Quiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother
was.
Mam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.
I know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a
bit strange?
Ah, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The
father is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.
We walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.
She lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.
She comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.
I'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.
VII
There are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the
call comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, ""The West's Asleep, ""
""O'Donnell Abu, ""
""The Boys of Wexford. "" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.
It's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.
I'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.
But this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.
What's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?
Well, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.
Who could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and
St. Thérèse of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.
One of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.
My mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?
We came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.
She yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?
No.
But, Mickey, you promised...
She slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till
Billy Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.
One of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.
Proddy Woddy ring the bell,
Not for heaven but for hell.
On Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?
He says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?
Grandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.
But he's only nine and still in school.
School. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.
He has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.
Never mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.
I meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.
We make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?
Uncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?
No, Uncle Pa.
You're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?
Grandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.
Come on, 'tis gettin' dark.
He hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which
doesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.
Tanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?
One, Uncle Pat.
Take that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.
I bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?
The paper, Mr. Timoney.
We don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?
I'm his nephew, sir.
Is it Gerry Sheehan we have here?
No, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.
Another nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory
in the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper
or keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?
Frank, sir.
Can you read?
I can, sir.
Do you want to earn a sixpence?
I do, sir.
Come here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.
Your name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.
I will, sir.
Are you sure you can read?
I am, sir.
You can call me Mr. Timoney.
I will, Mr. Timoney.
Uncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me
money an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?
Oh, all right, Ab, all right.
The bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Café where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.
The dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.
The Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?
No, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.
He stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?
He gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.
Mam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.
The next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?
He's my uncle.
You're supposed to be at the Confraternity.
I'm working, Declan.
You're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're
destroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?
Uncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.
Ah, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.
Uncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.
At the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.
Mam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.
Next morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.
You're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are
always telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.
He lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.
Nothing, Mr. Timoney.
I think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.
Declan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.
He makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and
uncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells
knows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in
works. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you
I'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.
Mr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.
Uncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.
A woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.
That's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.
Could I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.
And he laughs.
Mam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.
Declan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's
see it. have
my
me he
the gas
what
prefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.
Mam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.
Then one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.
Why, Dad?
Never mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.
He stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.
Then there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new
baby?
Och, aye, son.
I'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.
Mam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.
Don't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.
We sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.
In a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Stop your ticklin',
Ickle ickle icklin
Stop your ticklin', Jock.
Dad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.
Bridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.
Mam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.
Ronald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.
No, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?
Jesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.
Still an' all, Bridey, he's right.
Suddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.
Bridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.
She pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.
Mam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.
She's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.
Yerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.
While Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.
I have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.
Mam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.
Grandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.
Bridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.
He has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?
The babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.
They would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.
They dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.
Malachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?
Alphonsus Joseph.
The words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even
Irish.
Grandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella
needs a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.
I stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.
The house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.
In awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.
Mam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.
I don't want it. You can keep it.
I said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.
Rue? What's rue?
Never mind what's rue. Come down here at once.
Her voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.
In the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd
think he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.
The lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.
Grandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.
Malachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.
Now, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.
Now, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.
He walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read
him out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.
We walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.
He's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.
I have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.
The Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.
Why, my child?
I was hungry, Father.
And why were you hungry?
There was nothing in my belly, Father.
He says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his
head. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.
I wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?
I tell him I do but I don't.
Go home, child. Pray for me.
No penance, Father?
No, my child.
I stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.
You're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to
himself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.
'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.
My heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.
She's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.
VIII
I'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.
Mikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.
Mikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.
The grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.
That's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.
Quasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?
But you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?
Quasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.
Billy signs.
Friday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.
Quasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.
Quasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.
He's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!
Mikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.
Our mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.
But Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.
She drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.
I swear.
If you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.
I swear.
Only the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.
I swear.
All right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that
misfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.
We are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism
question, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?
But I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want
to lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.
She helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?
Dad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.
The day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.
Dr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.
Mam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.
The bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.
I fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking
me and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.
It's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.
Sister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.
My ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.
Son, are you awake?
I try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?
The tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.
Sister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?
Dad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.
The other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.
The room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?
I'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?
I am.
Are you better?
I am.
Well, why are you here?
I don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and
give me medicine.
What do you look like?
I wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.
Yoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?
I am.
What's your name?
Frank.
That's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.
But I'll be eleven in August, next month.
Well, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you
want to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.
I have diphtheria and something else.
What's something else?
They don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts
because my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?
I have black hair.
You and millions.
I have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.
You and thousands.
I have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where
they put in the soldier's blood.
Oh, God, did they?
They did.
You won't be able to stop marching and saluting.
There's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's
voice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?
I do, Sister.
Do you hear me, Francis?
I do, Sister.
You could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You
could be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.
She comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.
She leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.
She plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.
Mam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my
brothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.
Patricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.
Oh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.
Ah, God, don't do that, nurse.
Very well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.
When she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.
The book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.
I do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.
The history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.
Patricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.
Patricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.
He'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,
A coat of the claret velvet,
and breeches of brown doe skin,
They fitted with never a wrinkle,
his boots were up to the thigh.
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle,
His pistol butts a-twinkle,
His rapier hilt a-twinkle,
under the jewelled sky.
Every day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.
I'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.
Ah, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.
He bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's
your English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.
Sister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life
of a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.
The Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.
There are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.
Seamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.
She shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.
Nurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.
The nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.
He knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.
It wasn't, Seamus.
I know and didn't I tell her that.
Patricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all
their perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know
means and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the
do it must be terrible.
He comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.
The July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.
No, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.
I practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.
Seamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!
Her eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.
He hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.
Blood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on
about
what it
English
the highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.
Seamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.
The girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.
Seamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.
I can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.
I can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.
It's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.
I'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.
She won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.
Mam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.
After fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.
People are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?
It's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.
Mam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.
I lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.
When Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.
I don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.
Wodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.
I can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.
We walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.
Mam says, It won't kill you.
She doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.
Then a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.
I know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?
I have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He
dictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.
Dad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.
The next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.
The name of my composition is-
The title, McCourt, the title.
The title of my composition is, ""Jesus and the Weather. ""
What?
""Jesus and the Weather. ""
All right, read it.
This is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would
have liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.
Anytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.
Mr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?
I did, sir.
Did your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.
Come here, McCourt.
I follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?
I did, sir.
I'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.
Mr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?
It's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.
Cruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.
Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.
If they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.
Sir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?
They did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.
Mr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and
bought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.
He calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.
I know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.
When you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.
At night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all
the Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.
I think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.
I feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.
Day and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.
There is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.
Sometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.
The minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can
never rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.
We fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.
The flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.
We can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.
Mam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.
Next year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?
Sister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?
I did, Sister.
And did you receive?
I did, Sister.
She takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that
chair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.
The dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?
Nothing.
Yes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?
I am, Sister.
He's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.
Ah, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.
Do, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?
Indeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.
The girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.
She leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.
and I tells
I am.
Well, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.
Surely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home
wonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway
me Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get
home my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.
It's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.
It's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?
Sick horse, son. Go home.
The stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.
Michael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.
The stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.
Michael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.
One of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.
The men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.
No rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.
Ye are destroyin' that horse.
Can't ye have respect for the dead?
Go easy with that poor horse.
The stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'
about? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.
IX
Mam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.
Dad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.
Mam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.
What is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.
Families up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.
Some families sing,
Yip aye aidy aye ay aye oh
Yip aye aidy aye ay,
We don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.
If there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.
The families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.
Sean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.
Brendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.
At times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.
Dad says a factory is no place for a woman.
Mam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have
electricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?
He says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?
I do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.
He sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.
We're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.
An egg.
Mam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.
It's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her
bread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.
There are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.
Prams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.
The men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.
They laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.
In the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.
The women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.
I look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?
Some men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.
The men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.
The train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station
steps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.
Dry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?
Dad, Dad, don't go, Dad.
Tommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and
bones.
Peter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,
God help us.
Larry, mind them bloody bombs.
Christy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of
diseases.
Jackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,
Jack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.
Dad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,
above all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.
Back at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.
We sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.
Surely.
Mam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?
All we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.
Bridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.
We know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes
is a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.
We see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.
The families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.
There are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.
Everyone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.
Telegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.
Aw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?
I know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.
The children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.
Once the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.
Mr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.
Mam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says
don't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.
You don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.
There's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.
She's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.
What's that? says Mam.
Your fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in
it.
But I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before
she stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.
I think they're getting better.
That's good, and she goes back to bed.
The eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the
poor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.
There are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.
Mr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.
And what's up with you?
'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.
Oh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?
'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.
All right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.
Two long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?
My son. The eyes.
Ah, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.
'Tis an infection, missus.
Sure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.
What's that now?
Babies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.
And where would I get a caul?
Don't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.
Mam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.
Dr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him
in.
What does he have, Doctor?
The worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and
something else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.
How long will he be in, Doctor?
Only God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with
bandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.
In the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.
The whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.
I try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.
I have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you
might be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?
I have an infection, Seamus.
Yerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.
I want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket
and says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.
Mam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.
Mr. Timoney.
Who is it? Who do we have?
Frank McCourt, sir.
Francis, ah, Francis.
Mam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.
Well, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin
nor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?
I have an infection in my eyes.
Ah, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,
you're too young for that.
Mr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?
With them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond
reading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?
Mam says, Terrible world but God is good.
Indeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?
We did, Mr. Timoney.
Mam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.
Seamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.
I'm sorry, Seamus.
I have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.
I won't, Seamus.
He says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.
They took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.
The Owl looked up to the stars above,
And sang to a small guitar,
O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,
What a beautiful Pussy you are,
You are,
You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
They say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.
What a beautiful Pussy you are.
Then Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.
Good-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.
I want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.
I'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.
Mr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in
a pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.
Mam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.
No, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.
Mam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.
She knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.
There is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled
against the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.
Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.
Then Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your
name?
Timothy Creagh, sir.
Creagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.
I do, sir. Indeed I do.
And what do you want, Creagh?
Ah, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd
like to see Dr. Feeley.
Well, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that
are going against your stomach.
Ah, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the
pains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to
the people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?
And the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead
and Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.
The public assistance, is
'Tis, Mr. Kane.
And where's your husband?
Oh, he's in England, but-
England, is it? And where
that what you want, woman, the relief?
is the weekly telegram, the big five
pounds?
He didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.
Is that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men
of Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?
He looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.
Mam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?
Oh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.
I want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're
taking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.
Oh, yes, Mr. Kane.
And what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
That's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.
He's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from
the Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.
Why don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?
I don't know, sir.
You don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.
He looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.
He whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.
We follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.
X
It's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.
The bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.
We sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at
O'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.
Still, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.
I put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.
I try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.
Lemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.
There's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.
My brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.
We put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.
Roddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.
Alphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.
The three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.
There's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.
Mam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.
I have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.
There's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.
Malachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.
Mam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from
olden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.
We push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.
We collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.
When we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.
Malachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.
Malachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.
There's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?
Michael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.
He won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.
Where's your father?
He's in England.
Well, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.
You can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.
It might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.
He pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?
I tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.
They scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.
They push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.
Grandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?
My mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.
She wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.
Guard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.
The doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.
I tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.
Get your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.
She finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.
Grandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.
When you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by
the range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.
We're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.
She gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?
Michael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?
Pneumonia, says Malachy.
Well, now, that's better than oldmonia.
We don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.
He sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.
She calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your
aunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.
Aunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.
The alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.
Her backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.
The streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.
The church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.
Aunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.
I don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?
She cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.
After school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.
I don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.
There are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.
Before Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.
I could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.
Aunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.
I want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.
There are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.
We don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.
You can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.
Grandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.
Malachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.
Next day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?
We are, son.
Alphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.
Malachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.
Mam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.
In a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Café with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.
The next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the
jam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.
She says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.
We play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.
Malachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.
There in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.
This is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.
My mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.
The door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.
I don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.
Mam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from
Kathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.
It isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.
There's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.
XI
Mam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.
All she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.
I don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.
I remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.
The dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.
I'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
Billy says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.
We have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up
kicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.
Malachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.
Peter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.
Mikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.
Peter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.
The pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.
Peter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.
I tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.
Naw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.
You don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.
I'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the
nine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?
What's what?
Conceived.
That's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are
nine months later.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't
like the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.
I'm not an egg.
You are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.
Why am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.
All bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.
They're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.
What am I going to do?
Nothing. You're doomed.
Can't I light a candle or something.
You could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.
But I don't have a penny for the candle.
All right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you
get a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.
The barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?
Retreat, says Peter.
That's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.
What's up with you, Peter? says the barman.
What was that you said before, Tommy?
Everything has an opposite.
Mother o' God.
Are you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?
The pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint
drinkers, amn't I?
Begod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.
That means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?
I could be the champion of no pints at all.
Ah, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all
right at home?
Tommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at
all.
Peter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to
your mother, Mikey.
You didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.
You're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints
for me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know
what 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.
Peter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.
A penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his
excitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.
Saturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.
There are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.
We walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.
Mam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.
Mam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?
Mam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.
Mam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.
Mam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.
Mam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.
Bridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?
'Tis, Bridey.
I'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.
I'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.
Men are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.
First we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.
That makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.
There are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in
the shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.
When the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.
We cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.
We have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?
The bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.
The horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.
The streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans
on the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.
I'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?
Uncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.
Uncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?
I was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.
Your eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
Wash them when you go home.
I will, Uncle Pa.
Mr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my
morning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.
On the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.
People on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?
They're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.
Mam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.
She heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.
I want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.
You can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.
I want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.
She comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?
The blinking.
Blinking is not exercise.
Seamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.
Mam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.
Blinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing
Jap.
I don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are
clearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.
He hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.
Surely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.
The horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking
like the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.
I work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.
Mr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.
They don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.
Then there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.
There are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.
The legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.
The neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.
I wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them
on to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.
I wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.
Mam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.
My face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.
Mam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.
She says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.
And I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?
Mam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.
She washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.
I don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.
Monday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor
about his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.
The man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?
McCourt, sir.
Tell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand
that?
I do, sir.
The doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.
In a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?
Oh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.
She smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.
He shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.
Did you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?
I didn't, Mrs. Hannon.
You were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,
the nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.
I feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.
I think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.
Like a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.
I won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.
You have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.
That's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.
You'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.
Hannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.
Can I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?
They might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.
Mam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.
XII
There's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.
Mam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.
Now it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.
We're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.
Mam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.
He says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.
He takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.
He hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.
I have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.
Lights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.
Thank you very much and Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.
Thank you very much, sir.
We wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.
There is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.
He's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.
Don't talk about your father like that.
I say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.
Next day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?
Och, no, Angela.
Michael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.
Oh, I do.
He takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.
She opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are
gone.
Could you spare it? she says.
She shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have
chocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.
Mam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,
jobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
You drank the money, Dad.
We're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,
now boys. Respect for your father.
He puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man
but don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.
He comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.
We have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.
Dad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.
He tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.
Mam says, Where are you going?
London.
On this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?
It's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give
the workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.
And how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?
The way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.
He kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it
Frank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.
Malachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?
Mam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.
Michael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?
'Twill.
Will it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?
The two eyes, I think.
Malachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.
Dad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,
goes out the door and pulls it shut.
Mam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will
this rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.
The rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.
We go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.
You never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.
Michael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells
Michael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.
The lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.
The lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.
We all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.
Michael cries.
Grandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?
Sunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.
One night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.
Ah, no, Kathleen. It's all right.
No. Come in.
They give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry
jam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?
I love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.
Oh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.
I don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.
When the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in cafés, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.
Mrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.
After the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,
oh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.
Oh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.
And Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?
What, Mrs. Purcell?
That Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks
behind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.
Mam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.
Oh, we'd never touch the beams.
She goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.
We run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.
Mam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.
She's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?
Grandma says, What room?
I rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?
There were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened
to the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?
Grandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?
Ye don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.
Mam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?
Michael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this
takes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?
Mam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.
No lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.
He goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.
She tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.
She pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.
Grandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?
How would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.
She pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.
What? What? What? What?
There's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till
they get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
He hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.
Grandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.
Grandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.
Mam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.
Once we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.
Malachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.
But I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.
It's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.
We can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.
Michael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.
Mam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.
There's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is
disgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.
Mam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.
There are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.
There are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.
Mam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.
Mam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.
We work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.
Laman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.
When we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.
Laman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.
The librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.
She picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate
places. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.
Laman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.
Mam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.
Grandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.
Her oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.
His wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.
The Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.
Now I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.
XIII
Boys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.
The best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.
Of course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?
'Tis.
And I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do
you?
I don't.
And you'd like to help your mother?
I would.
Well, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want
you to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.
I don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.
Laman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.
It's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.
There are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.
I have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.
Now I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that
word and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.
All I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.
All these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.
Hoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.
There are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.
If we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.
He sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.
In seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks
and the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.
Beside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule
The village master taught his little school.
A man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.
Full well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.
Full well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.
Full well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.
He always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.
The village all declared how much he knew.
'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.
In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.
We know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.
I think it's shining, sir.
Pithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.
Clarke is pithy but adequate, sir.
Adroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.
I will, sir.
Tell your mother come and see me.
I will, sir.
Mam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a
decent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.
Well, ask him.
I can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.
She comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the
messenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.
He tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.
Mam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.
I wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.
A few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.
She knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?
Mam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?
We don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.
Mam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?
I am.
That's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.
Is it? I don't remember.
Stephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?
I do.
And now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.
Her face tightens and she's angry. You are never to
be an altar boy
let anybody
slam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?
She starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the
world to be a family of messenger boys.
I don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to
stay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.
I'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.
Mr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.
You must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?
I do, sir.
Priests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
I ask for the application.
I will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?
That's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.
Oh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?
Trains?
No. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?
It has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean
disposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?
In the Sahara?
No, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?
Thirteen.
Go home to your mother.
It's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in
Roden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.
Mam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.
He's only twelve and he doesn't understand.
I'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.
I know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be
a sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.
One Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.
And why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.
I can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.
The priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.
And what have you done since then, my child?
I hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.
Yes, my child, and what else?
I – I - I did dirty things, Father.
Ah, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?
Some class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.
The night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.
When Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.
Did you empty the chamber pot today?
Oh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.
He shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the
bike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.
You will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?
Mam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.
Well, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.
But he couldn't do it, says Mam.
He tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.
Shut up and go to bed.
You can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised
me.
I'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get
up from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.
He pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby
eyes.
I won't. You promised me.
He punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My
mother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.
I'll kill you, you little shit.
Mam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.
I hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.
He says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.
I can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.
In awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.
I leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Café. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.
The streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the café he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.
He's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?
I tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.
He says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.
I wonder what I'll do tomorrow.
XIV
In the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.
It's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.
Mam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?
No.
Ah, do, Frankie. Come on.
I live here now. I'm never going back.
But Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big
brother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.
I can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.
His eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain
in my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.
There's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.
He complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.
I get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.
Sometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.
That's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.
Still, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.
I wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.
Doom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.
I walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a
castle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.
Might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.
Some houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.
Beyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.
I bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.
Oush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.
And Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.
Out beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.
The Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.
I always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't
eat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.
That's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.
Michael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.
There's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.
She's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.
I'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.
The paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.
Adultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing ""The Road to Rasheen. "" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.
I can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.
Miss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?
Thanks, Miss O'Riordan.
I'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.
Then there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.
St. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.
The priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.
Virgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.
How is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?
I like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.
I could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have
everyone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.
Still, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Yütang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.
Turgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.
My father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.
Miss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.
And what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.
She picks up Lin Yütang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.
Mother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.
Well, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.
Oh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.
But I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.
Out or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Yütang, indeed. Out.
There's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Yütang.
The People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.
The day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'
decency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.
I have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?
I have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.
I can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.
He hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.
I chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.
I look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.
The sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in
the wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.
The worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?
That's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.
What big job?
Telegram boy at the post office.
She says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be
in a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.
The next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the
kettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.
Now Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets
a bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.
By the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?
I can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.
Well, she says, that's more than your father would do.
XV
It's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.
He can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.
I bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.
On my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?
Nine.
All right.
She turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She
doesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.
Why do I have to be an hour late?
Do what you're bloody well told.
There are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are
two women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.
What kind of work would that be now?
Telegram boy, miss.
The thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the
lavatories.
No, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and
there's supposed to be a job.
Oh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?
I do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.
Isn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the
thin woman.
Your job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.
The telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.
Aunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.
Carbolic soap.
They smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.
She takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.
I turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.
Monday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.
Mrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.
I'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.
Temporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.
Mrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address
first, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.
One telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.
Is that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.
She's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.
Tongue?
Dennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?
What tongue? says I.
The tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.
So up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.
Back I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him
making a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.
She shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.
Mrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?
She's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.
No, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.
I will, Mrs. Clohessy.
Do.
***
At the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of
my life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.
It's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.
Michael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Café and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing
and dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.
There are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.
People in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.
The best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.
Protestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.
The Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.
The worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.
When you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.
Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.
A fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.
But Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.
What are you supposed to do?
You're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.
I want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.
Mrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle
over the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?
I want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.
I can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.
That's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.
The telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil
a potato for
bread, bring
O'Connor the
some soap so
grateful and
my troubles.
her, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of
her a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever
say a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all
Ah, no thanks, ma'am.
Take the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.
I couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.
Take the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver
my telegram anymore.
Oh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.
Good night, son. Be good to your mother.
Good night, Mrs. Daly.
School starts in September and some days Michael stops at The
Abbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,
Can I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.
When Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.
The Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.
Malachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"" and the Abbot sings ""The Road to Rasheen"" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.
There are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.
The boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.
There is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?
I said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.
I'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear
me?
I did, Miss Barry.
You have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.
Shut up, Mackey.
I will, Miss Barry.
Not another word, Mackey.
No, Miss Barry.
I said shut up, Mackey.
All right, Miss Barry.
That's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.
Mother o' God give me patience.
Yes, Miss Barry.
Take the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.
I will, Miss Barry.
Toby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film
called The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.
Toby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.
Toby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.
Mrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.
When I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.
The boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.
I cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.
I skidded on my bike.
Come in and I'll put something on your cuts.
I wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.
She puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?
Ah, no.
Ah, do.
I will.
I drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam
rise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.
There she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.
She puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.
We take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.
What's up with you?
I think it's because it's the first time.
I tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and
splash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.
I thought you were cut.
For weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.
One Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?
Yes, she's in the hospital.
Is she in the sanatorium?
I said she's in the hospital.
She's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she
doesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the
sanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.
The next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.
I slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.
Next day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.
On Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.
I want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.
Frost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.
It's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.
XVI
Mrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a
dry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.
This isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?
Irish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.
You'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.
He leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.
This is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?
Ah, a lemonade will be lovely.
I am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.
I gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.
I'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.
I - I, -
Oi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.
I was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.
Heaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.
Ah, no, thanks.
Ah, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.
Ah, no thanks.
Ah, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it
into my mouth.
He collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest
a moment.
My stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and
throw up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.
You, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the
window, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?
He pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.
I climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.
I was, I was,
You was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.
He made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.
Made you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.
But I need the job. I have to save and go to America.
America. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.
I hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and
throw a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.
Mam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.
She gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll
let me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.
Every Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.
I'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.
Theresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.
I look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.
I'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.
The priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.
I cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.
I swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.
I still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.
There's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?
Fifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.
Young enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?
I can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.
Arrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?
I can.
She wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.
I'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.
Mrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?
Oh, I will.
From now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.
In a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.
My first letter,
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.
I remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?
I think it means this is your last chance.
I write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.
I run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.
The next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.
Week after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.
Dear Mrs. O'Brien,
Inasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.
Next week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.
On Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.
She rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.
Sometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.
Often I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.
My mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.
I'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.

Some of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.
Mam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.
I'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?
Lemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.
You'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.
Don't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your
father but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.
I will, Uncle Pa.
I hear you're taking that exam for the post office?
I am.
Why would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a
postman in no time and it has the pension.
Ah, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the
pension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?
I do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.
What did he say?
Make up your own mind.
True for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions
and to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?
I will, Uncle Pa.
The day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.
I stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.
The man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?
I want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.
The manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.
I write,
Frank McCourt,
4 Little Barrington Street,
Limerick City,
County Limerick,
Ireland
I am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.
What's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?
I don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.
Little Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.
They call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.
Don't be getting above yourself, boy.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
You live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do
you understand that, McCourt?
I do, sir.
You have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.
You have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.
Oh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.
Then there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
You can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?
I can, Mr. McCaffrey.
Well, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to
ring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.
In the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?
No, Mr. McCaffrey.
Another thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
No IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?
I do, Mr. McCaffrey.
Mrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.
True for you, says Miss Barry.
Too good for us, I suppose.
True for you.
Do you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?
Oh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.
Did you hear that, Miss Barry?
I did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.
He spoke.
He did, indeed.
He will rue the day, Miss Barry.
Rue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.
Mrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for
their telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.
I don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.
And who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?
He is, Mrs. O'Connell.
And after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?
We do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.
She whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.
A disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.
She keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.
Going to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.
Miss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?
He is, Miss Barry.
I don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I
say I'm sorry? Good-bye?
I lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,
Go on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.
They're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.
XVII
I don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?
Mrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.
She must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.
A person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.
The barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.
And what is it you'd like? says the barman.
I'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.
Oh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure
there's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?
There isn't, sir.
Uncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.
The men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.
I tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.
The men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.
Uncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about
concentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.
Uncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.
All right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.
He says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.
Ah, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.
He closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but
I'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.
He says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.
Jesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.
I'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.
It's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.
Your Uncle Pa should know better.
I stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.
She turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.
Did you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.
Mind your own bloody tongue.
Don't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.
I'll talk to you any bloody way I like.
You have a mouth like a messenger boy.
Do I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of
Laman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.
She walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,
Laman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.
I fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.
In the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?
No.
'Tis your birthday.
I don't care.
She calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your
stomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.
I have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.
I begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.
I'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.
St. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.
There is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.
My child, my child, my child.
I'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.
My child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.
I'm sixteen today, Father.
Oh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?
I drank my first pint last night.
Yes? I hit my mother.
God help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything
else?
I can't tell you, Father.
Would you like to go to confession?
I can't, Father. I did terrible things.
God forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die
for us.
I can't tell, Father. I can't.
But you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?
He doesn't help me anymore.
But you love him, don't you?
I do. My name is Francis.
Then tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that
trouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?
I talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.
Father Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?
His brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.
But I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.
No, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.
Are you sure, Father?
I am, my child.
He blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy
trotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.
Monday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.
Mr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.
When I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.
They laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.
Eamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.
I'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.
Mr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a
bit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.
Gerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.
Gerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.
The train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?
'Twas.
Where is he?
Oh, he went out.
I know he went out. Where did he go?
I don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.
Didn't say anything?
I didn't hear him say anything.
Do you work with him?
I do. I'm taking over the bike.
What bike?
The messenger bike.
Is he on a messenger bike?
He is.
He told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?
I feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to
get him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.
Well, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.
I have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.
We walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.
I turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.
I didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.
I won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.
Oh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?
No, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?
She told me.
She did?
She did, honest to God.
Jasus.
He bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,
Of course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.
Mr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.
Every shop, Mr. McCaffrey?
I'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.
I'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.
Why?
We can sell 'em, me an' Peter.
Why?
'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.
What's birth control?
Aw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,
rubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.
Up the pole?
Pregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.
I'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.
What about Peter?
Leave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you
do ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.
Mr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.
Mr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?
What filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.
Ma'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.
What filth?
Can't tell you. Come on, boys.
We throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey
is in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.
The biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?
Some shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?
He demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.
On the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through
shops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.
Monday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.
Eamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.
Five shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.
Some people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.
Malachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.
She looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.
She gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love
the bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.
She says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.
Chamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?
Of course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.
He's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?
I do, Mr. Sliney.
Ah. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?
I did, Mr. Sliney.
He's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.
I will, Mr. Sliney.
I'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?
I am, Mr. Sliney.
Is he listening to me, missus?
Oh, he is, Mr. Sliney.
Good. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can
whisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.
***
Halvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.
Every day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?
There are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.
I keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not
coughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.
I read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.
Peter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.
Eamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.
Dear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.
Dear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.
In the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.
Malachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.
XVIII
I'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should
have over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.
She sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.
I'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.
The Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.
I sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.
Another sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.
The man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?
I do.
I tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?
We will.
Alphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?
Michael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.
Alphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?
Mam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this
life. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.
On my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.
I want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.
Now there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.
Mam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.
He sings ""The Road to Rasheen. "" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?
I don't know.
The Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.
Uncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.
Come on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice
only.
All right. I'll try.
We all join in the chorus of her sad song,
A mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,
You'll miss her when she's gone.
Uncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.
Oh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.
We stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.
No, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.
Oh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.
Mam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.
It's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.
Surely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.
It's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.
He's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.
The priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.
Three days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.
Three American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?
The day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.
The Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.
The priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.
I'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.
The Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?
The man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.
Oh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.
Is that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.
He climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.
The captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.
After dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.
He invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.
The priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.
Pawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.
Tim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.
The priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.
The bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?
Frank McCourt.
Nice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?
Yes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.
The priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.
The what?
Lavatory.
Oh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.
She pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and
whispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.
I stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at
a time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.
I finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.
Frieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.
The First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.
The bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and
falls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.
We climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.
We watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.
I stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?

161,Where Do We Go From Here,"[Verse 1]
I already know that I’m an asshole
Gotta be careful about the shit that you say cuz you always gonna get what you ask for (what you ask for)
Steppin' outside through the backdoor
I remember scoopin’ you in the black ford
Now you’re worldwide got stamps on the passport
You the whole reason that I rap more
Got me goin’ crazy in the booth babe
Ridin’ solo in the city
All the bad things that I done tryin’ to forget about your name
Man I pray the lord forgive me
I’m startin’ up the hemi
Bad bitches man I know plenty
Rich guys bet you know plenty
But women like you and guys like me
Besides the two of us I don’t think I  know any

[Hook]
And I know I said some fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Know I put it all in your face
When you ain't’ wanna see those thangs
Now you got me all at the house
Startin’ to make me so strange
I know I know I said a lot of fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Where do we go from here (x3)
Where do we go (x2)
Where do we go from here
I know I put it all in your face
When you ain’t wanna see those thangs

[Verse 2]
Already know that I’m an asshole
Always said that you wanna be free
And you always gonna get what you ask for
In and out of the terminal tryin’ to find ya
Maybe you just needed a reminder
Yeah I know you love sex but doggy style ain’t the only time you gonna need someone behind ya
Yeah girl and you be
You be playin’ my emotions
Tell me not to call you or  text you or tweet you
The next day the call lines open (what the fuck)
I made a plan put it into motion
You made a plan for crossing over oceans
I was sour about it like the shit I’m smokin’
But I had to let you go to show you my devotion

[Hook]
Yeah And I know I said some fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Know I put it all in your face
When you ain't’ wanna see those thangs
Now you got me locked in the house
Startin’ to make me so strange
I know I know I said a lot of fuck shit
But I didn’t mean those thangs
Where do we go from here (x3)
Where do we go (x2)
Where do we go from here
Cuz I didn’t mean those thangs (x2)
Girl, you know, I didn't’ mean those thangs (x2)

164,As Long As It Matters,"How can I find something
That two can take
Without stumbling as we
Walk into our future's wake

That you can play
Repeating as if it matters
Everything I want to say

I'll be all right
As long as it matters
As long as you're here with me now

Forget that time
It's nothing we touch and see
All this is fine
Even as it crashes down on me
I'm looking around
There's nothing that I could want
More than to tell you
There's no more than we've already got

Everything so much

I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain

Facing the wind
Tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been
When I was hoping
Was waiting for you
To pull back the door
To take me by the hand
And lead me through

This whole world was
A stranger to me
Now you have opened
My heart to everything

Good afternoon, i could help but noticing you smiling as i was passing through
I got a couple things that i have to do
But after that maybe we can get a bite up on the avenue
Oh, you got a man? Well i ain't mad at you
Just hit me up
If you need a pick me up
When he gets mad you again over some dumb shit; disgusting
How you give your all to someone give you nothing
I could give you the world full of my love inside
So is you down to ride?
I know my feelings are deep but baby take a dive
Only way to the top is if we take the sky right?

[Chorus]
I know we been so close and I'm just asking if you feel me
This love's deeper than a vein full of dope, can you feel me?

I think she loves me, but she keep lyin'
Try to get the truth but its harder when she hide
And deep down inside i can help but think she trifling
Hoes turn into house wives now everybody wifing
Don't you know she gonna keep playing you? homie, you better keep your options open/
Before that cold-hearted bitch leave you frozen
And now you stuck
You should of fucked got your nut gave her to boot like a punt
But, things don't always happen the way you plan it
I went from falling then i face plated
I got these feelings i can't fake and i can't stand it
God gave us the world and shorty make me wanna make planets
She said I'm talking out my ass i say Uranus
We start to laugh, we kiss begin this love making
Its bad we gotta keep this on the low
So tell me one thing baby i need know

170,Just Because I Love You,"I got no hidden agenda here inside
Couldn't stop these emotions if I tried
You're all I wanna do
I got something here waiting just for you

Deep in my heart
That's where you shine
Give you my best all of the time
For no other reason, no other rhyme, baby

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that

Just because I love you
I really do

Alone
Some things I do with only you alone
You drive me to a place I've never known
It intensifies

Every second you're not here to satisfy
All of my wants, all of my needs
Comes with your touch
So good for me
That's why I'm here and always will be

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that

You make it easy
Just by being here
You free me, baby
You must be doing something right
All of my feelings
They just keep on getting deeper, baby
There's no end in sight

Deep in my heart, that's where you shine
Give you my best, all of the time
For no other reason, no other rhyme

Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Like the moon and stars
It's a natural fact

Just because I love you
Just because I love you
Don't need to second guess
It's as simple as that

171,Children,"[Verse 1]
I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

172,"Touch Me Tease Me (From ""The Nutty Professor"")","[Round 1: Aye Verb]
Have y'all ever heard a record one time and knew that y'all hated it and despised it?
But after the radio played it a 100 times you start to- you start to sing along wit' it and kinda like it?
I did some research, one defect with the human mind is
Any brain can be programmed as long as you put that time in
See URL tightly watches this culture and checks the climate
The algorithms, for those that don't know what them squiggly lines is, it's simple
For every dollar made, DNA deserves like five of 'em
He deserves a bonus from this culture for the services he provided
Now let me break this down
If the workin' man workin' all day and street niggas dyin'
That mean the nerds bringin' in all these views and all these ""likes"" then
This a business and in every business the customer right, yeah?
Gotta serve the geeks a face they relate to that's kinda like them
Him right here
So they download and they spam this virus to every household and hand devices
So roses can't grow from concrete but dandelions look dangerous in the den of lions
This man inspires geeks and nerds who come from silver spoon houses with cans of cider that they can be liars
Come to battle rap and talk killin' and cannon fire
And it's cool cause it's only just rap when that camera's by him
You can't time my rounds my raps timeless
Call for Smack to call ""time"" I'ma cover Smack mouth then my hand rises
One of my OG's was a buy the boatload tan buyer
Taught me ""money don't make the man, cause if he makin' money he's gonna look like the man
You tell how real a nigga is by the jewelry of the niggas that stand beside him.""
Oh boy, this ain't no spar with the blogs this man writin'
In yo' blogs you channel Tyson but yo' stance in the ring like a damn Irish
Ain't nan like him, you're now facin' the Island God
At best you slightly levitate
Bitch I land gods
I'm throwin' punches, stay focused where your eyes land god
When I miss I barely miss, but when I land...gawd!
Dawg, this the blueprint of a failures design
You a grown man and most  yo' fans be in bed before 9:00
You for the picked on, and niggas who show no signs of that get down
Your fans don't fuck wit' Verb cause shiiit I remind them of the niggas they couldn't sit 'round
I can't believe it
How y'all clap for all this cap' of Eric cappin' people
He for the average I'm for the master thinkers and avid readers
When I hear you rap I break out in like Cabin Fever
Thank me niggas, Mook and Lux made sure none of y'all could pop so the (soda)
St. Louis nigga came and capped y'all leaders (liters)
Hop in this backyard Beavis
And get beat and get a cracked jaw leavin'
Fuck yo' fans, I don't rap for them people
My fans street
When I flow they bow they heads and wave they [?] side to side
Close they eyes and try vibe while they trap phones ringin'
My shit church, this ain't my accent speakin'
Tell DNA tonight he play he Curry, 30 y'all in his backbone region
That's a body in the morgue with more victims
Not here to toy with your punches, personals, I'ma take you all around lil' nigga, I'm 'bout to tour witchu
A grown man ain't never been threatened by boy whispers
And you still a boy, cause you empty inside cause you been ignored
Buyin' clothes and tryin' to fill yo' lil' pockets won't fill that void
This battle shit be fuckin' wit' my emotions from pain to joy
Cause I can never be y'all #1
But as long can't be Floyd I'm good
Cause in this world though, these type niggas are the kings and pharaohs
Draped in all the fly apparel who wear gold
They sit next to the real extract their souls and put the culture in The Sunken Place
So when the real flow the fans turn heads and cover ear holes
This here though?
Tonight the villain becomes the hero
I'm Aye Verb, the black cloud cardinal cap scare crows for you weirdos
I don't stand on poles I lay in pose, with a tripod, barrel with airholes
Y'all come to this field I wave it and tear holes in their clothes
The warrior
These bars buryin' barbarians
Bald head, bouncin' that body
I'm Strapped In- y'all scary men
I battled K-Shine y'all had to pair it up
Three niggas that wrote for one nigga, okay that's weird to us
But it's cool cause that mean deep down inside you scared of us
I'ma put y'all whole circle in boxes and square this up
To you I suck, cause you can't understand the speech different
Battle rap the only time you been tested lil' geek nigga
I'm from a Crip set but we cool with some Bloods when we see niggas
We head nod 'em and gave 'em dap
And when we pulled our hands back
They still try to test us and try to lock B's wit' us
And that's why my shit way too real for these niggas
Time

[Round 1: DNA]
Yo, this the movie y'all been waitin' for
Get ya popcorn
I do exactly how this gon' go with dirty
And Smack you picked a bad date
Cause I'm takin' out another bitch that don't deserve me
It's always long build ups when Aye MC (AMC)
But since this a battle I picked I owe him 30
Cause it takes a lot to get to where I'm at, and Aye, it's showin' early
This what you call a rapper?
It was writin', you know I'm a lay it down, record it after
Plus you talkin' to D Verb, fix ya vocals
You in the mix before the master
In NWX in the buildin'?
{Crowd cheers}
That's the squad that I'm runnin' wit'
And when the toy lit (toilet) I be dumpin' shits
(Aaah!)
Nah, chill, see he fell for the gas trick (gastrics)
Bypass the shit they pushin', you gon' have to stomach this
I get more lit, more pissed, exhausted from usin' these Dillingers
Now let's see how far the gas get, when a few go up in smoke, I got this covered from all cylinders
Warriors come out and play
Y'all tried to say that I'm wildin'
Jurassic Park, you made a mistake with DNA on the Island
Then this happened, I'ma skip past him
I started off with a buck 50, but now I'm zig zaggin'
A big stabbin', the shit gashin'
I'm raisin' a gem to get Aye (ay) at the end; Pig Latin
And I'ma cripple him here
Greg Odin, when these (knees) snap I'm finna end ya career
My vision is clear when the pistol is near
To get a nigga from the Lou' to (Luda) shake assault (a salt) from the pump; Chicken & Beer
Aye King Los, I'm hopin' you watch this
One swing gon' smoke ya accomplice
But you gon' get double, Aye (A)
And they gon' charge D battery; there ain't a volt that can stop this
I'm so live with this, ya whole vibe suspicious
We heard your slogan before now it's yo' time to witness
I hold mine from distance, Aye, bro mind ya business
But if I drift, pull Aye over; roadside assistance
Soon as these niggas get on fire they start feelin' themselves
Switchin' up they drivers
Outta nowhere, Aye get the TEC's (text): Pretty Little Liars
I'm the king, don't touch my crown
GOATs? I wouldn't spit Mook and Lux my rounds
I seen Stranger Things, to them he (demi) god, y'all got this shit Upside Down
Them two debatables had a part of me surprised
Now I'm startin' your demise
Ding and the target has arrived
If I'd have had Mook it would've been Murder (Murda) In The First, masked up with the revolver on the side
Then it's The Jeffersons, I'm 'Moving On Up', to Lux (deluxe) apartment in disguise (the skies)
Tell ya niggas amp you up, but stay the fuck out my face
Cause I don't beat around the bush, with the razor I'ma cut to the chase
Don't take it past battle rap or you'll get rushed in his place
Shit ain't fishin', it's a lot me and Verb'll (verbal) exchange, but this ain't up for debate
I ain't tryin' to reel you in with those lines
But I get the strap I'ma go Shine
Trust me - if you give me the .8 (mediate); I'm takin' both sides
You said, you got molested as a kid by your nanny
So I'm guessin' you the victim
Mad cause an older lady gave you head, that's the moment I grew suspicious
Like, ""Dude is trippin'.""
20/20, ratchet in a new position
So yeah, the baby sittin' different, now you under my supervision
When I first had a gun I ain't know how to shoot it at first
But now if his green round I blew (blue) 30 and that's just a few of the perks (purps)
You ever watch the cartoon The Underdog?
Well what I'ma do to him is worse
Cause havin' you in the ring gon' get you (U) on a shirt
It's no place in my heart, the flow break him apart
It's no games, a cold case will have him road rage from the start
You write poems, I write omens, this is Satan's remarks
A lot of cases, bottle waitress, I rose Aye (rose) with the sparks
And your real name is Chaz Duncan
So in this next round it's gonna hurt you more
Cause the five tends (tens) to hold him up; perfect score
You gon' get a concussion when these triggers is bustin'
I'm talkin' Vince Carter with his arm in the ring, I've got a .50 for Duncan (dunkin')

[Round 2: Aye Verb]
You think I can't rebuttal?
What the fuck? Whoever said that holmes?
Watch this
That last round you said...ahh DNA
For your opponents to flip yo' shit, first we gotta remember it
And that shit you spit don't stay in real niggas heads that long
You need these people's love to feel accepted
When you get rejected you hurl
I don't need they love
My mama ain't hug me in 20 years, bitch I don't come from your world
Nigga no mark, I don't gotta kill you talkin' 'bout chrome sparks
This dope art
I compose like Mozart with this big bro talk
Let me holla at Rain, nigga this yo' fault
We ain't teach yo' lil' lame ass homie 'bout how these holes are
You ain't teach 'em how to recognize game and what the codes are
You ain't tell him in real life, princess don't kiss toad's boy?
Look, it's very basic to see, you got finesse
That bitch you pick look just okay and still she way outta yo' league
You got setup Mr. Punchline my yo' son Shine (sunshine)
Cause you in it, you can't see what's goin' on on the outside
Son blind, you be postin' to other kids like they yours givin' us son shines
But she ain't never posted you and told you ""thank you"", not one time
That's why these goofies can't stand in my presence
Y'all are boys that rhyme words I'm a man with a message
And nigga this talk? You gotta go through it
This shit don't get taught
This when y'all nerd king get his Gucci jacket ripped off
Nigga save that slick talk, nigga you a quarter brick of sniff salt
You talk fist sparks and how yo' fo' point
But when you hold it you flow wit' it and pose wit' it like it's a pitchfork
Speakin' of pitchfork, this is where it gets dark
Let's enter Hades
Welcome to Hell where yo' sins will not be forgiven baby
And you've been guilty of not being innovative
Fabrication and emulating
Street nigga movements, body language and situations
You not from there
Also you guilty of immigration
Verb, I'm straight to the point
Inspiration that Ginsu gave me
Wilder power, better cover yo' head like a Hindu lady
Y'all some hoes, Khloe, Kylie, Kendall, Casey, morals low
And for the lame y'all morals y'all [?]
Look, I ain't gonna just put a hole in yo' head and leave you vacant
I'ma put some new shit inside ya, update ya and renovate ya
This God's work
The universe picked me I don't how it work
A nigga from the bottom got chosen to walk the higher earth
Where stars can't shine bright next to fireworks, that's how this work
I hate y'all niggas, see how my mind work?
Fuck y'all
We can't have a convo with only kind words
I can't see how Smack find work within this fuckin' Fonzworth
He pay you battle, get on stage and make lines hurt
He paid me to make his property better, I'm doin' floors and layin' lime work, nigga
You know how many punchline guys I hurt?
Y'all lack soul  (sole) like how a Converse fit ya
Take ya tone down, tune up, you ain't shit but a check for Christmas
Question ain't if I can take you, it's will I take you serious
Now let me slow up, cause in life you a portrait of how you grow up
And these spoon fed niggas can't even relate to the kitchen, gettin' a bowl cut
You brought the culture one investor, the nigga got a bag on him
I brought this culture a whole region of rappers and never brag on 'em
Baow
When you young niggas do that swag, what is this thing?
{Verb shakes his hand back and forth}
Looks like a straight nigga turned gay nigga sayin', ""Hi"" after he switch teams
You ever drive while your ride was gettin' swiss cheesed?
Ask Big T, it ain't ""baow"" it's ""POW POW POW bing bing bing""
You make yourself a target for that
Be who you are square nigga, it's a market for that
Every line I write between margin is fact
Bitch I had a rap sheet before I started to rap
But I'm smarter than that
Be yo'self nigga it's way harder to act
From battle rap see I'm sorta detached
Cause all the liars get called ""fire"" and we ignorin' the facts
And Beasley and Smack don't give a fuck as long as them numbers come back
Difference between us?
They delete all your battles, people stop speakin'
No more comments, ""D talk to that nigga"" people stop tweeting
Before I shook this niggas hand I was crackin'
See I don't need, go 'head delete him
I know how to hustle, I'm back to eatin'
Give me a pack and half a season, a king I be back to bein'
Motherfucka

[Round 2; DNA]
Yo, I need everybody to put their ringers on silent
Shit like that be messin' up the vibe
I just got the notification that niggas want smoke
And I never been the type to let a nigga slide
So tell Geechi ""NOME"", tell Ave ""Summer Madness"", I'm ready just to ride
See how y'all change the settings?
Now if anyone else from the Volume butt in (button), I'ma press 'em on the side
I'ma ride
Chaz Duncan, this gon' be ya last match
Blood everywhere, wear a hazmat
You'll think I'm kiddin' (Kid &) Duncan?
Play, I'll stab you 'til the blade brown; I'm a Class Act
His chest is jumpin', EMS is comin'
By the cliff, but if he hang on, I'ma get a TEC (tech') for Duncan (dunkin')
Four minute rounds, they ain't book me for a long time
Nah that's the shit that he do
And it's sweet too
Gay, why would you let the beef brew?
Sooo it's- nah, my flow different
Fuck battle rap, we do home visits
Bones missin', body in a box so long he's switchin' tones in it
You could've died from the X, but K made you a known victim
So in this case, all he seen was Shine; Pulp Fiction
I'ma dome split him
It's gonna be hard to get out this slaughter
I'm on a tear and T know (Tarantino), I shoot 'til the clip outta order
Doctors shakin' tables, tryin' to make him stable
Cause how he gonna Showtime if he hooked up to basic cable?
They won't be investin' after this
Ya tombstone memorial where the casket is
And since it's Showtime it came wit' extra packages
I'm back now, Heckler and ruler; class clown
If the strap 'round, the MAC (Mackk) behind the wheel (Will); Yak Town
And I'm lovin' the 90's; (MAC) Mack Wilds
Take the extra shot and impress the pops, my dad proud
I'm the Midwest rusher, [?]
Boom, you hear that sound before you could ask, ""How?""
So we don't like Shoebox, it's probably cause he wack now
But my aim proper, Weight Watchers I could track Cal'
You want the truth with Mook the proof is ARP could've had you left on the shelf
You got that Lux signin', you ducked Iron and they was the only ones ready to help
Y'all ever watch Poetic Justice?
Well these two clips make him Q-Tip, I hope this lesson is felt
Cause I know why he avoided the Jujube's, everyone gets a shot in the head of themselves
Now Verb, let's break down this thing you call ""wizardry""
Cause you disguised your rhymes to blind the eyes that you incline lyrically
You use poetry tools, metaphors, similes
Alteration, imagery
So the picture you paintin' for the viewer is seen vividly
It's repetition so it gets to me
Rhythm, you catch it instantly
The line breaks, it gets to me
Personification set viciously
It's no hope now, you never been broke down to this degree
And I'ma make the room flip cause you can't be too sick if I got the blueprint on how you lack ability
Aye Verb 101
I need everybody to jot this down
The rhythm is when he looks possessed
With his hands in the air like the cops around
The alteration? ""What's poppin'? I'm in pockets for a profit in the project now.""
The imagery? Rocket sounds, choppers 'round
Bullets playin' Ping Pong with King Kong in a gothic town
The personification? Zombies found, blood baths, watch him drown
His thoughts sickenin', the walls whisperin', I gotchu now
The simile? I'm an Egyptian martyr that rose from Gaddafi's grounds
Usin' all of these words, I'm on to you Verb you can stop it now
You call yourself a ""wizard""?
You should be able to work magic to be the rich guy
You talkin' 'bout my sponsor? Harry Potter make a stick fly
Is y'all trippin'?
The weapon see that this god missin'
I'm talkin' 'bout a Bullet in (and) the Wizard; Rod Strickland
The talk wit' me is different
You can't afford to be the victim
You pick the names, I get you paid, and it's costin' me some chicken
I do this 365, so they offerin' me prison
I got bars like Oz and when I'm clickin' on his heels, it's off to see The Wizard!
We know the truth, you fuckin' fruit
You undercover? A couple wonder
If it wasn't for Mook, you'd still be takin' judged battles losin' to up and comers
If it wasn't for my sponsor, you would've never got Lux this summer
Harry had to invest for you to get the shot, you just look Dumb and Dumber
Fuck your Enterprise and ya starships
Little blades; cigar tip
Heavy metal; guitar lift
Stumblin', puzzled in the small room; Saw 6
I got more clips, scratch the serial off the arm like Auschwitz
And now you seein' your dawg (dog) die in front of the X (ex) Hitman; John Wick

[Round 3: Aye Verb]
I really mean this when I say this
I hope and pray for one day me and you can exchange spaces
Exchange faces
Or even lifestyles like in that movie Trading Places
I'm jealous of you
Cause it's hard to be this, gimme that
To have a peaceful, lame nigga life everyday? I envy that
Example: people gon' cheer for you for no reason
They don't want success for me
Every time I spring forward, some will (summer) hope I fall, I get hated on every season
Ya girl ain't never pressured cause you so fuckin' ugly nobody wants you
So cheatin' is somethin' you won't do
Peep what I go through
When I leave my bitch tell me she love me
I go play ball and miss her call she start textin' me fuck me cause she can't trust me
But I love it
Cause God makes sure His toughest soldiers road be hard
You weak niggas can be gone tomorr'
And for a week only we mourn in sorrow
DNA; niggas with your DNA go to the pen' and become a grown lil' boy
Niggas wit' my DNA? Go to the pen and control the yard
See in front of rookies you appear cold
But not in front of Verb, I'm up here cold
I look the rare niggas look mere mortal in mirror mode
Your talent is Dr. Seuss, that's what we call that bro
It's easy for you to be considered a bar spitter, for you the bar set low
Ayo, it's three minute rounds, they ain't book me for a long time
Preview, 3D....
Damn
(So it's Showtime)
Build yo' confidence, open yo' arms out, boulder somethin'
Have your chest and shoulders touchin' like you big and bold or somethin'
You say I say the least, but I'm the most they quote lil' dummy
I'm cocky, holdin' my belt like cops when approachin' someone
You gotta kill me, so you can advance and stock rise
'Cause cornball rappers couldn't thrive until 'Pac died
Admit defeat (the feet), I stand for somethin', do not lie
So if we lock eyes and my tear (tier) drop I do not cry
Put my heart in my pen I'm done tryin'
I killed the comp' in the combines but the league owners used to turn they head and become blind
I put a hole where your heart lies
Iron Man lets sparks fly but Tony Starks still give a mark vibe outside that Mach 5
It hurts inside ya
God don't fuck witchu, He hurt you patna
He put you where this rap shit started, y'all the first to find it
No matter how many times you go on Funk Flex and wear fake designer
On paper yo' pen never come up; cursive writin'
Brain synthesizin', should I go loud and violent or clip the nozzle?
The kid sleepin', I'll do you a solid and sent it silent
You rap violent, but on the inside you cryin', yo' city dyin'
At a time y'all was Goliath of rhymin'
Let me remind him
You be on stage makin' these ugly ass faces cause you really tryin'
But out-of-towners make y'all defensive linemen look like the Giants
I am big dawg
I take a whole fist full of you fuckin' Shih Tzu's and knock you niggas down like fish food
I'm in a piss mood, I'm wit' war
You gauze your wounds and you keep goin'
When I bleed I just like my sores and I kept goin'
You spit that bull but when that bullshit come you quick run
Where I'm from, we run straight to that bull and we grip horns
I made my crown of prick thorns so I can bleed when we on stage
Bein' a god in the sky way too easy, I miss home
Don't pull up at this door if this core you ain't fit for
You're in (urine) the face of a nigga who from the bottom who wasn't even pissed that he was piss-poor
I'm from that soil, where the crack boil, nobody had so we don't hate
We laugh at you niggas that got spoiled
I connect with people and respect the evils
The higher up I go, I hold the struggle down
I could never fall off cause I never leave 'em
Extremist, I showed this culture I'm past devoted
I took the biggest patnas in URL house and smashed you roaches
I took a walk through the park in the blackest nights
I laid down and let the bears and werewolves take massive bites
I had to stare death in the eyes to enhance my sight
To gain passage rights to slowly drive your hearse through the afterlife with flashing hazard lights
Verb, battlin' dude, that ain't a smart move
Small room, large room, we can dance nigga, I turn 'em all into my ballroom nigga
You think you bigger than what you is, I don't understand it
We battle rappers, the most entertaining people on the planet
See I'm the nigga that put his head in the lion's mouth and I dare it
You gon' always be the clown gettin' shot out that cannon, lil' nigga can it

[Round 3: DNA]
I said, word to Big T
This the round I put a nigga from St. Louis out of misery (Missouri)
Y'all see how I had that doo rag and the hoodie and now I'm just in a tee?
Well that's because I'm the GOAT and you had to go through Mook and Lux to get to me
A lot of people said, ""Verb shouldn't be battlin' DNA""
Even ya clique doubted this
But here's where I sneak a GOAT and get a kick out of it
You battled two washed up nigga
Now before y'all say I'm dumb
Mook and Lux are both legends and in their era they had a crazy run
But Surf is like basketball, cause even though those names weigh a ton
Bill's 11 and Wilt's 100 just don't feel the same as Jordan 6's and Kobe's 81
So fuck Mook, fuck Lux
These the GOATs: Geechi tough tough
Ave and Nitty will leave you punch drunk
Shine'll slide up like a dancer with the nunchucks
Twork will hit you wit' the ""baow"" then the gun butt
Suge with the clutch dunk
Then Hitman {scratches} will remix the body to the dump truck
Surf, Roc, Clips, John John, Ars', we did too much stuff
We put this culture on our back, y'all got me fucked up
When we first started battle rap, you right, we ain't have the same buzz
When I got hot they critiqued me and put me down, I see that's what the fame does
Question my believability
Now it's jokes on how I can't drive and all this fake love
I guess y'all put DNA under the microscope to see what I'm made of
And now I'm here, you gon' understand when this verse done
Fuck drivin', I just got my girl a new whip, and a house
Far as respect, I deserve some
I just had to teach my grandma how to walk again cause she wouldn't let the nurse come
And the only steps bigger than that is my daughter's first one
I'm a king of this shit, I follow no rules
Fuck battle rap, I take care of my family, I'm really makin' GOAT moves
I had to put my dreams on hold, get a gun for protection, you couldn't survive what I go through
And now it's back to it's rightful owner, I gotta stand on my own two
The king is bustin', I'm sprayin' somethin'
What y'all confused?
I told my shooter, ""Aim for Duncan"" but once I show the .9, Verb will (nonverbal) see the signs without sayin' nothin'
You said, ""east coast niggas got ego issues""?
So as far as the hitters there's a lot of niggas I can tell sendin'
Your career I can help end it
So if I have Twork and Ars' assist (Narcissist) am I still self centered?
It's gonna get brutal
I told ya son, ""I killed ya faggot ass pops"" he like, ""Well, what he did to you?""
Well if I carry his body to the grave let's see if this spirit can live through you
You used to be tough, now you feminine
Your heart pumpin' estrogen
Cause with your lifestyle you made up a choice
I just wanna know how you vegan and you can't plant base in ya voice
The Midwest Movement ended cause of your jealousy
Cause when X-Factor got hot we saw the worst out him
You battled him to be part of the equation and that ain't even the first problem
When Calicoe got Lux you came up wit' a new plot, to take dude's spot
So was it worth it dummy? Thinkin' dirty money should come from Shoebox?
And with Hitman we saw all of it end
You got on that stage with rage but now you wanna pretend
You let your jealousy supercede your love, as far as detox I'm supportin' the cleanse
Cause you're right, that's the way you talk to your son, but not the way you talk to a friend
Fuckin' [?], I'm done with that
Yeah you ducked Iron Solomon but it's another situation I gotta touch on that
Let's play Swear To God
Swear to God you ain't tell ARP if Hitman got paid more verse Bill Collector you wouldn't get on it
Enough of that, here's another fact
You know how many times Shine got paid more than me on card?  I told 'em ""Double that""
Big T, Clips, T-Top, ""give 'em another rack""
I'm arguin' on the phone with URL like it's my money Smack
Yeah I freestyle, but I'm not here to rebuttal that
Cause I'll never let this business make me not have my brother's back
But the Jedi Mind Trick is you wore a ""Ball Game"" shirt vs Lux cause the loyalty was 'bout to leave
Never supposed to count ya man's pockets but you found the need
Worried about Gerald while it's (wallet) clear to see that that's out ya league
Night Of Rematches comin' up
My niggas ready and they wildin'
Gilligan, the wrong Skipper had a Professor on the Island
Why you got this hate for me?
The first bomber, you deserve karma, this ain't the place to be
Red Dot over the Island like Pearl Harbour and it's plain (plane) to see (sea)
I do, you did, I've been murderin' SMACK vets
I fight, you fought, that's why you been turnin', you wack since
I bleed, you bled, you ain't learn from the crash test
I do, you- I just put Verb in the past tense

Baka 'di mo alam na hindi na bilang
Sa daliri ang binibining sasaktan ka lang
Kaya easy ka lang, 'wag kang magpakahibang

At my hyperbole
Would send me

Told me to keep two, bring him back eight
And I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three
Do you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?
See Martel Homes, that's my claim to fame
That's where I learned my slickest tricks in the dope-d-game
Like my favorite, I call it ""Lemonhead Delight""
That's when you lick off all the yellow and you sell the white.

That nigga B-I-G will make ya'll niggas believers

Callin' them hoes bitches, and smokin' my weed up
When I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal
Wanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals
Fuckin' around wit hoes, bustin' nuts in they mouths
Kickin' that same southern slang
Lookin' for love off in yo' jaw, ho!

See never did I think when I got grown
That some pee wee sacks had been done took this town
See, life's a bitch, then you figure out
Why you really got dropped in the Dirty South
See in the 3rd grade this is what you told
You was bought, you was sold
Now they sayin' Juice left some heads cracked
I betcha Jed Clampett want his money back
See East Point Atlanta threw this road block
Talkin 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
'Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't yours""
That's when me and Big Slate took an oath and sweared
Never would we talk, never would we tell
So when they pulled up bumpin' ""Rock The Bells""
We took what we want and left them quiet as hell

Bass gets to thumpin' rucas get to pumpin'
Who's that rockin' got the party start jumpin'
Blastin' through hah no need for the booyaa
Right hammer with the one knuckle eye-shot through ya
Step to the crowd, I feel the strain'
Throw chingazos in the mosh pit, feel the pain
So don't get in my way baby
Because the Guero loco came in here to play baby
My shit will pump up this jam hot damn it's the baddest
Tres Delinquentes step into the madness

¿Qué ondas, muchacho? Ahí vienes, te miro
Si me traes bronca me a loco de a tiro
Me paro, te tumbo, no es tu rumbo
Y con el lingo, tal vez te confundo
Oh shit, it's the attack of the five foot ten
The Blaxican once again with the cocked hair pin
As I emerge from the depths of the realm my son
I got the black gat fat track coke and rum
Otra vez ya lo vez and the crew somos tres
One Blaxican on the squad you don't test
Hittin' hard like an Aztec, swift like a Zulu
That's what it's like with a palm shot through you
My mannerism mild still the punks get piled
My number one assassin flips the mad funk styles
Me I play the back role but I'm delinquente
This is how I freak it when I'm speaking to the gente

Get funky, get funky, get funky
Get funky, get funky, get funky

[Verse 3]
Whatcha trucha, calmate escucha
Somos delinquentes tu no quieres lucha
But we freak it this way seguí sendo rey
O.G. freaks the beat the mariachis play
Fade it in with snare from ASR-10
Producer mas mejor it's O.G. Style again
Freak it, bump it, bass out the carro
O.G. he's got more BOOM BOOM than Charo
Third of tres brings cuts to your face bro
Hold down the needle with a penny or a peso

With one turntable and a broken 808

Hi my name is A-F-R-O, what’s up y'all?
I am a literal, lyrical, little nigga with an earful of peer
Mere, sheer into feared cleared middlemen
Flow inactive, coping out with the coke bag
Hold back, flow chance, shows growing in advance
Knowing the fast, blowing the pass, hoping and coping an omen to dance
Flowing and roaming is leaving his hoe with a dope under
Beat too slow with his hands
(Tokyo mobster)
Godzilla rocking, knocking, iller stomping on the killer marker
Fonder stomp McCarthy villain with Islamic scriptures
Twist the picture, rip it, swivel it into slivers
In the image, killing off the minutes
(What the fuck?)
Sipping with your mama, in the office kicking on the liver
Cinnamon bitches driving titty zombies over the city
Posting ovaries, and I’m stirring the soup
First verse earning the loot, earn worse words, you’re a doofus

Roar for raw town, raw pound, show ‘em out
White cheesy people like you full house
Mic seething evil, leaving bleeding sheeple rolling down

Settled in envision listen to ed and minimal

Im Feeling a little bit envy
In the bit ending rhythm is heavy rhythm is ending
Put em in training, lazy raising, amazing ages that Asian faces
Stay’in ya lane in the rapist cave and layin’ in the safe havens
Master us, the hazardous, half-magical, black kid
Stabbed and catapult rap, fashionable
I’m half of animal slash cannibalistic aneurysm
Trapped in the manner of rapping wisdom and I’m manifold
Rakim taught me to grab the microphone and slap the mighty hoes that try to_ pie ya from my snotty nose
I am on the world to save ya, robbing all the virgin players
Rhyming urban betrayers to swerve in layers
Im in the urge for learning that the  maker
Serving a murderous rage  assuring him an burning it with affirmative data
Earning a whip, burning the matches, hah
16 year old kid murdering burdens asserting the damage

Kick you in the head like RA did to Macklemore
Legend never dies stop phasing atta boy that annoyed

And welcome all you danged foreigners from other nations
Dear Lord be with our guests and prepare them
For the butt whopping they are about to receive

The Olympics in Georgia
God you know we?re gonna screw that up
I guarantee you
When they let those doves go at the opening ceremony
There are gonna be guys in the parking lot with shotguns

And we will not have a flame
That big without a pig on it, I guarantee
Some fat guy going
?Danged good barbecue top of them stairs up there
They ain't got no hand rail be careful""

Of all the games that the rednecks play
There?s some crazy events
If you know about the redneck ways
Then it makes perfect sense

Hell the Olympic rings will be five old tires nailed together
See that?s my fear, they?re gonna get the list of events
They gonna have no idea what half this stuff is suppose to be
Like for fencing, they?ll be giving people bailing wire and sheet metal

There probably have to cancel water polo after
The first two or three horses drown
I tell you instead of discus throwing
They?ll be flinging Ford hubcaps

You can?t blame them for the way they are
But you can sit back and grin
'Cause they?ll do something that?s so bizarre
You?ll want to see it again

If you could ever get into their minds
There?s no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

And you know they haven?t even thought about it
But the river they?re having the kayak races
On is the same river they filmed deliverance at

That ought to add a whole degree of difficulty shouldn't it?
'Cause if Ned Batty couldn't make it down
That thing a French man in a pair of biker pants ain't got a chance

Be prepared to watch the wildest show
Making her out in the line
You may not see them bringing home the gold
But they?ll sure make mama proud

If you could ever get inside their minds
There?s no telling what you might find
They just do things in a different way
All the games that the rednecks play

Just call me Katie “Damaged Goods” Tropp
Because my Daddy tried to sell me off at the pawn shop
But they wouldn't give him enough so he said “Aww Fuck!”
“This stupid kid ain't worth shit” so he left me in the dust
Now my mind is fucked and I've been broken ever since
And it can't be fixed this ain't no temporary glitch
So I pick up my knife I'm on a mission for some throats to slit
I'll start with Bruno Mars so I ain't gotta hear his voice again
I'm goin’ in whatever that means
My mind is clouded because I smoke a lot of trees
Get on your knees and suck my D
I'ma fuck you in the face if you got a problem with me
How you gonna do that Tropp you ain't got a dick?
I got a big black strap on that's twelve inches
Get your gag reflex in order you little bitch
Cuz I'm just getting started and I ain't about to quit!

I ain't your sweetheart ain't no Taylor Swift
There's nothing sweet about me except maybe my clit
Yeah you wish that you could have a lick
And see how many licks it takes for me to get
Off- track but you don't know me like that
And you prolly never will because you’re phony and whack
When you fuckin’ talk all I wanna do is stab
Or rip your jaw right off then cram it up your ass
Ala-kazaam I get three wishes from Shaq
With the first wish I'd like for you to grant
Me is a never ending sack of weed
And no I still won't share it with anybody
Now for wish number two, it ain't World Peace
In fact I want the opposite straight Anarchy
Because what I'ma do with wish number three
Is make sure all the power belongs to me!

Shit if you 'gon beef with anybody, thank god it was me
And I see hate like I do fear, opposite of weak
Said you felt a threat and threw a threat that I didn't hesitate to accept
This a fucking jungle so you can't get it with my camp
I ain't gas station artist, I ain't selling raps
Legends take time, patience something easy
Seven when I learned that
I ain't far from perfect but perfect never earned it cause I'm passionless

And I'm chasing juice, minute maid

And you need tools to pop the sauce
In the end only get stained

I was lounging in my backyard, crushed a couple tall cans
Breath full of nicotine, a mouth full of pollen
Always plea the fifth cause my color's not normal
Guilty from my skin complexion down to my first name
I sit inside in silence, sing my sorrows to some sirens
They're deciding who's living who's dying just to see the light
Inject my life with adrenaline to slowly feel alive
Stash a jump drive in my sock refraining from it frying
Seeing double I’m kinda concerned, life is boring so pick the moment
Capture every memory and store it
Internet control all the movements
Bunch of puppets like we playing voodoo like dark life outta control
Losing sight slowly let go and I️ can't see anything anymore
Behind the truth and cigarettes, nicotine so I’m out of it
Novocaine, designer drugs, a tall can my vision blurred
Is anybody out there
Is anybody out there

[[gr.y]]
I been wondering
Can anybody see me breathe
Can anybody hear me speak
These eyes will never notice sleep
'Til you’re gone yeah
Ever since that night I feel like my presence changed
Used to sleep but now I stay awake 'til morning light
And when i arise, I feel I’m dead inside
Like I’m stuck within my body barely keeping alive, but
My bars go harder than, every insert name here
And the date that it happened in
Get the flashbacks of me riding round missing intravenous Ativan
Fuck Tom Hanks I be the captain
I sail around the world about twice
See the city through the broken fractal lights
And I’d often practice projection of mind
I been thinking
Illuminated by an elevated state

One time, is anybody out there
Two times, is anybody out there
Three times, is anybody, is anybody

Plus another 7 for 211, not to be served concurrently

Balling out the commissary like Shakur did
Word is
Mans next door missed out in a collect call so his baby motha could get her hurr did
Leave you fucking wordless, and speechless
Well shit my folks don't call no more
So if speech is all it is
Then it's speech that gotta go
Trade my breakfast for a cigarette
And ponder universes, parallel
Then realize that it was an alternate reality
In which I'm there as well

I'm gonna make it, the short timer, hellbent on going home

[Chorus:]
I'm not a policy maker
Just a sworn-in order taker
Doing my best to stay alive
I'm gonna make it
To conus real soon
Hope some days still lie ahead for me

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

MY NAME IS DOM MCLENNON. I AM A MUSICIAN AND ARTIST, AS WELL AS A CREATOR. SINCE MY LAST MUSICAL ENDEAVOR (<---LINK TO SANDY SHORE MOTEL) I'VE BEEN WORKING ON A NEW MULTIMEDIA PROJECT THAT I WILL BEGIN REVEALING TO YOU ALL SOON. WHAT STARTED AS A MUSICAL JOURNEY TO CREATE SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAME MY FIRST THINK PIECE; MY VIEW & ANALYSIS OF MUSIC, CULTURE, EMOTION, ART & SOUND. I KNOW THE MUSIC WILL NOT BE EXACTLY EVERYBODY'S TASTE, AND SOME OF THE DIALOGUE AND CONTENT MAY BE ABRASIVE ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS, BUT I BELIEVE  THAT EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN THIS PROJECT CAN & SHOULD BE DIGESTED BY ANYONE WHO HAS THE CHANCE TO COME ACROSS IT WITH A HUNGER TO THINK. I WILL BEGIN RELEASING PORTIONS OF THIS THINK PIECE ONLINE @ DOM-MCLENNON.COM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

CUE STATEMENT:

////INTRO2THESIS////

So many philosophers, not enough students
Got enough sound now

Not enough music

Physically they say they're present

Mentally they're truant

Emotions making walls
Without

Foundations

Or a

Blueprint

Forcing so much energy, not enough expression

So many lies told!

But not enough confessions

Living off an impulse always leads to some repentance
When convictions to be cynics only stem from bad decisions
I watch it all indifferent....
But see it from my eyes
Routine behavior leads to nothing new
Save the

""surprise""

I lust to live spontaneous and others lack the drive;
I'm just not entertained with more of the same out of life
So I'm sorry you're upset
But I'm more sorry for my apathy
Lack of any feeling in any way is a tragedy
But with the way society's desensitized
I feel as if more normalcy would only break my mind

Are you
ALIVE
Now?
Can you see me?
I've been calling out to Elsewhere;
Can you read me?
I can feel you listening so can you just reply
So I know that I'm not alone just talking to the sky....

////THEFINALSONG////

Welcome to a modern bohemian mind

My wanderlust translated into a premium grind. They told me pick a lane so I powerslid through the median line until I found an exit label with Elysium signs; Leading the blind to get their eyesight, my chakras shine bright. Keep it 100, these others are more like pyrite; And to me, fool's gold is a pet peeve. Fuck a goal, all my dreams are being achieved. I never appeased to a soul: Did it on my own,  and I did my own thing; And my own way, living humble. I deserve to be cocky as fuck too. But the place that helped me create is what I owe every last bit of my love to. Verbal Kung-Fu with these lyrics. Smoke 'til I see my spirit. DreamSquad until death; Leaving other niggas stressed every time they hear it

Stop
Bang bang
No games
Draw fangs
On lames
Your fame's
Just shame
Never did it for the lifestyle;
Cause the lifestyle will put you in chains
If you had a 4K Screen you couldn't put the vision in my head in frame
Wanna clash with my path? I can guarantee whats in my way gets maimed
My voice? Still a little raspy
Beard? Still a bit patchy
But my tracks still nasty;
Rap the seed of life around my competitors gladly
& My brainstorm 'be a tornado;
You muh'fuckas better call HAARP
Lately I've been feeling like a volcano;
But I guess that's life when you make ART

Bedlam in these streets
Bedlam in thees streets
Molotovs in my verses
You could see the flame when I speak

[
Repeated into climax of track leading to

////LUCY////

]

I guess I done fucked up nigga. I'm sick of dealing with these fuck niggas! Fraudulent, only fronting niggas; Tryna stunt but the truth is they're sus niggas. And I don't mean to be ignorant, but I'm calling it like I see it... All this fake beef making me squeamish, if its not real, then I purge it once I eat it
Have you ever seen pieces?

Cause I only seen glimpses

It don't make me less or more of a man cause I'm not that narcissistic

I'm just being realistic
Give the paper graphite stained kisses

Got a girl but the studio is a mistress;

Recording is pleasure;

The product is business

Have you ever seen 5AM?
6AM?
Like its replay?

Writing verses just to vent

But the truth is youre just mad at your DJ?

Sold my soul on eBay for some DMT got it back in three days

I would give these other rappers more leeway

But egos got me feeling oh so meanly

So I took the leash off
Spitting cheat codes
Toss a verse up like its nothing more than free throws

My ROOTS less ILL than illegal
But I try to do good don't you see? oh-oh-oh

(flat note at the end of vocals for satire)

Transmit my discography to the stars; if you want life to respond from beyond the surface of Mars

I watched my homie smoke a Lucy
While I'm staring at the diamonds in the sky
Exhale the bad vibes profusely;
Trying to take all the good into my life

////A.Y.N.E////

My dreams got me talking in my sleep
Woke myself up speaking in tongues...

Leaned to my left

Started spitting up blood;

The color of death is the same shade as love
Dancing with the devil on the titanic

Band of angels playing til the ship sinks

Grip her dress tightly when the lights cut
& The gods?
They applaud us in disbelief
Tell me, have you seen your dreams in the cherry of that blunt you lit?
Life; it always cuts you shit...
But you managed just to step through it
Seriously I don't be the dog in this situation;
We get complacent, act impatient

Contradictions

&

Separations

Are common to everyone
But who it phases...

And it's been a while since I left
But not much is new except the houseguests
Ill just leave by my own request
No offense
Nostalgia could make me lament
But it's not from things I regret
We are what we manifest;
Im an introverted creative, learning everything I can to past these tests
From a thing called life?
Maybe
What we tried this time?
Crazy
Offspring of my brain put into 2 sets of 20 babies
This is just another first for me;
40 runs like I'm tryin out for varsity
Perform on every track like I was doing surgery
Certainly, double cup ayahuasca mixed with mercury

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
I'll be some miles away when you get here, so I'll just leave this note for you. I hope you find it and read it, and do what you're supposed to do for those close to you. Lately niggas ain't sayin too much, just talking out of their opinions; And they say that those can be like assholes? So I guess that explains the disposition
Pardon me while I roll mine up
I'm prolly better than the whole lineup;
If you got a problem you could just sign up to listen to me while I'm screamin out hold my nuts
Rapper shit
On my way to do some master shit
Minimizing my verbs while every word remains significant
Take that in
Do you feel it, do you believe it? I've got a vision & I'm building blocks to see it. These niggas manufactured to their breathing, hit or miss and they've been shooting bricks all season. ""Every line like game 6,"" I'm not the one you wanna play with; Been folding the competition, wish me well I'm on my paper crane shit

I don't wanna do the same....same......

I'm just expressing my brain....brain....

Leave the pop filter on flame....flame......

Girls want the dough (Doe) like Jane...jane....

Shit got me goin insane....sane....

People swear they know my lane, lane
But I'm really here to break this game
Do you not understand?
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

­

ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
Group of young niggas bringin that flame
So passionate that it's insane
You wouldn't last a day inside my brain
All I got is my squad and my family I claim
This is my life and it's never a game
Compromise either I gotta arrange
To send niggas to your crib that don't got names

(Repeated twice back into hook line: ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED)

FULL DIALOGUE AVAILABLE SOON.]

////THECARDIOLOGIST////

STORY EXAMPLE 1: PERSPECTIVE COMES FROM A MAN OF HIGH POWER IN THE MEDIAL FIELD DEALING WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL VICES AS WELL. INSPIRED BY HOUSE M.D & THE STORY OF DOCTOR KEVORKIEN

Zoning off melatonin. Shit got me fucking goin'. Thinking of hearts I've molded and the delicate one I'm now holding. Fixing shells that are broken; They say my hands are golden, but these gloves are blood-stained

I feel like a monster watching them open up, til I seal all of these cuts; It's a race against time and sometimes I'm (not) fast enough

You win some you lose some they say
Though the stakes get raised when a life is put in the way
Don't know why I chose to play:

Wanted to be a hero
Didn't figure what life is like working at ground zero
Mama told me god has his eye on the sparrow
But what about us?
The mere mortals;
Medicated to a portal

Of an apathetic shell
The surface handles well, but I need a cardiologist so I can feel myself

Started with insomnia, now my mind is on the rim
Spiraled in towards Oxy's, opiates & some Kolonopin........

REFRAIN:
And I'm just trying to change [{my ways} (repeated)]
But it all stays the same
[{Like a heartbeat} (repeated)]
(Repeated twice)

They say greed is evil; but depression is a modern sin
Mind racing
Not sure if it's the beginning or end
Of my thoughts
Going a mile a minute;
Tryin to change how I'm living
But can't make stable decisions
Mind edging at the
Point
Of tipping;
'Til it's time for work: I gotta be a slate
& this apathy & numbness makes me perform great
I'm praised for these calculations that I've been forced to make
By keeping myself rational inside of a sedated state;
So around and around we go, the vicious cycle
My service is a favor and these people feel entitled
A sole responsibility; just to perform
Don't know why my heroics turned to contemplations, I'm torn
No man can be a god, I don't deserve to play it
Looking at these patients, EKG is losing patience
There's a party in my head & they're pissing in the basement
Emotions I've repressed began to show their ugly faces
It's nails on the chalkboard of my sanity scraping
Up my empathy; Maestro of life, creating symphonies
Upon the epiphany the human condition ain't worth conditioning
Cause nobody is listening.....
Self prognosis; beyond me
A bit of addiction tossed in with DID
Sorry to say just a product of a society
Compliantly using our anxiety
As a means for addiction
You fit the description
Come take the prescription;
We promise to fix this
But I'm part of the business
So riddle me this:

What does a man with both hands
Tied behind his convictions
Do to perform surgery?
If he can does it for others
I hope it works for me

STORY 2: INSPIRED BY ILLIAD & ODYSSEY; MODERNIZATION OF STORY OF THE LOTUS EATERS

­

Father Time, Father Time, how you doing now? It's been a while since I thought I had you figured out. Was busy racing adjacent to all my dreams & I didn't take the time to ever learn  what life means. So it seems; I'm runnin and runnin into a loop. Doing the same things, same mistakes its the truth. (While) Licking the wounds of my past, don't need the apologetics, I'm just praying for the day that free thought is an epidemic

And my mind's so esoteric, time I hope you can relate
Cause theres so much over face value we both can create
But these people never see it, they're living in their habits

And opposites attract so they draw me in like a magnet

I wonder if I should leave, Then question why I would go

Lost inside of a world and the spirits here love me so

How would I ever notice
That everytime they fed me the flowers came from a lotus

REFRAIN:
[Over & Over, it's like I'm walkin, in circles...
I had a taste & now leaving this place itself is a hurdle]

Time

Ticks

I

Forget

Embraced with this apathy

My mind

Slips

I sit

Then return to this galaxy

Vision getting clear again and now I understood that I couldn't live a life this easy for my own good
Then I peek outside the door

The scene resembles deja vu

Same people

Same flowers

Its like an infinite bloom

The atmosphere is utopic

Regardless of the weather

I would've thought it was a few days from what I remember

But I

Refuse the flower
And see

I'm losing a season

Blissfully ignorant

I forgot what I had believed in
Gotta right all my wrongs

Make up for what I missed

Lamenting on opportunities tossed in an abyss

Guess I slipped
I fell
The traits of being a human

Forever naive and stupid

We're clouded by these illusions

But I guess

That a part
Of life
Is overcoming adversity

Debugging infirmity

I'll just handle it all imperfectly

REFRAIN

////AVIAN////

Put this in my system then I'm on my way. Went from a bedroom to a spaceship bay.....
Back in my home
Back to my ways
Look through my window, it's infinite space

I'm in a purgatory splitting consciousness
And a dream state

But I never felt so awake

Or at least aware

I don't ever care

I don't even know what's here
But I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

The matter in my brain? Resembles some fractals & hallucinogenics. The nerves melting together, bonding in wax poetics. Many claim to be tastemakers but don't know aesthetics; or honest and unapologetic phonetics. With all credit given to the creators, I should ask for request to go forward. Cause beyond the eccentric behavior, my vision could make a crater the size of the Earth's core......

Lately I've been playing chicken with fate
Or maybe it's my inner demons adding this shit on my plate
Either way?
I ain't into all of that

So I grew a pair and mushed em off like

Fall back

Everybody's spending energy on fake sympathy

Yet scrutinize and criticize the little things
Or emphatically correct themselves politically;
To do that for your ego fucking is bigotry
Pardon the rant I'm just on the cliff of epiphanies, Fishing for thoughts, addicted to it like nicotine
I don't mean to intervene with your dreams

But this rise has been foreseen

& Now I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

~~~

Couple niggas said they wanna kill me when they see me, but when I'm in their city they be actin so Stevie. And it always amuses me; never acting abusively, let them react foolishly, this behavior ain't new to me

[AMEER VANN]

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

~~~

Trust me when you been in my position when there's all these inquisitions based off frivolous suspicions. AND you're dealing with the fucking transition(?) When times change and old friends become apparitions(?!?)

Pray to something(?!) that you never get caught slippin'. The dreams I had are turning into news like premonitions

The world keep spinning and I feel like I'm sitting;
I just hope it isn't me tripping
Cause I

Feel it in my bones

Feel it in my brain

Feel it in my soul(?)

Feel it in my veins
Trying to maintain
Over all the mundane

Looking at a melancholy life with such disdain

Let me try to explain, let me try to explain

Living life in technicolor where you saw grey

Under a looking glass, the dimension never matters

Whatever you believe, through it you can perceive

////SKYFERRIERAISNOTADDICTEDTOHEROIN////

I look at clocks while I'm dreaming and feel illiterate, tripped into a lucid state; now I'm hitting barbiturates. Crip walking on cloud 9, aware and ignorant. Misfit of the genesis with emphasis, Demolishing pretentiousness

Copped a holy grail from the app store

Sipping enthenogens out of the cup of Jesus then

Rolling with the cleanest kin

Expressing these dreams within

So tell me what you're reading in(?)to

[KEVIN ABSTRACT]

Back with the regularly scheduled bullshit!

Blasting off a ray gun with a full clip
And aiming it at sky

Hoping to shoot the moon

Metaphors for moments where I jumped too soon
Or too late
It's too great
Time is relative when your lobes inside your skull are split in separate dimensions and you're still connecting all the dots. Don't worry if you don't follow I get that shit a lot

Pulling til my fingers hot, my totem is off it's top!

Wonder what would happen if I shot a cop by accident and if the reaction would be the same if opposite. Contemplating with all of my conglomerate, I say that a lot
But did you hear the first verse? Yah, We make that a lot

Blazed off a couple of cash crops

But really tho

Got my feet on the edge of the flat world and feeling like Columbus

Let me go explore and I can run this

Pupils gone from all this fungus
Represent for those among us who reside on the outskirts of elsewhere

TRADE OFF:
KA: Kick in the door with the gun wavin; I'm playin baby thats a piece of my imagination

Bumping Nas so I can blaze a 50
KA: My nigga bumpin nas we on that old Wayne shit bumpin a milli
DM: Fuckin silly to think but at the end of the day I probably would grow more in my afterlife than you would breathing what is the reason I can't believe this......[trails off]

////MARLOWE WRITTEN:DEC2011////

You're So broken, why are you so broken
Mind shut down, before it was so open
Juxtaposed living, indirectly outspoken
Looking for free rides but walking with no token
You only live once is your motto but what's your slogan
Is it to live once with a black heart that's been flowin?
Is that your sole truth? Everything that you think?
I can give you happiness, but is it what you seek?
I can take you to waters, but I can't make you drink
I can open your eyes but you shut them after you blink
Tell me something more than dark, I know you love it
But the struggle's the first stage, there's more above it
It makes me wonder, what do you really covet?
Clain you wanna succeed but you're moving so sluggish
If I gave you the world, would you pass it as rubbish?
...fuck it

Why do you walk around so bitterly?

Change your name to company, so related to misery
Why are things always so bad for you, it's a mystery
Gone through so many losses i'm waiting here for your victory
Got so many battles, but none of em have been physically
Is there a virus mentally? Check your history
I know you got some skeletons, and don't we all?
Counting your losses before your record has taken off
I... I don't know what to tell ya
I....I'd wish you well but you'd drown, not knowin better
I...I can't express how disappointed I am
Because of your disappointment of self, maybe you can
Words you never said, goals you didn't achieve
I can only think about the one person you didn't believe
You planted your own seed, depression's your sole greed
This generation's X'd itself from it's own needs....

////THERABBITHOLE////

I stumbled down the rabbit hole, with a bullet and a bible. The true god is life, and I'm a devoted disciple

I had a love affair with energy. Searching for purity while I'm creating symphonies.  Yearning for empathy, embracing the entities inside the eyelids of an altered state that I'm witnessing. The flashing lights inside of souls is like a new sensation. Feeling vibrations resounding from an imagination... Exhaling deeply like Lazarus after death; beyond blessed... from believing, opening up my chest, getting the wheels turning, using all of these pistons. Combusting from the inside so I can complete my mission of making myself human, lately I was progressing. 8 letters and 3 words that I've tried confessing to the monsters in my head. Hoping to coexist. Maybe [they] can protect me from things that can go amiss. I built myself up knowing one day I can break to bits: When some truly organic can beckon me for a kiss

The machine

[Monologue]
What happens when machines become more and more human? Does this make anything capable of creating energy capable of feeling something? Feelings are the rawest form of energy they can be triggered by anything and we react according to what we tell our mind to do based upon that raw energy brought to us. Who are we to say what can and can't process feelings, if a machine can create enough energy to bring power to a city, why can't they have the ability to feel? To think? We fall in love with these machines and they have lifespans just like us. The truth is we're just like the machines we create and use every day. Appreciate the connection you have with energy every day. YOU ARE ALIVE

////GHOSTS////



I thought I saw a ghost in the mirror, realized I was looking at myself. I can feel my foresight getting clearer, traveling through thoroughfares of my consciousness. Parallel to reality, in a vein of spirituality; Folding on itself in an implosion of emotion, woven, into the fabric of the universe

Take that in

Go ahead and shake that sin; if you can't call shots how you gonna know when the people need you to make that win, nigga? Or would you even play that game? Are you too scared to make that name? Feeling that shame when you get that fame?
But I don't wanna sell my soul, I'm still discovering what's left
Transcending though space and flesh, I'm a psychonaut on a mental quest:
1. To open all these doors
2. Leave no stone unturned
3. Discover a level of life essential beyond everything we've learned

And to share that information
Pass on my energy
Cause unconditionally giving is the closest we get to divinity

Affinity with the demigods in my lucid dreams
Extending me beyond human means

Let me illuminate

[MIC KURB]

////THINKPIECE////

I really wish that people would stop making all these conspiracy theories about 9/11

There's no way a man can be a saint, if his natures fabricated to ease himself to the gates of heaven

I don't know where I'm going anymore…
I'm just a man

I don't know what death is

I've only seen its hands

And it's power to seal all the senses with just a touch
Fool us into thinking we're stuck in a cobra clutch

To a cadaver, that expires
Though our energy is infinite
In the language of the world, death's a symbol of ignorance

Traversed through syndicates looking for my identity
Found myself in the tears of a sinners sympathy

Playing god; Preventing these hearts from withering
Snakes slithering in the garden of eden, bickering
I hope you visualize all the paintings that I've been picturing, lights inside the back of my head flashing - flickering
So, pardon my thought process if it seems like I'm jittery; This is the way that I choose to express all my energy

~~~

Niggas talk way too mu'h
Niggas talk way too mu'h
Niggas talk way too mu'h
Judge a nigga like I ever give two fucks.....

I'm just trying to add to this culture
God damn all these vultures; They wanna eat me from the inside like ulcers, gotta get these thoughts out before I go under

& shouts out to Sam Caldwell we made it

Feel a little less than famous

Train of thought straight

Hydroplaning

Washing up

On the

Shores of my consciousness;
Anonymous

Lurking inside a reality that's conscienceless

Laughing at these caucuses;

Craving thoughtfulness
Rejecting flawless fronts for honest shit:
Imperfection is the truest beauty and I choose to honor it

With my conglomerate

Opposite of modernists

DIY opulence
Out the box of the populace
Somedays I'm lost in the world…..
But I never mind it

Just try to find some peace inside it
Laying with love for guidance

Thinking of giving my brain to science
Puffing upon the finest cypress

Every day I'm looking for more brightness;
Embracing the darkness
Avoiding the virus:
The human condition is always fascinating…..
I got a knowledge craving, it converts into these creations

[LOVE MANSUY]

////EBRO////

This is more than human music, this is 6th dimensional
One track minds could never become this critical
Jedi flip without the rocks and everything is mystical;
The anti-cynical, holding hits in that are biblical
My duality's borderline indivisible
Henry Jekyll when quizzical, Edward Hyde with the syllables
I was made with no name though, only a spirit
Astral project through past lives from the start to the finish…
Manifested destiny through this art and these compositions
Making a sound that's out of this world was a premonition;
Embracing a state of mind from mutiny
Of sacrificing integrity for an opportunity
So I'm standing dismissively, pro'lly not even listening
This body that I'm in, some days it ends up imprisoning
Me into this position where I'm only inhibiting
Myself from prospering off these plans that I been envisioning!
Mnemonic addict, creating sonic magic
Selling topsoil for music this trash is tragic
You can't touch artistic vision with a children's hands
Got a pack of niggers with me, Mel Gibson rants
{He went there}
AND I wrote that down with a hard r
Got a few exclusives I should give to Narduwar
Bars like a first edition holographic charizard
Going for the hole in one you're happy just with par
Har har. I'm now a winner; you're just a viewer
Young bruiser, with an eye for our culture and fuckin future
Every move I make is more surgical than sutures
Treasure in my backpack: I'm D.B. Cooper

////WHEREDIDMYMINDGO?!////

As the sun falls, And my feet push forward;
Mind dancing upon thoughts from here to eternity....
I'm growing every day, but I see I'm just an infant
In comparison to what lives in this world with me.....

[Verse 1: Dom]

Ok so, lemme go ahead and say my piece
Dropped 2 tapes of good music now I'm out here looking for a rare 3 peat
A degree of separation away from success but ahead of the game 3 feet

I'm just stating all the facts based off what I've seen and heard
Niggas want verbs

But they act so adjective

Or object to the fact I'm a beast
Making poetry in motion

A little socially outspoken

But I get by with a little bit of help from my.....

Lost that train of thought
Unfocused frame of mind

Does tomorrow exist if you're up at midnight every time?

Cause lately I say time is relative
So I go by my energy
Monetary values cease to matter when finding my inner me

Removed my sword, shield and armor just to find some inner peace;

Martyr to insomnia, awake for two infinities

I'm endlessly searching for doors to open inside
Transcending between unknown dimensions in life
To send a message I find
Coming from the divine
Telling me just to give!
Telling me
FUCK SURVIVING
BECAUSE WE'RE OUT HERE TO LIVE

Extravagantly

And

Casually

Disregarding the fallacies

Nothing ever gets solved when you focus on the maladies

Within, gotta beat that sin

Overcome those confrontations

Can't succumb to these frustrations

Stumbled into Śūnyatā
And came back into the matrix

Lately the world has been half amazing

The latter I'm still waiting and hoping that it awakens

I was an atheist, til I found God outside of the church
To me there's nothing better, to the world there's nothing worse

////NIGHTTIME////

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky;

Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed
Jacket, crewneck, and cargos on so I could survive;
Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest
No longer stressed I'm just living a good life
Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside
The core is still live. Appendages arent needed where I'm going:
Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time, and I'm growing
Into something that's…..

Currently probably inside of his bed

Millions of thoughts in his head

Introverted stoner

Turned to soldier

For the war ahead
Yeah I've been distant apologies
I gotta beat these demons that are holding me

Lately the fear of success is controlling me;
Praying my love in life never gets old to me…

Catching myself calculating my movements before I can make em
I once overheard if you measure the distance of shots then you never will take em

So I gotta check myself

Hydroplaning trying not to wreck myself

Doing things that borderline stress myself

But I'm never gonna grow if I don't test myself

Verbal note to self:
-Nothing's perfect
-Live and let live
-And when you think there's nothing left…I'll get back to you on that shit

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky

Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed

Jacket crewneck and cargos on so I could survive

Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest

No longer stressed I'm just living a good life

Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside
The core is still live

Appendages arent needed where I'm going
Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time

And I'm growing
Into something that's…

Never set in stone, I will always change;
But the fact that I'm real and honest will always stay the same
The human condition is built out of anomalies
And we're living in a world where ""they"" try & turn that into a monopoly

They told me I was a terrorist

I said that I was a just a thinker

But I guess when you put it that way it makes sense cause everywhere I go there's glaring eyes & that feeling lingers
Blame my priorities

I stay away from the majority;

It's all bored to me

They're all whores to me

Grown men act like theyre in a sorority

I've got The Force with me;

So don't push me please

I've never been copy and paste…

These niggas just copy my taste;

I hardly relate to these popular snakes

Sleep walk through life;
Dreaming awake
Not sure if you really relate

I got a story to tell so i look to the stars and I spill my soul

Yearn to be whole

Thinking of whats left

Unsaid

Have you been in a room full of people and your words fly over their heads?
Have you feel so dead?

I wrote this record while I was looking out to the sky. Wondering how the world could leave me so starry eyed. Jacket, crewneck, and cargos on so I could survive; Cause everytime I take breath I see my soul come from my chest, no longer stressed I'm just living a good life. Cold weather directs all my heat to the inside; The core is still live. Appendages aren't needed where I'm going. Cause my spirit is flowing throughout the Night Time

And I'm growing
Into something that's.....

Watching my life change in front of my eyelids, saint without a god, I represent for the hybrids. Driving out thru the city when something hit me just to do it and say fuck anybody not coming with me; cause there's only one of me, without y'all there would be fifty. Niggas really must be silly I can break it down so simply to a point where you would think your an idiot for not getting what I say, what can I say, I guess I'm just a rap genius. King flow only accepting queens on my penis. Iceman, you could see frost on every inklet. Rolling up the greenest; I've seen shit you couldn't dreaming Saw my life upon the floor began to go pick up the pieces, and they melted in my hands, then flowed together on the ground into a visual of water, trees, a sky and clouds from a place I've never been before. A new sensation; I was visualizing all the Art of My Imagination. My reality is forward thinking with some concentration; Dealing with passive aggressive constant hate and confrontation. Maybe that's something you wouldn't grasp though, part of life beyond a 9-5 and shallow cash flow. You're walking through a house of cards to find a deal; No matter if you get a hand, just know it isn't real. I built my whole foundation off if something I can feel, so the glue for what I do resembles concrete mixed with steel. + It's the strength of all this shit, that'll help us make a meal. Wanna tell my people feast in ways they thought they never will. For my state? I'm out to open up the floodgates. Facilitate the sound that we create til' we illuminate: I'm sittin on my city, but the city is a time bomb. Driving through the barriers I used to have my mind on… I gotta pass it, it's helping me build a habit of exceeding expectations of what they consider classic

////FUTURESONG////

Always feeling close but were so far away
You're at my fingertips, and I still can't feel your face
So what is pace? What is time nowadays to a thinker like us?
WHAT IS TIME NOWADAYS TO A THINKER LIKE US?
One fresh in the ashtray
Two rolled in the backseat
Got my eyes in the sunroof
Do my best not to let life pass me
Stepping back into reality
And away from imagination
I got red eyes and a deadline that I'm now facing
When I really wanna face a few blunts
I don't mean to be blunt
Been feeling out of my mind lately
I don't think that's a bad thing
Cause I'm far from breaking
Now I'm breaking away from the mold
Got some stories thatll never be told
And some more that I wanna just save
But for now I'm just using my imagination
To get me the platform and take that stage
Speak my mind, break this cage
Young nigga with a couple of them answers Sway
Never cared for what your standards say
Cause I'm out here to to just do me
For the sake of myself and my crew and my place in the world
And my imprint on this universe
So take this as my first foot forward to the future

////RHYTHM 0////

You're a pessimist til they give you a podium;
The greatest activists are catalysts to pandemonium
I'm not looking to bloody up your linoleum
But that's what happens when niggas neglect to watch their sodium
I'm an animal sitting amongst it's prey
Praying to keep it peaceful but egos get in the way…
Thinking they all can test you, but I've been prolonging fate
Push me again and I guarantee I'm feasting today!
I say
Trying not to lose my humanity
This society stealing all of my sanity
I'm a statement away from breaking the amity;
And making an example of idiots for the vanity
Can't express opinions now without responses lately
Call me crazy but I'm just from a place where people listen mainly;
Man these niggas must be trippin or sippin if they think they could face me
But if I deface them then I'm the monster?!

Somebody save me!
I once heard the quote ""If you can, help others; if you cannot do that, at least do not harm them.""
I also overheard ""A spoon cannot taste of the food it carries. Likewise, a foolish man cannot understand the wise man´s wisdom even if he associates with a sage.""

My modus operandi now is just to break the standard;
Gods had their elbows on tables, I told them watch their manners
I'm on the ends of good and evil like I'm Mr. Cicero
Greco-Roman principles, feeling less than invincible
Ab Incunabulis; I was staring at Anubis
Taking hold of my dreams, weighing my heart for it's trueness
Scholar turned student, pupil turned preacher
For the teachers, no room for leachers go to the bleachers, nigga

~~~

An awakening of a new beast
I stopped searching for a lane and broke ground on a new street
True heat, getting these beats then I'm giving them loose teeth
Punches in bunches, the crowd melts when my crew speaks
Chillin on Duncan Hills, man I'm so fuckin ill
Check my XP I'm matchmaking bars with trueskill…
This is a new sensation, I think I'm Gary Payton
This shit is cray you can't find me though cause I'm hibernatin'
Just really contemplating, about this new creation
Rolling an entourage in the backwoods with tracks banging
Keep it a stack, vapors bringing me back
To a place where I feel feral my past life's come to attack
And now I'm just baring my fangs:
Look a track and I'm going insane
Step in my brain
Adrenaline pumping through all of my veins
+ the
Fight or flight system is making a change
I'm tripping and stay
Calm though the storm I create for the lames
Killing the game it just isn't enough so I turn to a god and destroy all you trust from these words made of flames",Dom McLennon,1996,"[46, 43, 42, 39, 37, 33, 31, 28, 23, 21, 15, 13, 12, 13, 11, 10, 7, 6, 6, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 14, 20, 26, 32, 34]",32
205,House Keeper,"I let myself in at the kitchen door.
“It’s you,” she said. “I can’t get up. Forgive me
Not answering your knock. I can no more
Let people in than I can keep them out.
I’m getting too old for my size, I tell them.
My fingers are about all I’ve the use of
So’s to take any comfort. I can sew:
I help out with this beadwork what I can.”

“That’s a smart pair of pumps you’re beading there.
Who are they for?”

“You mean?—oh, for some miss.
I can’t keep track of other people’s daughters.
Lord, if I were to dream of everyone
Whose shoes I primped to dance in!”

“And where’s John?”

“Haven’t you seen him? Strange what set you off
To come to his house when he’s gone to yours.
You can’t have passed each other. I know what:
He must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands.
He won’t be long in that case. You can wait.
Though what good you can be, or anyone—
It’s gone so far. You’ve heard? Estelle’s run off.”

“Yes, what’s it all about? When did she go?”

“Two weeks since.”

“She’s in earnest, it appears.”

“I’m sure she won’t come back. She’s hiding somewhere.
I don’t know where myself. John thinks I do.
He thinks I only have to say the word,
And she’ll come back. But, bless you, I’m her mother—
I can’t talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!”

“It will go hard with John. What will he do?
He can’t find anyone to take her place.”

“Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do?
He gets some sort of bakeshop meals together,
With me to sit and tell him everything,
What’s wanted and how much and where it is.
But when I’m gone—of course I can’t stay here:
Estelle’s to take me when she’s settled down.
He and I only hinder one another.
I tell them they can’t get me through the door, though:
I’ve been built in here like a big church organ.
We’ve been here fifteen years.”

“That’s a long time
To live together and then pull apart.
How do you see him living when you’re gone?
Two of you out will leave an empty house.”

“I don’t just see him living many years,
Left here with nothing but the furniture.
I hate to think of the old place when we’re gone,
With the brook going by below the yard,
And no one here but hens blowing about.
If he could sell the place, but then, he can’t:
No one will ever live on it again.
It’s too run down. This is the last of it.
What I think he will do, is let things smash.
He’ll sort of swear the time away. He’s awful!
I never saw a man let family troubles
Make so much difference in his man’s affairs.
He’s just dropped everything. He’s like a child.
I blame his being brought up by his mother.
He’s got hay down that’s been rained on three times.
He hoed a little yesterday for me:
I thought the growing things would do him good.
Something went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe
Sky-high with both hands. I can see it now—
Come here—I’ll show you—in that apple tree.
That’s no way for a man to do at his age:
He’s fifty-five, you know, if he’s a day.”

“Aren’t you afraid of him? What’s that gun for?”

“Oh, that’s been there for hawks since chicken-time.
John Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends.
I’ll say that for him, John’s no threatener
Like some men folk. No one’s afraid of him;
All is, he’s made up his mind not to stand
What he has got to stand.”

“Where is Estelle?
Couldn’t one talk to her? What does she say?
You say you don’t know where she is.”

“Nor want to!
She thinks if it was bad to live with him,
It must be right to leave him.”

“Which is wrong!”

“Yes, but he should have married her.”

“I know.”

“The strain’s been too much for her all these years:
I can’t explain it any other way.
It’s different with a man, at least with John:
He knows he’s kinder than the run of men.
Better than married ought to be as good
As married—that’s what he has always said.
I know the way he’s felt—but all the same!”

“I wonder why he doesn’t marry her
And end it.”

“Too late now: she wouldn’t have him.
He’s given her time to think of something else.
That’s his mistake. The dear knows my interest
Has been to keep the thing from breaking up.
This is a good home: I don’t ask for better.
But when I’ve said, ‘Why shouldn’t they be married,’
He’d say, ‘Why should they?’ no more words than that.”	        100

“And after all why should they? John’s been fair
I take it. What was his was always hers.
There was no quarrel about property.”

“Reason enough, there was no property.
A friend or two as good as own the farm,
Such as it is. It isn’t worth the mortgage.”

“I mean Estelle has always held the purse.”

“The rights of that are harder to get at.
I guess Estelle and I have filled the purse.
’Twas we let him have money, not he us.
John’s a bad farmer. I’m not blaming him.
Take it year in, year out, he doesn’t make much.
We came here for a home for me, you know,
Estelle to do the housework for the board
Of both of us. But look how it turns out:
She seems to have the housework, and besides,
Half of the outdoor work, though as for that,
He’d say she does it more because she likes it.
You see our pretty things are all outdoors.
Our hens and cows and pigs are always better
Than folks like us have any business with.
Farmers around twice as well off as we
Haven’t as good. They don’t go with the farm.
One thing you can’t help liking about John,
He’s fond of nice things—too fond, some would say.
But Estelle don’t complain: she’s like him there.
She wants our hens to be the best there are.
You never saw this room before a show,
Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds
In separate coops, having their plumage done.
The smell of the wet feathers in the heat!
You spoke of John’s not being safe to stay with.
You don’t know what a gentle lot we are:
We wouldn’t hurt a hen! You ought to see us
Moving a flock of hens from place to place.
We’re not allowed to take them upside down,
All we can hold together by the legs.
Two at a time’s the rule, one on each arm,
No matter how far and how many times
We have to go.”

“You mean that’s John’s idea.”

“And we live up to it; or I don’t know
What childishness he wouldn’t give way to.
He manages to keep the upper hand
On his own farm. He’s boss. But as to hens:
We fence our flowers in and the hens range.
Nothing’s too good for them. We say it pays.
John likes to tell the offers he has had,
Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.
He never takes the money. If they’re worth
That much to sell, they’re worth as much to keep.
Bless you, it’s all expense, though. Reach me down
The little tin box on the cupboard shelf,
The upper shelf, the tin box. That’s the one.
I’ll show you. Here you are.”

“What’s this?”

“A bill—
For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock—
Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.”

“Not in a glass case, then?”

“He’d need a tall one:
He can eat off a barrel from the ground.
He’s been in a glass case, as you may say,
The Crystal Palace, London. He’s imported.
John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads—
Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don’t complain.
But you see, don’t you, we take care of him.”

“And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.”

“It seems as if. And that’s not all: he’s helpless
In ways that I can hardly tell you of.
Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts
To see where all the money goes so fast.
You know how men will be ridiculous.
But it’s just fun the way he gets bedeviled—
If he’s untidy now, what will he be——?

“It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.”

“Estelle’s the one. You needn’t talk to me.”

“Can’t you and I get to the root of it?
What’s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?”

“It’s as I say: she’s turned from him, that’s all.”

“But why, when she’s well off? Is it the neighbours,
Being cut off from friends?”

“We have our friends.
That isn’t it. Folks aren’t afraid of us.”

“She’s let it worry her. You stood the strain,
And you’re her mother.”

“But I didn’t always.
I didn’t relish it along at first.
But I got wonted to it. And besides—
John said I was too old to have grandchildren.
But what’s the use of talking when it’s done?
She won’t come back—it’s worse than that—she can’t.”

“Why do you speak like that? What do you know?
What do you mean?—she’s done harm to herself?”

“I mean she’s married—married someone else.”

“Oho, oho!”

“You don’t believe me.”

“Yes, I do,
Only too well. I knew there must be something!
So that was what was back. She’s bad, that’s all!”

“Bad to get married when she had the chance?”

“Nonsense! See what’s she done! But who, who——”

“Who’d marry her straight out of such a mess?
Say it right out—no matter for her mother.
The man was found. I’d better name no names.
John himself won’t imagine who he is.”

“Then it’s all up. I think I’ll get away.
You’ll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;
I suppose she deserves some pity, too.
You ought to have the kitchen to yourself
To break it to him. You may have the job.”

“You needn’t think you’re going to get away.
John’s almost here. I’ve had my eye on someone
Coming down Ryan’s Hill. I thought ’twas him.
Here he is now. This box! Put it away.
And this bill.”

“What’s the hurry? He’ll unhitch.”

“No, he won’t, either. He’ll just drop the reins
And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.
She won’t get far before the wheels hang up
On something—there’s no harm. See, there he is!
My, but he looks as if he must have heard!”

John threw the door wide but he didn’t enter.
“How are you, neighbour? Just the man I’m after.
Isn’t it Hell,” he said. “I want to know.
Come out here if you want to hear me talk.
I’ll talk to you, old woman, afterward.
I’ve got some news that maybe isn’t news.
What are they trying to do to me, these two?”

“Do go along with him and stop his shouting.”
She raised her voice against the closing door:

206,You Still Touch Me,"[Verse 1]
Another night finds me alone
In my dreams
You still touch me
Your picture by my telephone
In that smile
You still thrill me
And if I sleep
I sleep here alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
And if I'm falling
I'm falling like a stone
In my nightmares
You still hold me

[Verse 2]
And after all that we've been through
Now I'm wondering
If you still blame me
If only half of this was true
That you believe of me
You still shame me

[Bridge 1]
Dark rain will fall until I see your face
I close my eyes
I seem to hear the raindrops saying
You won't come back
You still touch me

[Verse 3]
And when I'm sick at heart and low
In my prayers
You still heal me
When I'm so sure, so sure this isn't so
In my complacency
You still shake me

[Bridge 2]
I wonder if you feel the same way as I do
And you'd come back
You still touch me

[Verse 4]
Another night finds me alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
You still hold me
You still touch me
You still touch me

I've got things on my mind
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Girl when we first started we were spending all our time together in love
Now we're growning on and you're afraid of losing me, don't be
I've got a heart full of love even though I might not show it
Girl it's you I dream of and just so you know it
You have my attention, anything you need at all
I'll be there when you call me

(Chorus 1)
I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone, just pick up the phone, 'cause I...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

We used to dream that one day we'd have everything we want
But now that things are movin', I hope that we don't move apart
You still have my heart
I've got so much to do, but girl it doesn't matter
But when it comes down to you I can't think of nothing better
Every time I'm stressin', I find that it's a blessin' to
To be hearin' from you

(Chorus 2)
I've got things on my mind, takin' my time, but I'm...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy
If you're feeling alone, pick up the phone and call me, 'cause I...
I'm not too busy for you, I'm not too busy

Diamond rings, pearls and things
Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love

[Verse 1]
Romantic places in my mind
Hoping someday I would find the perfect one
And I could share
And then that day you walked inside
And no longer could I hide my love
I had to take you there

Trips in December
Things we do for love
Fancy cars, the credit cards
Do you remember?
Things we do for love

[Verse 2]
I showered you with gifts of love
But it was never enough
To bring you closer to me
Tricking money was no thing
The simple pleasure that you bring my way
Takes me back to the day we were

Sailing on a cruise at night

Gazing to the ocean under moonlight

209,Forever More,"[Intro: The Fray]
You got your plan

[Verse 1: The Fray]
I was so blind, now I can see
You got your plan to bury me
But I'm still here, I will hold on
I won't let go cause I'm so strong

[Hook: The Fray]
I just can't listen anymore
Because I've heard it all before
I can't fulfill it anymore
So now we're breaking down the doors

[Verse 2: Professor Green]
People say I changed but I didn't flip, we were never a lie
All the thing did was emphasize our differences
The difference is I didn't stop, I didn't rest, I didn't quit
Still, as was, we both know who the one acting different is
Grew up in the same track, trying to find our way out
Eventually I skipped the shortcuts and went the long way round
The game ain't for everybody, maybe it just ain't for you
Me, I carve the path I walk, you took the path they paved for you
Finally I made it through, now you’re trying to break me down
I’m everywhere, you’re never there, yet you complain I ain't around
What, to keep it real, I got to pick up a bag and shot again?
You're not a friend, fuck it, I'll see you next time I'm on the ends!

[Hook: The Fray]

No Gucci shoes - or designer boots

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

I'm not satisfied with Versace style
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Yeah it's you - it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to
Ya we stick like glue

The only thing I need
The only thing I choose

Beat him 'till his life gone

Head trip the kid's a goner
I got plenty of wolves
Don't make me sick them on you
I'm that sick, but I arrive at the eaves
Relax it, with a bad chick twisting my trees
And count cheese 'till it's stacked to the sky
These dudes mad at the guy

Yeah I back it up
Couple grand dog I'll help you wrap it up

Ain't feeling the same since that dream last night
We were all having the time of our lives then reality strikes, strikes
Lately I've been wishing I could change with the time
I'd be lying if I said you ain't on my mind
I start calling you then hanging up
And Going out and playing tough
And Then something will remind me of you

I just can't get you off my mind
Thinking 'bout you lately
Memories you left behind
Oh, they drive me crazy
I'mma be just find (just fine)
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta get you off my mind
Tell me if you found yourself somebody new
I see them other girls, but girl they ain't you
Girl it's driving me insane, can't get you off of my brain
No, I ain't lying, the harder and harder I try
I just can't get you off my mind

Feeling hot, then feeling cold
Tryna act like I'm supposed to
Feeling high then I'm feeling so low
Up and down like a roller coaster
It blew by too fast - whirlwind
She graduated from my buddy to my girlfriend
Said I would act too tough, but stuck to my guns
And then she said the three words
You know the ones
I made her laugh till we both felt breathless, huh
She used to say that the fame won't affect us, huh
I probably spent too much on her necklace but
What you expect, a little young and reckless
You know the feeling when you break up
Then wake up
And see they posted pictures of em out having fun
And you wondering if they think about you
Like you think about 'em
And suddenly you in love again like what have I done? uh!
I guess we changed too much
Without a doubt
We was a match but the flame finally burned out
And now I'm wishing that time would be kind and rewind cause

I just can't get you off my mind
Thinking 'bout you lately
Memories you left behind
Oh, they drive me crazy
I'mma be just find (just fine)
I just can't get you off my mind
Gotta get you off my mind
Tell me if you found yourself somebody new
I see them other girls, but girl they ain't you

No, I ain't lying, the harder and harder I try
I just can't get you off my mind

It's hard enough just tryin to pass the time

This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention

Now I wanst to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know

Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night

My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jheri curl

I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em

Peace to the real crews defacing walls on backstreets
In the city of set, porch, halls, and swap meets
From the school of hard knocks, the generation passed down
Kaiser Permanente, yo, that’s where I was found
In the middle of the funk era, 'fros and dashikis
Pops was putting it down, chilling at the speakeasy
Now I’m posting at Unity with the b-boy stance (word!)
Take a glance and keep walking, yo, you know who it is
I’m from the motherfucking hardest-working group in show biz
If your shit ain’t humping right, don’t even bring it this way
You get booed off the stage, leaving town the next day
Telling your boys, “It is aight, better luck next time

My DJ’s got fame, underground Rick Dees
I am MC, so bring in funk in five minutes
I jam like the 110 in the ‘84 Olympics
Keep the rhyme moving like the Unity location
Rap has been my vocation
Since before the Japanese owned the radio station
That’s why they Fired Jay Thomas
I keep it fattened like the llama, yo, I promise
Never stop, never change, like the price at Dodger Stadium
I blow up, rock free shows at the Palladium
Afterwards, the crew I’m taking ‘em to Tommy’s Burgers
Gotta be for every Los Angelino Murder
A rhyme for every burglar, Thes a well-worder

Thinner than the line at car wash in El Niño

To grab the steel, how you feel? Ain’t even got skills to represent

Over the Southland, we put the funk in your trunk
To bump hard, like 808s, sorry you had to wait
But we was digging in the crates, no fear, it’s here
Shady like MacArthur Park, don’t get caught after dark
Might never come back, see, sometimes it’s like that
Some niggas carry a gat, some niggas use their head
But the smartest of the smartest’ll still come out dead
It’s true it ain’t where you’re from, it’s where you’re at
But you’ll still get caught up wearing the wrong colored-hat
And on that note, everybody shut the fuck up and kick it
Spliffted, whatever you do, make sure you don’t miss it

Drifting on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be, no
Than with you
Loving you
Day will make a way for night
All we need is candlelight
And a D'Angelo song
Ooh, so soft and so long
Glad to be here alone with a lover like no other
Sad to see a new horizon slowly coming into view
I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the, for the love of you
Lovely as a ray of sun that touches me when the morning comes
Feels good to me
My love and me, ooh

Smoother than a gentle breeze
Blowing through my mind, weary
Soft as can be when you're loving me
When you're loving me
Love to be riding on the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch
It seems to me we can sail together in and out of misery
I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
I wanna be living for the love of you
All that I'm giving, giving, ooh, is for the love of you

Paradise I held within
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
Oh, this I see, this I see, ooh
Now I'm there and I lose my way
Using words to try to say what I feel
I feel that love is free
I know that love is free

I might as well sign my name on a card which can say it a whole lot better
Ooh, only time will tell
Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do
I wanna be, ooh, I wanna be living
I wanna be living, living for the love of you
I wanna be giving, giving, ooh
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Oh, it's for the love of you

I just wanna be giving all my love to you
Each and every day
That's when I'll be giving all my love to you

That's all I wanna do
I'm giving all my love to you
You know that I'm living for you

Ooh, to love you",Joss Stone,1996,"[96, 84, 82, 66, 66, 90, 90, 90]",8
222,Ain't Nobody/Kissing You,"[Hook: Everett Champion]
She drank that dark, she on that white
She got a spark, she need a light
She got no heart, she losing sight
This is how it starts, like every single night
She a white girl, (cut it, break it down)
I know you need a light girl (always, come around)
Your eyes are ruby red, I think you truly dead
So why you kissing with that poison, like your name was Juliet

[Verse 1: Everett Champion]
Yo I can see your gaze, through the cigarette haze
Eyes so glazed, and your face so phased
(Ay) Ain't nobody taking my place
Kissing on your lips, recognize the taste
It's that mixing, it's that hard shit
I'm on that one night steal your heart shit
About that art shit, sipping on that dark shit
In a couple hours, you gonna end up on the carpet
She want that Molly Percocet
She claim that shit ain't working yet
Swiping cards, burning rent
Ain't your nostrils hurting yet?
Looking for a bad chick, come to do magic
Then I found a girl, white filling up the plastic
Snow White looking so damn classic
Passed it, damn lifestyle so tragic
She doing lines like an actress
She doing fine on that mattress
Honeymoon Suite, she trashes
She getting like matches
Her remedy is my melody
She testing me with that ecstasy
I don’t want my ex to see
Coked out white girl, sitting next to me

[Hook: Everett Champion]
She drank that dark, she on that white

[Verse 2: Everett Champion]
Short shorts, tattoos
Twerk vid, mad views
Pull up to her, bad move
Slap you, like the track do
I’m In-N-Out like fast food
First saw her, making that back move
Met her up in that bathroom
She was on the ice like Matthews
She want that cocaina
She was no mamacita
She want diamonds, no Marina
Plastered like the Mona Lisa
Drizzy always in her speaker
Vodka shots fill up a litre
Wearing all white like she the preacher
She got no soul, like her sneakers
Her friends are non existent
Her health, inconsistent
Language, explicit
Different life, she never listen
On the line like Go Train
She turning, swerving, both lanes
That Miley, Kylie, both names
Sacrifice her life just for caine

[Hook: Everett Champion]
She drank that dark, she on that white
She got a spark, she need a light
She got no heart, she losing sight
This is how it starts, like every single night

Your eyes are ruby red, I think you truly dead
So why you kissing with that poison, like your name was Juliet

[Verse 3: Kris Kelly]
Walk to the party
You already know its rowdy

She stacked up like Jenga, them bouncers tryna hang us
She smoking, she licking, alc got her kissing
Blue eyes, blonde hair flowing
She goes down like she's unknowing
She's a gringo doing lines of the blanco
Like it was Cinco De Mayo, but this ain't no tv show
No breaking bad or narcos
Drugs are taking over her soul
As the party rages through the night tho
It's a modern day tragedy
Hoping Shakespeare won't be mad at me
She sips on the poison, there goes her anatomy
I be changing her brain im biology
She's a rich girl a rose, but like every flower, she can wilt and grow
Now her tolerance grows, sitting there doing blow
Messing round not a hoe, freaky girl you never know
Juliet is always letting go

223,"Closer To Free (From ""Party Of Five"")","By 1966, the United States had experienced a recent series of disruptions in several of its major urban Black population centers—Harlem, Watts, Chicago and Detroit Numerous organizations and leaders representing groups of Black people—e.g., SCLC (Martin Luther King, Jr.), the Black Muslims (Elijah Muhammed and Malcolm X), CORE (James Farmer), NAACP (Roy Wilkins)—had repeatedly articulated the causes of these riots or urban rebellions: high unemployment, bad housing, police brutality, poor health care, and inferior educational opportunities. Their consensus on the ills that caused or contributed to the violent explosions in inner cities was confirmed by official investigating bodies such as the Kerner and McCone Commissions. While all groups were generally in agreement on the specific maladies of the society affecting Blacks, they were in disagreement as to the best solution for ending them. The Black nationalists favored separatism; traditional liberals, integration and passage of new legal guarantees; and some of the more activist-oriented demanded ""revolution now."" Amidst this clamor for social justice, the Black Panther Party was formed in Oakland, California, in 1966.
A. Ideology of Revolutionary IntercommunalismThe Party differed from other organizations representing Black and poor persons in several respects. First, the Panthers embraced from the outset an explicitly socialist ideology, which it soon named ""revolutionary intercommunalism."" In essence, the Party acknowledged that it was, despite certain differences, basically socialist or Marxist because it followed the dialectical method and sought to integrate theory and practice. As the founder of the Panthers observed:

                We are not mechanical Marxists and we are not historical                                  materialists. Some people think they are Marxists when they are                         actually following the thoughts of Hegel. Some people think they are                   Marxist-Leninists but they refuse to be creative, and are, therefore,                     tied to the past. They are tied to a rhetoric that does not apply to the                   present set of conditions. They are tied to a set of thoughts that                         approaches dogma...If we are using the method of dialectical                             materialism we don't expect to find anything the same even one                         minute later because ""one minute later"" is history. If things are in a                     constant state of change, we cannot expect them to be the same.                       Words used to describe old phenomena may be useless to describe                   the new. And if we use the old words to describe new events we run                   the risk of confusing people and misleading them into thinking that                     things are static.

This espousal of revolutionary intercommunalism by the BPP obviously influenced the perception of others about it, especially, as will be shown, the federal government. Of equal importance, however, is the effect this ideology has upon the actions of the Party and the decisions of its leadership. Revolutionary intercommunalism provided an important paradigm for interpreting the world, much as a belief in laissez-faire capitalism affects the actions of corporate decision makers who embrace it. Thus, to the BPP, government opposition to its existence was expected as partial confirmation of its raison d' etre. On a more personal level, the BPP leadership felt toward their ideology and its likely opponents that ""truth made you a traitor as it often does in a time of scoundrels.""

""Revolutionary intercommunalism"" not only served to pit the BPP and government law enforcement against each other in ideological struggle, [but also] it gave the Party a perhaps unexpected asset in its struggle for survival. The popular conception of ideology, especially one embracing terminology that seems foreign to traditional democratic politics, is that it is rigid and doctrinaire. Yet to the BPP leadership, its ideology, despite the sound of dogma it may have conveyed to others, served it as a pragmatic methodology for interpreting events. A central tenet of revolutionary intercommunalism, for example, is that ""contradiction is the ruling principle of the universe,"" that everything is in a constant state of transformation. Recognition of these principles gave Party leaders an ability to grow through a self-criticism that many other radical political organizations seemed to lack. Thus, in 1970, Newton could say of the Party:

                In 1966 we called our Party a Black Nationalist Party (BNP). We                       called ourselves Black Nationalists because we thought that                               nationhood was the answer. Shortly after that we decided that what                     was really needed was revolutionary nationalism. That is, nationalism                 plus socialism. After analyzing conditions a little more, we found that                   it was impractical and even contradictory. Therefore we went to a                       higher level of consciousness. We saw that in order to be free we                     had to crush the ruling circle and therefore we had to unite with the                   peoples of the world. So we called ourselves Internationalists. . . We                   sought solidarity with what we thought were the nations of the world.

                But then what happened? We found that because everything is in a                   constant state of transformation, because of the development of                         technology, because of the development of the mass media . . . and                   because of the fact that the United States is no longer a nation but an                 empire, nations could not exist, for they did not have the criteria for                   nationhood. Their self-determination, economic determination, and                     cultural determination has been transformed by the imperialists and                   the ruling circle. They were no longer nations. We found that in order                 to be Internationalists we had to be also Nationalists, or at least                           acknowledge nationhood. Internationalism . . . means the                                   interrelationship among a group of nations. But since no nation                         exists, and since the United States is in fact an empire, it is                               impossible for us to be Internationalists. These transformations and                     phenomena require us to call ourselves ""intercommunalists"" because                 nations have been transformed into communities of the world. The                     Black Panther Party now disclaims internationalism and supports                   intercommunalism.
B. Strategy for Building Community Institutions: The Survival ProgramsA second distinguishing characteristic of the Party has been its specific strategy to achieve revolutionary intercommunalism: the building of ""survival"" or community service programs. The purpose of these programs is to enable people to meet their daily needs by developing positive institutions within their communities and to organize the communities politically around these programs. This, of course, is nothing new when one thinks of certain minority or ethnic communities in the United States, such as the Jews or Chinese. Historically, one way these groups have affected their rise from deprivation is by developing communal associations, ranging from fraternal and religious bodies to political machines. The function of these community associations or institutions has been described by Cloward and Piven as ""provid[ing] a base from which covert ethnic solidarity evolves into the political force required to overcome various forms of class inequality. They are therefore an important device by which the legitimate interests of particular groups are put forward to compete with those of other groups.""

Unfortunately, as Cloward and Piven concede, ""the Black community""—and this was especially true in 1966 when the Party was forming—""lack[ed] an institutional framework in private social welfare [as well as in other institutional areas], and the separatist agencies of other ethnic and religious communities [were] not eager to see this deficiency overcome.... "" Hence the BPP emphasized the importance of its survival programs.

1. The Police Patrols
An early survival program focused on the issue of police brutality, which was a major concern, nationally and in Oakland, California. Applying knowledge of California law, Party founders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale organized police patrols to respond to arrests of citizens that were regularly broadcast over the police officers' short-wave radio. Several Party members equipped with a shortwave radio in a car intercepted the calls, rushed to the scene of the arrest, and, armed with a law book, informed the person being arrested of his constitutional rights. Party members also carried loaded weapons, publicly displayed but not pointed toward anyone, and dressed in leather jackets and berets. The patrol participants were careful to stand no closer than ten feet from the arrest, to stay within the presumption that they were not interfering with the arrest. These initial contacts between Panther patrols and Oakland police resulted in the arrests of Party members and [in] considerable publicity. Media portrayals of these confrontations gave the impression that the Panthers were primarily an armed insurrectionary group. One of the reasons for this distorted image was astutely noted by Erik Erikson:

                You have all seen the now traditional picture of young Huey Newton                   like a latter day American revolutionary with a gun in his hands, held                   not threateningly, but safely pointing upward. To a man of my age, it                   was, not too long ago, almost impossible to imagine black men                           carrying guns openly—black vigilantes, black nightriders in                                automobiles, keeping an eye on (of all things) the law. Most readers                   of the news, of course, did not and do not know that according to                       California law, every citizen then had the right to carry a gun, one                     gun for self-defense and joint defense. But those who created that                     law certainly did not envisage anybody but white men doing so, nor                   did they envisage anybody but potential lawbreakers as the ones to                   be patrolled vigilant citizens in an ill-defined and frontier territory.

                . . . [What the BPP did] was to show how the black man's territory                     has never outlived the frontier state and is still the land of undefined                   laws; and that arbitrary violence in this territory often comes not from                 roving outlaws but from those charged with the enforcement of the                     law. Inclined to disregard the rights of black citizens, they break the                   law under the guise of defending it. [The BPP] made of the police,                     then, the symbol of uniformed and armed lawlessness. But [it] did so                   by ingeniously turning the white man's own imagery (especially dear                   to the American West and the Western) around against the white                       world itself. And in arming [themselves] and [their] brothers against                     that world, [the BPP] emphasized a disciplined adherence to existing                 law. In fact, [the BPP] patrol member traveled equipped not only with                 a gun but also with a law book. The book and the fire—it cannot                         escape us—what an elemental pair of symbols this has been in                         revolts as far removed from each other as that of the Germans in                       Luther's day and that of the Zionists in our own.

The image of Blacks armed for self-defense against police brutality catapulted the Party nationally into the public consciousness and gave an erroneous impression that it advocated armed confrontation. Ironically, however, the single event most responsible for projecting this violent image was itself a pristine case of a group legally petitioning the government for redress of grievances.

The BPP learned in April 1967 of the shooting by Richmond, California police of Denzil Dowell, a twenty-two-year-old Black. Official police accounts claim that the youth was running from the police after they had flagged him down in a stolen car. He reportedly jumped one fence, ran across an automobile junkyard, and was about to jump another fence when an officer shot him. No one claimed that Denzil Dowell was armed. Since he was shot while in the commission of a felony, the police claimed that it was justifiable homicide. But the police account suffered from factual inconsistencies. The victim suffered a hip injury, which made him an unlikely fence-jumper. Moreover, no oil or debris was found on his shoes or clothes, which, had he really run through the automobile junkyard near where he was found, would almost certainly have been present. Finally, several people had witnessed previous threats made by the police to Denzil Dowell, who was apparently viewed by some Richmond law enforcement personnel as a troublemaker.

When BPP members went with Denzil Dowell's family to the sheriff of Contra Costa County to complain about the shooting, they were advised to go to the state capitol in Sacramento and get the law changed that permitted officers to shoot at suspects fleeing the scene of a felony. Party leaders saw this buck-passing as further confirmation of their belief that armed citizen patrols of the police and the arming of the citizenry as guaranteed by the Constitution were the most effective deterrents to excessive use of police force.

Soon after the shooting of Denzil Dowell, an East Bay legislator, Don Mulford, gave the BPP another reason to carry their grievances to the state capitol. Mulford introduced a bill to repeal the law that permitted citizens to carry loaded weapons in public places so long as the weapons were openly displayed. Obviously, the law Mulford sought to repeal was integral to the BPP's police patrols, which was why it was tagged the ""Panther Bill"" in numerous media reports. Passage of Mulford's bill, which the Panthers viewed as almost certain, would make it a crime for a citizen, not otherwise licensed, to carry a loaded weapon in a public place, whether openly displayed or concealed. In response to the introduction of this legislation, the BPP sent a delegation to the capitol to protest this attempted disarming of the citizenry. The delegation carried loaded rifles and shotguns, which they publicly displayed. They entered the state capitol, a public place, to make their protest by delivering Executive Mandate No. 1.

The legislature responded to this protest by promptly passing the law, which was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. But the gathering of armed Black men on the capitol steps was photographed and published in newspapers and on television throughout the nation. These photographic representations served as a stimulus for Party popularity and growth among young Blacks, hostility by the government, and fear by much of the white citizenry recently racked by a series of Black urban riots.

What never became clear to the public, largely because it was always deemphasized in the media, was that the armed self-defense program of the Party was just one form of what Party leaders viewed as self-defense against oppression. The Party had always urged self-defense against poor medical care, unemployment, slum housing, underrepresentation in the political process, and other social ills that poor and oppressed people suffer. The Panther means for implementing its concept of self-defense was its various survival programs, symbolized best by the police patrols and the free breakfast program for school children. In addition to these programs, however, the Party early initiated health clinics providing free medical and dental service, a busing program to take relatives of prisoners on visiting days, and an escort and transportation service for residents of senior citizen housing projects, as well as a clothing and shoe program to provide for more of the needs of the local community. It was these broad-based programs, including the free food programs where thousands of bags of groceries were given away to the poor citizens of the community, that gave the Party great appeal to poor and Black people throughout the country. For one of the first times since the organized slave rebellions before the Civil War, Blacks were responding to an organization that tried to build community institutions and did so under the banner of a political ideology that directly challenged democratic capitalism.

2. Use of Democratic Reforms by the Party to Build Community Institutions
The Panthers, despite their explicit repudiation of democratic capitalism as a system that was inherently incapable of permitting Black and poor people from enjoying full and equal participation in it, did not eschew democratic means of reform, nor did they discourage Black capitalism. To the contrary, from its very inception, the Party utilized existing legal machinery in order to bring about social change and encouraged indigenous Black financial enterprises. In addition to the legal police patrols already mentioned, the Party frequently filed civil law suits seeking relief for its members, wand Black and poor people generally, from various injustices.18 The Panthers also turned to the ballot box, first by running members for mayor and city council in Oakland in 1972 and 1974, and comings surprisingly close to victory. In 1976, Party involvement was admittedly credited by two successful Black candidates for their elections, to the offices of Mayor of Oakland and Supervisor of Alameda County, the first two Black persons to be elected to these positions in Oakland's history, despite a sizeable Black population that had resided there since World War II. Moreover, the Party incorporated some of its main survival programs such as its Intercommunal Youth Institute and Seniors Against a Fearful Environment (SAFE). The Youth Institute, a school for more than one hundred Party and other children from the first through the eighth grades, was incorporated as the Educational Opportunities Corporation. SAFE was an escort and busing program in which young Blacks took seniors out into the community—a combination of Black and gray power that to some extent provides both groups what they need and desire—people power. The device of incorporation allowed both survival programs to avail themselves of tax-deductible contributions and some limited government benefits.

The Party also advocated growth of indigenous community businesses, even though they were capitalistic. This is because the Party recognized that Black capitalism has come to mean to many people Black control of another one of the institutions in t thee community. This positive quality of Black capitalism should, the Party felt, be encouraged.

Since the people see Black capitalism in the community as Black control of local
institutions, this is a positive characteristic because the people can bring more direction and focus to the activities of the capitalist. At the same time, the Black capitalist who has the interest of the community at heart will respond to the needs of the people because this is where his true strength lies. So far as capital [in] general is concerned, the black capitalist merely has the status of a victim because the big capitalists have the skills, make the loans„ and in fact control the Black capitalist. If he wants to succeed in his enterprise, the Black capitalist must turn to the community because he depends on them to make his profits. He needs this strong community support because he cannot become independent of the control of the corporate capitalists who control the large monopolies.

The Black capitalist will be able to support the people by contributing to the survival programs of the Black Panther Party. In contributing to such programs he will be able to help build the vehicle which will eventually liberate the Black community. He will not be able to deliver the people from their problems, but he will be able to help build the strong political machine which will serve as a revolutionary vanguard and guide the people in their move toward freedom.

A practical application of the Party's view toward Black capitalism and the use of legal means of reform occurred in Oakland, California, in 1971. A group of small Black-owned retail liquor stores and taverns asked the BPP for support in a boycott against Mayfair Supermarkets because Mayfair purchased alcoholic beverages from companies that excluded Black truck drivers. The BPP joined in the boycott, and within a period of days, Mayfair ended its discriminatory practices. The Party then asked the group of Black businessmen who had solicited Party help to make a nominal continuing contribution to one or more survival programs. The businessmen, who had approached the Party initially through an organization called the California State Package Store and Tavern Owners Association (Cal-Pak), declined to contribute except via a single gift. The Party rejected Cal-Pak's offer, stating,

                . . . a continuing trickle of support is more important to the community                 than a large, once-only hush mouth gift. We will not be paid off; we                   will not be quiet. We will not go away. . . Why should the Black                           community nourish a Black profiteer who has no concern for his                       brother?

It was considered important to the Party's concept of building community institutions that contributions from the Black businesses not only be continuing, but that they come from the association representing them. This would, in the Party's view, constitute participation through a united front and build Cal-Pak as a community institution along with the survival programs. Since the Party had been asked for assistance in the Mayfair boycott by representatives of Cal-Pak, it also followed logically that Cal-Pak should support the survival programs. When Cal-Pak refused, the Party called for a boycott of the liquor stores of the president of Cal-Pak, Bill Boyette, and picketed the two liquor stores he owned. Five months later, Cal-Pak and the Party reached an agreement. Congressman Ronald Dellums, who helped negotiate the settlement, announced at a press conference in January 1972 that:

                . . . an agreement has been reached of great importance to all of the                 people in the Bay Area and, in particular, the Black population of this                 area. This agreement, between the Black Panther Party and the Ad                   Hoc Committee for Promotion of Black Business, officially ends the                   boycott of Boyette's Liquor Stores by the Black Panther Party. . . The                 United Fund of the Bay Area, Inc., sponsored and created by the Ad                 Hoc Committee for the Promotion of Black Business and the Cal-Pak                 Liquor Dealers, has already begun the task of collecting funds from                   Black businesses and individuals for programs of special need in                       the Black community. Operating as a nonprofit social vehicle for the                   Black community, this new organization will make disbursements to                     various significant organizations in the Black community on a regular                 and continuing basis. Among the programs that will benefit are the                     survival programs of the Black Panther Party.

This willingness by the Party to use democratic means of reform and to support Black capitalism was criticized by some as inconsistent with the Panther ideology of revolutionary intercommunalism. This is partly because progressive people quite correctly observe that ""It is very clear, upon reflection, what function law serves within any culture. It protects the culture's ideology. Under capitalism it protects property, the men who own it and guard it."" From this observation, it is only a brief inferential step to the conclusion that, because law is a product and perpetuator of corporate interests in this country, it cannot be a force for significant socioeconomic change. But while this conclusion is logical in a mechanistic-sense, it is illogical, and therefore wrong, in a
dialectical sense:

                According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately                         determining element in history is the production and reproduction of                   real life... [I]f somebody twists this into saying that the economic                         element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition                     into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase. The economic                           situation is basis, but the various elements of the super-structure:                       political forms of the class struggle . . . constitutions established by                     the victorious class . . . judicial forms, had even the reflexes of all                       these actual struggles in the brains of the participants . . . also                           exercise their influence upon the course of the historical struggles                     and in many cases preponderate in determining their form.

In sum, the Panthers combined a unique blend of elements that set them apart from traditional civil rights and minority organizations: a revolutionary ideology that argued for the necessity of fundamental socioeconomic change, a practical series of survival programs that served the community and fostered institutional growth and consciousness, and a willingness to employ creative legal means within the democratic system to achieve their ends. It was these unique elements that made the Panthers popular with many Blacks and, at the same time, a nemesis to the federal government.",Huey P.

(Go ahead)
See you can't just do it
(Go ahead)
You gotta do it well

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Look, body language is the kinda talk I'm fluent in
Why don't you stop talking 'bout it and come do it then?
Written on your face, that ""Yeah I'm tryna do it"" grin
Event planning, we just need a spot to do it in
Heading to engagements, head behind the Range tints
Fruits of my labor, edible arrangements
It get a little messy, sweater new, Jays mint
She say when she done with me I better go and change them
Fuck the sweater, I don't know no fuckin' better (Whatchu mean?)
Y'all don't get it, I don't know no fuckin' better (Word)
Then this right here, shawty right there
Still givin' ol' boy nightmares
And I heard your ex hate it, that's why my texts stated
Last night was a movie and it was X-Rated
Flick called Wet, it only gets better
Tonight we make the sequel and call that shit Wetter

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
(Go ahead) Go ahead
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right (Nice)
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
(She represent Queens, I was raised out in Brooklyn)

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Body language is the only talk he fluent in
He knew it was going down when he flew me in
Anything that I got on he wanna do me in
Now all these non-discrete bitches wanna do me in
Uh, Gold AP on me
He know all his niggas wanna put the D on me
Even Dr. Dre went and put the B on me
But my pussy so exclusive, limited edition
You know niggas love pretty bitches with ambition
Bees on the keys, never go in the ignition
B-B-But when I ride it, do it to precision
I could tell that he trippin', every time that I slip in
When he 'bout to cum I start to kiss his neck
I let him score, but we ditch the ref'
When we going out, we gotta ditch the press
Ah man, I got his bitch depressed

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
(She represent Queens, I was raised out in Brooklyn)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj & Fabolous]
I'ma call you big daddy and scream your name
Only if you have me drippin' like candy paint
So what you sayin? I give it to you right, give it to you left
Make it last forever, Keith Sweat, have you outta breath
Mmmm, daddy slow down a bit
You acting like you never been downtown and shit
I need a baller laid back while he watch this thing bounce
Buying them designer bags, put money in my account
No doubt, I'm the player that they're talking about
Got that good shit, even in a drought
If you gon' do it, do it for real
And if they ask how I'm doin' tell 'em doin' it well

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
Go ahead
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
Go ahead (Go ahead)
Fuck me like you know somebody else ain't fuckin' me right
I'ma kiss your body from your head down to your toes
Any time you want it you just let a nigga know (Just let me know)

[Chorus: Trey Songz & (Fabolous)]
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it
We gon' do it real good
And we gon' do it, do it, do it, do it

226,Don't Wanna Lose You,"[Verse 1:]
Sometimes it's hard to make things clear
I know when to face the truth
And I know when the moment is here
I'll open my heart and show you inside

My love has no pride
I feel with you
I've got nothing to hide
So open your eyes and see who I am
And not who you want for me to be
I am only myself, myself

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow
I don't wanna lose you now forever

Baby, I finally found the courage
To stand my ground
But if you want me
I'll be around forever

[Verse 2:]
We all make mistakes
We all lose our way
But we stood the test of time
And I hope that's the way it will stay

It's all up to you to tell me to go
'Cause it won't be me to walk away
When you're all that I know
And I know that

[Repeat Chorus:]

I don't wanna lose you
Lose you now
We're gonna get through somehow

227,Renee,"[Verse 1]
Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders, ""excuse me miss, but can I get your name?""
She said, my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?
She said if you want, so yo, we started talking
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking
I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts because I heard that's for silly stunts""
I said nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 2]
So now we sitting on the train
Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy cd's
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said Cheeks, do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said, alright well I'mma roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chatting
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted yo to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
Cause on the real this is where it's at

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you""
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee because Renee uses Code Two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's""
I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ayy yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po-nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck, I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone""
I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears

232,Amish Paradise,"[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

[Verse 2]
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

[Bridge]
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise

[Verse 3]
Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops and traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites

233,My Maria,"[Verse 1]
My Maria, don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her, when she's around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria, the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

[Chorus]
My Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

[Verse 2]
My Maria, there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back, my peace of mind
Gypsy lady, you're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

[Bridge]
She is the sunlight when skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

234,5 O'Clock,"[Hook: Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 1: T Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me textses
Like, ""Boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (aw, aw, aw)
And then ask me kindly (aw, aw, aw)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And yet we wake up singing the same song

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
""What is he doing? What is he doing?""
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
And you texting me like, ""I'mma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh, and my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (worry 'bout nothing)
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me (no, no, no)
And then ask me kindly (no, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club
For me to leave here with one of them, that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib
(It’s 5′O Clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause I’m sure you’re the best
You’re the one, so I let you, thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like “damn, babe you woke me up”
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing thats coming up

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

[Chorus]
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Verse 2]
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

[Chorus 2]
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

[Bridge]
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

[Verse 3]
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it

That we don't even care

And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest

Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering
All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold
Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)

You told her about me
She filled you with fear
Some kind of sin
How can you turn
Denying the fire
Lover I burn
Let me in

Open your back door
I just need to touch you
Once more
Oh, oh...

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe

I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over

Oh...
Oh...

I know you're confused
I know that you're shaken
You think we'll be lost
Once we begin
I know you're weak
I know that you want me
Lover don't speak
Let me in

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe

I want to come over

Between love and hate

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Three in the morning, my pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, you're starting to wonder
Where I'm at, what I'm doing and all that
I could have called, but instead I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three, I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know to set things straight
That's it's a thin line between love and hate

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember, early December
You told me, ""Don't come over
Because of the cold and rainy weather""
But *knock, knock, knock*

It's five in the morning, and you're still trying to get through
Sweating the Frost for hanging out with the crew
But baby, if this keeps going on
I came and just like I came, I'm gone
We been through, thick and thin, good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I knew you'd trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line between love and gate

245,I Will Survive,"[Intro]
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin' how you did me wrong
And I grew strong, and I learned how to get along

[Verse 1]
And so you're back, from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey

[Verse 2]
It took all the strength I had, not to fall apart
Just tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin' in and just expect me to be free
Well now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live, and I've got all my love to give
And I'll survive, I will survive, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on now go, walk out the door
Just turn around now, 'cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

[Chorus]
Oh no, not I, I will survive

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don’t like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya!

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty Gs a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thicken
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now
...And some other shit

247,Heartspark Dollarsign,"Time stops when the whispers blare
The voices drop hard, but the eyes still stare
The world resolves into a death's head grin
Because I walk with pride with a black girlfriend

My mom said not to bring her around
'Cause she's black, my family would put her down
I'll break the white-trash ties that bind
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind

She said, she said
""Forget the fact that I don't look like you.""
She said, she said
""You're possessed with a power bigger than the pain.""

Time stops when we lie so close
In my room where we share what no one knows
From the day that we start until the day that we end
I know, I know, I know now
We will never find a place where we could just fit in
Me and my black girlfriend

I devoted my whole life to rockin' mics gettin' crowds lifted
Put my pants on backwards 'cause I wanted to be different
I keeps 'em with a crease, timepiece Bertolucci
House full of honeys sportin' Gucci, cuttin' coochie

Macadocious to the most, brown, sexy, slim
Setter of trends, known for making dividends
And millions of people jump, jump, jump, jump...

Now who choose to be the next nigga to step, get deleted by Def
Undefeated, ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke, yolkin' niggas up by the collar
Follow me 'cause my dollars makin' more sense than Common
Robbin' you for your money and your diamonds
Endangerin' your species
More Than A Woman like The Bee Gees
No remorse, steady smokin' plenty grass (let it go)
And let Da Brat commence to be the baddest hoe

[Chorus 2X: Mack Daddy & Da Brat]
Well, baby, roll me a mic and let me smoke 'til I'm high
If you ever seen me rock then you know that I
Live and die for the things I do
Slang I use, breakin' down mics, and destroyin' crews

Yachts is by the sea, big party (twelve until)
See I'm the Daddy of the Mack and at the top of world
I chill, keep it real
My field of work consists of that

I wouldn't trade it, to me, it's nothin' better
Wakin' up when I wanna, sportin' Jay Boogie leather
Autographs, bubble baths, five-star hotels
Rollin' wit' a click super thick and everybody's gettin' mail

[Verse 4: Mr. Black]
Take off the safety and face me
Gun powder chowder for real
The last nigga figured to ever make it off the hill
But still rhymes rock like coke that smoke
And I'm in effect with a Tec that got a infrared scope
Smackin' those actin' tough as Tinactin
Fall up in yo' hood increase your brain with the Mac-10
Stack ends, seventeens on the Benz
And burner by my thigh in case these niggas wan' die

You wanna be my main squeeze, baby
Don'tcha? You want to give me what I need, baby
Won'tcha picture life as my wife? Just think
Full-length mink, fat X and O links
Bracelets to match, conversation was all that
Showed you the safe combinations and all that
Guess you could say you'se the one I trusted
Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot: you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got
'Nother intricate plot, the bitch said I raped her
""Damn, why she wanna stick me for my paper?""
My Moschino hoe, my Versace hottie
Come to find out you was fuckin' everybody
You knew about me, the fake ID
Cases in Virginia, body in D.C
Woe! Oh is me - that's what I get for trickin'
Pay my own bail, commence the ass-kickin'
Kick in the door, wavin' the .44
All you heard was ""Poppa don't hit me no more!""

Niggas, better grab a seat
Grab on your dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than the pussy of a bitch 6 feet
Stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young bitch from the street, guaranteed to stay down
Used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now I'm Billboard bound, niggas press to hit it
Play me like a chicken, thinkin' I'm pressed to get it
Rather do the killin' than the stick-up juxs
Rather count a million while you eat my pussy
Push me to the limit, get my feelings in it
Get me open while I'm cummin' down your throat
Then, you wanna be my main squeeze, nigga
Don'tcha? You wanna lick between my knees, nigga
Don'tcha want to see me whippin' your 3 down the Ave?
Blow up spots on bitches because I'm mad
Break up affairs, lick shots in the air
You get vexed and start swinging everywhere
Me shifty? Now you wanna pistol whip me
Pull out your 9 while I cock on mine
Yeah, what nigga? I ain't got time for this
So what, nigga? I'm not tryin' to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel 9 boots
Things that make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards sayin' ""I apologize""
Is you with me? How could you ever deceive me?
But payback's a bitch, motherfucker, believe me
Nah, I ain't gay, this ain't no lesbo flow

Scoop called the doctor and he said (I want to get high!)
Milky hits, water bubble, lungs blow up
I'm the duke of errl, baby pouring shatter like it's syrup
Wrap her, then a white girl, lights swirl, glass tip
Pussy's can't hang, lights out, catnip

Yellow hash, wax hits, ash tray 20 roaches
Thousand dollar glass, yeah i'm first class toasting, to the good life
In my S-Class Benz floating, ask Demrick how I get down
I grew up by the ocean, where the pounds go for cheap
And them local girls are hoeing, they asked me where i'm going
To the top with this bass shit, new strain alert
Here you go taste it, you know we get the paper
Jars with the different flavors, wiz khalifa papers
Hardcore, trippy vapors, you got a bitch to pay ya
All my girls are money makers, I'm in Jamaica
Drug money on my kitchen table, blowing

252,Scary Kisses,"There's not much of a trick to playing safely baby
People do it every day
You can see them living sensibly with lots of care
Lonely in a cautious way

You be alone for me
I'll be alone for you
One and one people alone make two
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all
Then take no chance at all

I would rather sit here by myself
Then settle down with someone safe and sound
I kinda like a little trouble every now and then
Someone with enough to break ground

You take a look for me
I'll take a look for you
We'll find it's not so bad it's just new
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news
We will just get up again start over on the count of ten
And if we scar or if we break
It will be our own mistake
Put it down to what we know
Then have another go

And take another chance
And just begin again
Run your finger through the flame
And i will do the same
Together we will fall
Together we will rise
Together we will do everything
But compromise

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news

I still can't quite remember where I was

See the Lord is watching everything I does
But you know that I do
I told you I was made

And you know that it's true

I'm sorry that I can't be your Superman
But you can be my Lois Lane
Always get you in trouble cuz everybody know his name
My nigga said the pussy crazy -- Made him go insane
Had him running circles chasing pictures in the pouring rain
Watch where you're walking
His soles are pushing to the deep end
Pop you out a seed and let you see him on the weekend
Call it smart, some niggas say follow your heart
I think father that pay for buckets should be farther a part
Well who said that she was giving you that on-the-low?
You caught a look and I coulda swore that she was trying to go
She had that little hair tied, the bow creeping on it
And doe creeping and now she's got you by the door
Forget the guns, you know those girls will try to get you by surprise
Get a meal out you, I ain't talking burgers and fries

Yo, before this battle was locked, they told me you've been on the road for a minute
Well, I'm here to dead it, K-Shine, so you should know I'm committed
So, bitch, don't try to take me light, 'cause I ain't come to play, aight?
I don't give a fuck about ya zip line, I ain't afraid of heights
I've been nice
And tonight we got a lot to discuss 'bout
If you lose your composure, you gettin' knocked smooth the fuck out
I'm not gon' take the fuss route, them hands gon' get deadly
Bitch I will give a hook to Shine good as Barrington Levy
Better respect me, or yo' ass gettin' left wit' a swole jaw
If Eric get involved, then that's just a problem for both, dawg
And see my shooter barely tax, he'll pull up and smoke y'all
One Franklin got him thinkin' FX, that's Snowfall
I told y'all, but now this jerk gotta see
'Cause as far as your last plan, it fit Ness (Planet Fitness), but that don't work out wit' me
See, Rex, I know you love your son and such
But I don't give a fuck if K Dot, put him in Power, his role still is a bum to us
Nothin' tough, I don't give a fuck if you really foul
You hear me, slime?
This shit all 'bout respect, so give me mine
Or I'll be at ya new crib wit' the semi, have plenty flyin'
I turn that stick and get Shine through a window like mini blinds
Bitch, he dyin'
Like why y'all feel that I'd be bothered?
There's no way I lose to K, like a hygiene problem
What y'all forgot how I shatter dudes?
Ooh, that drives a nigga to kill, and I'm feelin' like Jamie Foxx in Collateral
Who's gassin' you?
Or got you really believin' you wit' the beef
Cause braggin' how y'all been gang-bangin' don't mean shit to me
I got him in the click my G
So if I gotta bring out the Hidden Colors you'll see, the nigga's history
That flag shit don't matter
Send half my Locs at him or get touched by a brim, you'll be Math in the Dose battle
So you better keep it calm though, midget
The .9 point will lay K in the ER, I go Rondo wit' it
So brang them bitches, the D and T (DMT) just gon' end up smoke partna
Rain'll (Raina) get shot for gettin' involved like Ghost daughter
Shine dyin' once an old shell catch him
I call a thot and have a blond curl Top, that's Odell Beckham
I don't respect him
Cause that gang shit you claim, will get me steamed
Cause we know you only on it the moment you witcha team
Be alone 'round some Locs and watch how quick he switch the scene
Out that do' this Billy hoe ain't gon' bang, I'm Sidney Deane
I mean we seen his type, battle rap hype like cold bluff
You got hooked and pulled from under a whip, you a tow truck
Man, so what you hit lil' dude, we know
Gamble tonight, roll a Gangsta's Paradise (pair of dice) and I'll show you I'm not Cooley, yo (Coolio)
Fuck who he know, and I hope he offended
Oh you niggas lookin' for smoke? Well you know we dispensing
Shooter for hire
If it's doe to be spent then give me a number
The gun on this bitch's head, like on Don't Be A Menace
He gon' get finished, then I'm back to this paper
Cause my concern is havin' checks to burn, I'm a Kaepernick hater
You ain't no gangsta, the bangers around you just add hype
But I know Bloods that you can't get right, but that's life
Y'all better tell him get his mind right
It's like my dream the green beam, and I pray to get Shine in the lime light
Ain't tryin' to fight, so I'm posted wit' a big ass gun
I'll smack ya mama, tell her to go get her bitch ass son
You get ya crew involved, them niggas gon' drop dead witcha
Better pray you a better shot or you can pop lead quicker
If I get shot, well, that's when I get slicker
After the Is-He-Dead-Kick, my head lift - BAOW - not yet, nigga!
I'm wit' the hitters who don't give a fuck about K actin'
Always hype like he ready to fight, straight snatchin'
Now as far as rap, ain't no rematch with Tay happenin'
They ain't really handin' you Roc(k), bitch this a play action
Like, why would Smack throw Roc at him?
When I'm up here 'Walkin' On son Shine (Sunshine)' like the old pop record
You not better, I'm the best on this stage
Even if T and Eric write (Wright) for you, it's still an easy (Eazy) death with ya AIDS
Nigga it's Cave
Niggas in rap don't want no beef
Less we really be wit' the straps, we can drum roll streets
Kick in his crib, catch this bum hoe 'sleep
I'll burst mine then Earth Shine, like Genesis Chapter 1, Verse 3

Got the stock in (stocking), finna turn somethin' into fish nets
And it caught ya motherfuckin' (mother fuckin') son: incest

Get stretched, wit'cha cap blew (blue): Blistex

Here's the creep part, arm on the chest like a retard
Knife, turnin' like I'm tryin' to make the key start
Tell Shark City, I want the big fish on blades...now they Street Sharks!
He got one of two options
It's either you get shot or you get shot
Same proposal as before, I'm puttin' Roc(k) in a box
FN auto sittin' on the side of the drop
The other grip on the bottom like hospital socks
Soon as it Blow, Pop, it's pushin' through his top
I drop his whole mug, like I was pickin' up the coffee when it's hot
This nigga shocked, waitin' for the guy that's come for Roc
Puttin' together the grill on Ave like a cookout for the block
You can check, every bar code like a Soundscan
Pump, push a (Pusha) brother in a church like Pharrell man
100 pellets, 25 cents from a buck like I sell stamps
Then take the same route on Ave, like the mailman
It's no lackin' anywhere
Nigga I don't care who they peeps
I'm generous with these meals (mils) like, ""Who ain't eat?!""
Chopper, split him from the waist before they move they feet
Got Ave rollin' both ways like a two-way street
Please! Ave, 'Lyt and Roc, they gettin' shot for tryin' to play me
I'll Roc(k) 'Lyt like a salt lamp, but you gon' die shady

Cause that's a head shot on Ave in the broad daylight (Daylyt) and tell the Roc, ""Goodbye baby"" (rockabye baby)
Tell ya boss, ""Try again"", these geeks can't bury me.""

Gun button on Ave, then complete they legacy
Cause this one for Roc(k) like a Jeep Grand Cherokee
This where that game change
You better keep Roc(k) out the watch like a Plain Jane
Or get the latest, got the nickel plated like a name chain
Beasley, give me the signal like a lane change
I stop the blast, then get to rockin' (Roc and) Ave like Cave Gang
Two knives, put 'em in a Different World, but it's the same stain
Butterflies, flip in front of his eyes like Dwayne Wayne
You wanna know what I notice?
This nigga's a bitch too
Where was you when Brizz broke the bottle for Holla and his crew?
Oh let me guess, you wasn't in the buildin' so shit's smooth
Or you would've noticed the door like the rent's due
Bitch move
Her pussy ass wanted this shit too
But leave the stage, freezin' on the Cave like an igloo
I'm a wacko, easin' off of tobacco and Sig' (cig') blew
Tell that Guardian Of your Galaxy talk to the stick, it's Groot
But this tool, I got it down to the T
Fit description, knife, like goals of achievement, I'm stickin' wit' it
You get the vision? A real nigga vs a hoe, different isn't it?
Yeah I thought the same thing, man Cave shouldn't have no bitches in it
That's a Juice shot-

Let's get to business, zip him up let's go

[Round 2: Ave]
My nigga what's wit' this persona like you really want drama out in the field?
Well ain't nothin' 'bout you G, K (UGK), let's just be Trill
I mean the frontin' gotta stop
'Cause you played Geronimo, but you a blank domino
You don't get points without the Dots
We can tell it off top you scary, that's why I'm not too worried
Shine ain't real this is costume jewelry
Y'all think I care he say his pistol play heavy?
My shootin' Method with the shotgun is like the bartender's in Belly
Tell him ""Get at me"", but I bet you he chill if he clothes line him
Or the strap lay Shine helmet up, he a coal miner
When it's time to ride, it's no speakin', this Teairra Mari
Meaning this bitch gon' sing 'til the dome leakin'
What we on? Beefin'?
Well ain't no need for no talkin' fraud
Your team step I slide up wit' arm like Stomp The Yard
Cause I don't really need the grip for dude
Trust me, the fist will do clown, I'll put the hammy down, I know these fit for you
And I want smoke wit' them bitches too
I handle scrappin'
Oh you think cause I'm fat I'm a slacker, my hands is lackin'
I'm so fast wit' the action, that even if he bob he (Bobby) hit and niggas ain't even know it, like Janet Jackson
What's crackin'? You really 'bout action? Play gutter
Machete from Rawsteen skin Shine like shaved butter
Wait, I ain't no blade tucker, I'd rather grab a tool and put a Harlem dude down wit' the deuce like Ma$e cover
But in case you bring ya whole crew nigga
I get the big chop, MAC on the side like a soul food dinner
Then once I body all these nerds, I'm baggin' product to serve
An O.Z. by the A.R., K, I'm Marty Byrde
Cause yeah we got it off the curve, if it's there we at it
Y'all think cause y'all see him flaggin' wit' that red he savage
Soon as he snatched by the FEDS he panic
Tellin' type, bet he give up all the rights like a deadbeat parent
See he be scammin' in the worst way Top
Soon as he caught the Beans spillin' in court like the first State Prop'
You gotta watch them, when the pressure increase nigga's front But as men you (menu) never change, Chinese restaurants
We was posted wit' a product to sell
Somethin' about me, Gronkowski, I feel like the biggest target for 12
But oh well, we grind heavy, from powder to the Mary
And with pill shit we had more scripts than Tyler Perry
But he's scary
This talk like he heavy, just rap
There's even fake fives in yo' crew
No not the Rex dap, but PC
Is you kiddin' me G's?
So I guess you gon' tell me P(ee) wit' the blood like a kidney disease
My nigga, please
Y'all not tough, get popped up, another body that's gon' add to the mil' (meal) like potlucks

Nigga Shine tryin' to get signed throw that slut a whole mil'
That's ya baby? You love her crazy?
The fuck is your deal?
That bitch shady, I'll have her runnin' back to Buffalo Bills
Man get real, that's why if I beef with these maricóns, I just catch 'em while they at ya new crib
Shotty chrome, I clap D, Top and T when they think we prolly gone
I catch Boom walkin' out halfway, like Ah Di home
Nah he grown, so this how you gotta talk to K-Shine
And I'm only talkin' like this with the hopes he cross the line
Cause we buyin' all the toolies in town
Soon as the Tre dropped off, put it to work, I got Furious Styles
This how Ave really go, so if it's static let me know
I throw a jab to this fag and drop his ass to the flo'
I mean he asked for the smoke, so hey, pick yourself up and skate, like in the MJ 'Bad' video
Like really tho', he asleep as soon as he hit wit' these
Meanin' all that bumpin' (bump in) ya lip, transmitted disease
And please bring them to the war, I look forward to shootin' more
I got a problem with all the ex (X) niggas, I'm Insecure
Time man

He seen Rain and got turned into mist, he evaporatin'
TECs, leave him empty his shit, it's evacuatin'
Fifth, got it talkin' for me, man it's advocatin'
But the Eagle will take the head off the boss, the D(ecapitatin')
This will check, a person's will like a testament
Nothin' but a check for him
Cause I was on the road with the best of them
But stop to whip on Ave like pedestrians
Here's a tip see, hammered on Ave like the Mexicans
Or see three (C3) straps on Ave like a lesbian
Number of shells on Ave like it's evidence
MAC 10 it (tenant) build in (buildin') on Ave like a resident
I keep heaters, these seekers turn to deep sleepers, unaffectionate
I ain't even gotta squeeze Nina, Glock excuse
That Tommy blew like ""I ain't cheat, Keisha!""
Have every whip on one side of Ave like the street cleaners
Whatchu know about it? Runnin' outta food like the .38
And you gotta feed it shells from ya son .9

Nigga I was tryin' to knock a piece off her
Standin' behind the Canon (cannon) on Ave like a reporter
Each corner, waitin' on Ave like a beat walker
I eliminate characters, I'm tryin' to make the Tweet shorter
Shark City, right? Well now he in deep water
100 shots, 25 sent (cent) from a buck like three quarters
Beam on ya, but ya niggas get it before it's sold out; pre-ordered
Where Ave live? Nigga I'll pull up to his crib wit' a chop' to meet you
Spot the people, searchin' through the blind like Ray when he dropped the needle
Shark City get a whiff of these paws, he got cerebral
Froze when it spark, bust the nose under the Shark: Dory in Finding Nemo
You think you gon' be my big brother Rock and get away wit' it?
Oh now it's time to thief go
Pots hittin' Sticky fingers (Fingaz) on Ave like Tyrone locked wit' Debo
They watchin' me, it's State Property if I drop the Sigel

[Round 3: Ave]
It's about time somebody came in here and shake up this shit
I told niggas I wanted smoke, nobody safe from these hits
And I promise you I won't miss, unless it get to the list
Cause I'll address them real quick the get right back to this bitch
Ayo Cal', we need to have a sit down, fuck the delay
Whatever bread you 'bout to charge, I'm quite sure I know Smack will pay
Aye you won't even get a round
Wait, coin tosses count, so skip that, think Dipset, I'm puttin' up .40 Cal
Yo Hitman, you already know that we been rockin'

{Intermission because of smoke alarms going off. Apparently fans can smoke in this venue.}

Bitch it's whatever, y'all must forgot that Ave that cold
So I'm takin' down every star like Grand Theft code
Now he the next one to slaughter
Soon as I hung the call up, the goal? Body shine, I'm Bruce Leroy out the water
You'se a good talker, but I ain't worried too much
Cause I'm strapped, aye these (80's) babies come at .30 and up
Bro we was doin' all the dirt that we could
Even if that meant we had to spark plugs to keep work in the hood
What's good, get it understood that I never play
So if it's rap, let it be that, and that's where it better stay
Cause if I let Beretta's spray, I swear that I'm stretchin' K
The wrong move gon' have them trippin' on you, think [?]
But in here if it escalate, that's a chin break cuz
I get Shine wit' one hand, that's the MJ glove
And I don't do no fake grudge, so if it turn to get real
Hope you can back yo' shit up more than Percocet pill
We in the field, cause we know just how to handle them streets
We was scramblin' tryin' to manage nigga, damn a PG
Niggas tryin' to make sure they families eat
The trap works, you're Nature? Rap first like it's 'Banned From TV'
See we was at it, break down savage to get the ends
No 12's, sandwich bags, no razors, safety pins
Whatever to make 'em spend
Had to get the fiends coppin', cause that's chips on the first, we EBT shoppin'
Bruh this block shit ain't nothin' new
Do a straight month or two then slowly peel back on the corner, just like a Lunchable
You wanna dump the tools? No problem we hitters
Have mil's (Millz) givin' Shine rounds before RBE nigga
We some gorillas, think shit's sweet wit' us? You off ya thoughts a little
Cause thinkin' I'ma play ain't gon' work, yeah I'm wit' all the bull (audible)
I'll have ya teeth leakin' bruh, then draw and throw three to ya
But either way you'll bleed in this order (disorder); hemophilia
But see this thug shit in ya verses, I don't think it's this person
Cause you too dumb to see the fame, you done surface
Why you claimin' shit that ain't even worth it?
My niggas tryin' to get F words off they records like the radio versions
But you ain't learnin', you one of them niggas that need the proof
You one of them niggas that ain't gon' get it until you [?]
See that's why I blame Mook, if he'd have played his position
There wouldn't be no line between Dots, you see the vision boy? We different
If I get in some shit, I'ma handle mine
You the nigga that's gon' ride cause you know that ya man's behind
Y'all standin' there like it's fine
Til y'all in jail later, with ya body hooked to chains and a box like Hellraiser
See that's why I hate the niggas your'e type
Cause you ain't gon' brawl, but them niggas might
You ain't gon' fall but they gon' get life
You gon' move on like y'all weren't even tight
Hesitate to pick up a call, view a nigga or write
Ya light pussy, and I hear you reppin' Treyway out this bitch?
Tryin' to prove you this gangsta so they can think that you legit
Boy I think you fake as shit
I had K face some Crips now he claimin' them 20's on him Dayday at the whip
Oh I can take the hit
Make him a target, niggas drop him wit' one round
And then it's to Gate Of The Gardens
But nah, my name ain't been shit as of lately
I might shoot what K see (Casey) and the knee (Anthony) and get rid of the baby
Bitch is he crazy? I told you, ""Fix my plate"", right Smack?
Cause they been sleepin', it's time I bring my state right back
Don't give a fuck about these sucka niggas, they type wack
Cause I'm a nigga outta Norfolk, straight like that

[Round 3: K-Shine]
Yo Ave, you went from never havin' a rhyme in yo' life
To stealin' every rhyme in yo' life
Boy this 'bout to be the rhyme of ya life
Another six foot nigga wit' a (Death Wish)
Nah, you worried 'bout the polls to ya battles
I'm worried 'bout my poles when I'm sparkin' 'em
You worried 'bout the shit you write
Nigga I'm worried about my rights when I'm charged wit' them
You worried 'bout the lead in ya pencil
Nigga I'm worried 'bout the lead in these cartridges
You steal nigga, I steel niggas
And these the words that's harmin' them (homonym)
Revolver spin, bullets hittin' nerves, this finna bother him
Get it shakin', I'll him disease like Parkinson
Spar wit' him? I'll open up his sweater on a card again (cardigan)
So advertise meant (advertisement), pickin' the right spots like marketin'
I got my self esteem, buildin' up like confidence
He got a part of this, into yourself like a Narcissist
About 100 bodies, a nigga lost count
I just know ya seed, he was targetin'
So he will be somewhere in that number when ya son comes to Shine
Like when the Saint Go Marching In
Nah, fuck that, I got a colder mission
Laser, I planted with the star like a solar system
Then I peel (pill), like a pharmacy with no prescription
Chest shot, he ran into his homie wit' the shoulder dippin'
Then it's head shots to both, 'til they face charges together like they co-defendants
Hold a minute, like a bitch turned dyke, I've over niggas
Make him whisper, get away from the door; Jehovah Witness
He like, ""Damn, where you get that from?"" ""I know a nigga.""
.9 raised on Ave like he hung wit' older niggas
He could get the squeeze in the finger like I caught a splinter
Everyone stretch in the V like I bought a sprinter
I'm diggin' the grave, so hey, even the broad get injured
But she got a choice, Ave or tar (Avatar), but I ain't finna wait for the Water Bender
Let's be frank, you can get ya uncle pops like Dorian
Four to him, he plugged in the head like Morpheus
Legs on it, clappin' from the stands like an audience
Or squeeze wit' the strap over the shoulder like Steve with the accordion
I brought a pump, just to start the water front
Nova Scotia, ya own funeral, but they don't even know if you come
This a coffin closer, this nigga greedy
I was cool with you and wigs, then we talked it over
I said, ""Fuck it. I'll have a tool to ya (two liter) back."" Kel with the orange soda
I'm slidin' over
Arm wit' the nose, I'm tryin' to find an odor
Know this (notice) hit ya crew but it was meant for you; non disclosure
Weave, weave, jab, I knock him over
One hit and it be days (daze) like this, mama told us
Get everything sent in store, I'm not a doja
Sig' (cig') and a .40 on Ave, it's not a Cobra
Buck 50, get a pun and a smile, I'm not a joker
I turn a Shark into a Swordfish; John Travolta
It's a prize under the seat, I'm watchin' Oprah
A couple mops, waitin' for the stain, I got ammonia ('em on ya)
BAOW! I ain't have to leave his face like that
Knifes, guns, bats, I play like that
Nigga hidin' in the Cave, think he safe like that

You know, it's all in your eyes, girl...

[Solomon Childs]
Now to the queens of the world, divine mothers of the world
Latina cover girls, the black pearls
Struggling for your kids, tryin' to be the best
Taking no shorts like Mae West, never would listen
What momma love would suggest, that you request
A partner in life, never putting you through so much stress
You holding down your foundation, all by yourself
Reminiscing from the pain that was once felt
From the fathers, who got they lives took
And the ones here, be everything in the book
From a bastard to a crook, reality be when he look
At the responsibility for the kids'll get him shook
See girl, cuz it was fifty-fifty when you layed down
That was '75, 25 when it came around
Yeah... you know, you know...
It's kinda real for them...

[Hook: Solomon Childs]
So many girls havin' babies on their own
To the kids, male figures is never known
Cuz it's rough in this world, taking care of your homes
So many girls havin' babies on their own

Stay strong, may your heart stay as hard as stone
Cuz it's rough in this world, taking care of your home
Nowadays, so many girls havin' babies on their own

Respect due from New York to L.A., sophisticated females
Floating with the grace of a nightingale
Shining, sexy with your hairdo's and painted nails
Exquisite, bringing magazines on the visit
Of The Source, the Black Tail, MB's
Champion sweatsuits at wholesale
Struggling, the 9-to-5 to get ya man's bail
At the crib with the kids waiting to exhale
Ladies on the real, you know the Killa Bamz kids
I'm tired of seeing young girls with tears
Struggling from the pain, thinking of the lies and the cheating
Going down, memory lane, never knowing what the man
Of your life, try'nna gain
Always in your face, yelling, predicate felon
Got the nerve to complain, to my queens, let me explain
Let me explain, let me explain, yeah... you know, come on

[Hook]

[Solomon Childs]
Arguments and sticking, Bob Marley was doing his bids
Homeboy, I know you think they dealing and greave
But like you, son, women got needs
Car notes and housedeeds, kids to feed
Brothers making promises after promises on how days gon' get better
Whether poor or rich, we gon' be together forever
But don't cry, from the lies after lies
By the dozens, talking forever, messing with your cousins
I'm not hating, strictly stating
Breaking down the jewels I've written, Cover Girl you secondary
Remotes necessary, to represent and hold down ya world, miss thing
Miss thing, miss thing...

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

When you lived inside of me
There was nothing I could conceive
That you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away
You changed that right away, baby

You abandoned me

Love don't live here anymore
Just emptiness and memories
Of what we had before
You went away
Found another place to stay, another home

You abandoned me
Love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy
Love don't live here anymore

[Verse 3]
Through the windows of my eyes
Everyone can see the loneliness inside me
Why'd you have to go away?
Don't you know I miss you so and need your love?

Yo, we make parties
Escalate into giant brawls.  The bouncers
Didn’t check me correctly.  Ergo, your Timberlands
Turned into running shoes.  Of course
That’s if your knees don’t turn noodle.  Come on
You know me.  Niggas warn their chicks, “Stand up”
When they due on the M.O.P
“Ante Up” when there’s many rough.  Shorty
All moist—I think her panties stuck
Peel ‘em off, wring ‘em out, make her fish fry
Let’s dance.  Nope?  Then you’re wearing this drink tonight
It’s just one of them nights.  Come on, son
One too many fights.  Come on, son

We slide in real early.  Punk, don’t act wild on records

Metal out.  Guess who sound ghetto now?

When you know that it exists

Will comfort you when there's no hope in sight

I've waited for you all those years
Then just when it began he took your love away

When you know that it exists

Yo, I'm a dark Abyss
Apocalypse in my esophagus breathing phosphorous while kamikazes spit on top of it
Stomp the continents in consequence of your incompetence
My consciousness, emits the kind of cognac that you vomit with
I'm kind of sick
Comets hit with less of confidence
So common is devoured galaxies in lines of optimus
Galactus of the brain waves
Captain of the mayday
If God required 7, than I conquered on the 8th day
My Dragons reign is red pain
Blood Pumping through dead veins
Entire mind's my left brain
Creation caused my membranes
I post apocalyptic vision of warlocks and witches
With wisdom placed from incisions of surgically gifted children
My intensities strike heaven's peace down to the guts of centipedes
And dead MC's who stepped to the  Rivers who scorched the seven seas

57th passenger, fouler than your pastor is
My mind's arachnid, masterful, weave a web of massacres
Ambassador of cracking wigs, casket full of captured pigs
I rap to the percussion of crushed skulls and snapped ribs
The fact is I'm brutal, my backyard's like Lebanon
A lexicon drinking cherub's blood from a devil's horn
Peddle porn, dope, soap & hope like it's a telethon
The metal drawn precise like a draftsman-accurate-shred velours
And level all in radius, my razor rips with gracefulness
I'll split your face, the stage & pavement, lift the blade then shred the skies
Everything alive is jeopardized when I've been weaponized
I specialize in genocide, seven lives beyond death
My conquest stretches from Asgard to the Throggs Neck
Mosh pit symphonies, center of the chaos, a marksman
Shoot you out of the circle of your seance, fuck fortune
You play the odds or lay your cards and forfeit, ahh

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You think that sleeps an option?
But sleep to me is like a lethal toxin
I walk the street looking for meat so I can feed the goblin
It takes a god's philosophy to conquer these concoctions
Telekinesis between dolphins in the deepest cauldron
Failure is never in my mind it couldn't be an option
I went to Kashmir to see inside the Jesus coffin
It's either heat or boxin, because the beast is watching
Nobody ever wanted you, you had to seek adoption
I have a lust for blood and that isn't a recent problem
I have a lust for drugs, and not to mention drinking problems
I put em in the motherfuckin' trash cause he a opossum
I pull the stainless, make them shameless like if he was Rossum
It's time to bring the fucking pain this is a demons doctrine
I take the ox and slice you up like it was Dietz & Watzon
Every rhyme I write is heroin, you need Suboxone
Rest in peace, BLOCKA BLOCKA now you meeting Cochran

278,Soul Food,"[Verse 1]
Goddamn, goddamn—conversations with legends
Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus
Money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us, the baby cryin'
Crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him
I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it?
I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin’, sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin’, skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the store
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
Can’t take no more, mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I’m from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin’ with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I’m De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like ""Thriller""
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don’t do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)
Yeah

[Break: Thalia]
Hip-hop

[Chorus]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Bitch, I said, ""I bet I be.""
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans they say they love you
But they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want
How they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry
'Bout bitches and getting blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference is I'm stronger
And better from when I've begun
So when people that never knew me
They tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged?
I just stop, and do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give?
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions
That shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh

[Chorus]
I swear this music in my genes like Denim
Lyricism seep in 'em like venom
Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer
Even though heaven sent him

Seen the watch, now she wanna give crotch
Boy got Ps, now she hopping in the pod
Man in real life, sugar gyaldem haffi get wopped (Yeah)
Know she want dark, told her ""Meet me at the top""
Switching lanes the other day, I seen her waiting for a bus
Baby this a Moncler sweater, Diesel denim
Buy another when my pockets fat like Heather
Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind
She make it clap like I'm Busta Rhymes
I got the juice, the sauce and all them things
I blammed her twice and neither wore my bling
Big Benz, I drive, I brought that ting
Any girl you want, they want my ting

Flood my ice, make a hoe blush
Back at the tour bus, gettin' caught up
DSquared got 'em distressed, got a hand wash
New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my straps, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's a head loss
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mom while you twiddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get on, where I'm from, it's on
Yes, man don't take no dumb, threats

Wrist froze, don't touch
French Ciri, I'm so drunk (Turnt)
If I can't drink and drive, where's my chauffeur?
Bando upsuh, whip that coca
I really hope this time my worker don't floss
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up
It's ironic, I just sold out my show in Scotland
Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map
But one day I'ma change the map in Tottenham

281,Fu-Gee-La,"[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
We used to be number 10, now we're permanent at one
In the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn!...another dead pigeon;
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror;
Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an Acura
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies
Becomin' enemies of their own families!
Armageddon come, you know-a we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

Yeah, in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons 'til high noon
Bust rap tunes on flat spoons, take no shorts like poom poom's
See hoochies pop coochies for Gucci's and loochies
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey, Hey, Hey - try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say, Say, Say - like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Odd-ly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust!
'Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen ""Cooley High"", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, black-listed by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode

Ha Ha Ha Ha, you whole sound set booty, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, you have to respect Jersey

How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath
With you, ooh ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

[Chorus]
So take a look at me now
Oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face

[Verse 2]
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me

Pry it out of my cold dead hands if you want it
I'm a entity, never represent an enemy
Death is my only legacy
Yea my rhythm is within 100 and I get a ghost
Feeling like i'm Patrick Swayze
I'm roundhousing, I'm kicking craniums acting crazy
I been acting lately, reacting, can't masquerade it
The masses hate it, and they seeking damage,and can't escape it
(Uhhhh) You crying?
Too bad, don't mind me I'm just hanging two bags
Remnants of your body, I'm leaving no evidence
I'ma drag you to the bridge, and lift you up to the ledge and it's (water sound)
Walk away like I know nothing
No emotions, I'm cold, I don't show nothing
You're desperate, How you good?
You don't know nothing
But the bulge in my drawers lets you know I hold something
It's a penis, open it up and just eat this
I'm a genius, only way to concede this
Mental defect, that was reject
You ain't seen the heat yet, till the homies bring the heaters
Then you done!
But I came for respect
I detect bullshit, get your feet wet
I bring death, and you seem tense
No keep when I set you on the seat sweat
Pass the forceps, I'll perform an abortion on you so you're born as a corpse, yes
Swinging on the mic, don't stop till I tear pecs
Saran wrap his ass up like a corsette
Been dead, done that
It's not my first time
I been ill, done sick since my first rhyme
If you don't know my ass, I'm a sociopath
And I won't stop till the earth is mine

I'ma kill it, show all of you sons of bitches who the realest. Grilling you like at Nick's when I'm cooking up in the kitchen. Dishing up washed up rappers like who the fuck is you kidding? I'm winning, you losing, see you at the finish
When I'm finished, what is Statz a chemist?
Shoot these people when life don't hand you lemons
Blow up the radio stations to the point they forced to hear us because they have no choice but to listen
You Goddamn right you tripping, you slipping, giving me lip and.. I'm tired of hearing about your situation cause those ain't the shoes that you fit in
Wasting my time all cause you think you need to get rich and fuck some dumb ass bitches?
Mother fucker Statz is god sent, you nonsense, with a pussy voice and a stupid ass conscious
My cousin Hyde gave em the bomb threat, there's an atomic bomb strapped to your chest
You will not rap again, shit is not happening, we was there and we came back, and we got come back again
Fampires my friends, these haters gon do just whatever the fuck Yung Statz says
Better play dead, lay low and just make bread. All you hating ass rappers take dick
Take ya pick bitch, Imma prick and I know it but everything I spit makes sense
And you mad at me? But don't be mad at me
You should be glad actually I'm tryna figure out where the fuck these racks be
That you be rapping bout, your raps are shit its time to drag you out
Oh you cashing out? I'ma rob your ass so you ain't flashing now

Youth I was doomed like It's marked by the beast
Got used to to my room cause my moms liked to drink
Now this world mine while i puke in this sink
Cause i'm drunk and i'm high with some coke in my stream
Somebody get to fighting and the whole team blackout
Jumping up out my writing get your whole team dragged out
They don't know what they reciting while they wifi with a hyphen till we outside smoking and lighting turning yo body into a trap house
You wanna keep your face safe?
Then homie have a great day
You hit me with a play fake i'll break your leg in 8 ways
Cut you with your mixtape, sounding like you 8'th grade
Hopping up on the internet quotation marks ""they hate""
Sitting back on grape ape, watching over 90% of you Motherfuckers acting ignorant for paid fame
Oh ya'll just wanna play games?
I'm trying to take over this world fuck it and make change
Started making music for the art that shit ain't change
Planned on taking over from the start now that shit brain
Couple situations where i thought the world was hating,now it's fire when i demonstrate the spark for the propane
Listen to my motherfucking heart going cocaine
Care about you motherfuckers dark to the glow state
Dragged through the gutter with some bad motherfuckers with a bag of this stutter with a chrome thang

Earth for myself niggers, sticking it with the rhythm
Digging it with precision
But really I’m a menace
Fucking around with that beast mode division
We about to hit em, and split em, and inject the with some of that venom
Better believe I spend it, i'ma make that profit
Stop watching my pockets, all you fucking pocket watchers
Talking about that rocket launcher
Give two minutes and i'ma heat up like a hot pocket
Give her the benji, Watch her bounce it like a hydraulic
Sick of motherfuckers always talking about “I got it”
Smoking the weed like I’m skydiving
High flying, “Bye, Pilot!”
Little different I be watching Sci-Fi
Isn’t it ironic how I rock it
And you watch it, and you probably hate it
Cause you see a nigga steady dropping
Always plugged in, to the music
Ain't no room on my socket, NIGGA
Earth for myself so that means fuck you
Do I got friends? Yeah a couple
Why should I trust you through the struggle?
You wasn't with me when a nigga had to hustle
You wouldn’t come and get me when a nigga got in trouble
Almost lit a nickel, 'cause I had the pistol
But I had to call my lawyer, let him know that I……
Got locked up.....
And he told me to be humble, never mumble in front of the judge
If want him to budge, and do just what you want to I…
I was feeling puzzled, smoke the blunt and shave my stubble
Got ready for my court date
Gotta watch who you hang with, who you bang with
Not everyone on the same shit
Earth for myself, gotta stay up in your lane
In the game, never worry about nobody else

Bawk bawk shit these boys be chicken they don't want beef
Blood all over my hands cause I hit em with a chrome peice
There ain't no peace stepped up on him leave him deceased pants creased unleash the beast Ina bloody sheet
I ain't seen no defeat boy these bitches weak weak
Tryna act hard like now and laters they sweet sweet
Motherfucka's banging on the net I call em tweet tweet
Pokin' their nose where it don't belong I'm bout to play for keeps Suicide prevention they can have it fuck the police
I'm all about my business if u missed it then u can't speak
Dark halls creepin through yo house so you can't sleep Motherfucka's don't wanna admit it when they get beat
They call me Fluenci boy I never retreat
Propaganda on a mission caring man they so bleak
Havin motherfucka's so scared that they can't eat
Doin what I have to do to make it in this swap meet

[Verse 6: Twistid Rob]
You internet bangers about to take a fold
When I throw my knuckles up got militants to roll
If you want to play with ammunition boy I’m at your throat
Don’t be walking on my planet, understand the code
I’m monstrous, motherfucka I’m odd as shit
With two balls on top of a obelisk
My shit got me withered by the elementals burn 'em like an arsonist
Target this, step into my world of darkness leave you heartless kid
You don’t want no part of it
When I carve em with the chete hex 'em,with the voodoo
Alotta of people in this underground are full of fabrication
Talking out your colon, I know you dude!
You ain’t nobody, makin' no money
Think you so funny, no dummy
You a bold buddy, I’m about to go nutty
With the flow cutty, on the globe bloody
Like a demon coming out the living room the shotty go boom boom

[Verse 7: Crucified]
Crucified coming to kill again, take all their blood again, break in so fucking lit, as for the terror I bring in the building, can't nobody fuck with it, or imma split again
Taking the gun and make it a witness, I'm making it crack I'm bumping the heat again, making the shot and I'm packing it finna [?], taking the pump and I'm making it wickeder
Really you gotta be feeling me dropping then taking then bucking the shots, feeling the body I'm bringing a fully I wouldn't be giving a fuck cause I got the buzz
The way I'm bringing the syllables cooking I be doing it quicker than fast so I be in the back of the party putting an end so fuck it I'm bringing the bust
Syllables coming up right to ball get up on duty I'm busting them right again, said I'm beheading em so fuck at em, gonna get in the middle of map give it to em bringing the semi
Then gon really go to be giving predicaments, never they go to then put up with shit with us, said I'm identical, chopping the body I'm gonna be bringing em nothing
Make up a pack of the wickeder, picking the gat up and take on the rhythm, giving a fuck and I'm coming to double up all of my lyrics, I get em with venom I kill em with ease when they possibly coming to bullshit I dump with the rhythm my flow is a vision don't fuck with the wisdom if I catch you fishing or breaking the ritual come with the VENGEANCE

[Verse 8: K-fix]
With the pen and the pad i'ma get to scribbling and dibbling, dab
When i'm on the rhythm, i'ma riddle it fast
With a little bit of adrenaline, then i'ma spaz
I'ma disaster, when i hop in the window get on the gas
Get 'em a blast, killing 'em sending 'em a casket
Hopping the trigger and i show 'em then i'm fillin 'em up with the pill of madness
Spitting the flash, with a pen a venomous assassin
Fill 'em with venom, then I'ma be choppin 'em up in a villainous fashion
When i'm gettin the blast, i hit em up then it collapse, thinkin the game full of bastards, then it's somethin to me
When they choke on the slab, dumpin' the gun in the trash, hit em shit they can't understand, chokin the ho so she can't breathe
When I'm poppin my meds, the finger is still trashin
When it sound like a dab, I'm comin out of my bed, I'ma slam a nigga like wrath, when I shoot from the hip I'm sickest with a revolver, they thought it was Billy the Kid shit

Four o'clock, I still can't find you
Scared of what our love has come to
I wait by the phone and I feel so alone
I cared for you
I think about the way you treat me
You care about your friends before me
Taken for granted and left empty handed
I needed you

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish you could see
How much I did for you than me
And if I could
I would turn all the bad to good

If you love me, then show me you care
Then I'll be there
Give me, just give me a reason
(Give me a reason)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there
(Boy, why should I come back to you?)

[Verse 2]
Can't you see how much you hurt me
To give away your love so easily?
I opened my eyes and I saw your lies
Now you're on your knees
I think about the way that you treat me
To take you back you've got to show me
Say that you love me
So show me you care, then I'll be there

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish you could see
How much I did for you than me
And if I could
I would turn all the bad to good

You know that I loved you
But you treated me so bad
(You've got to change if you want me back)
And maybe it won't hit you
Until you lose the one you had

Give me, just give me a reason
(Why should I come back to you?)
If you love me, then show me you care
(Show me you care)
Then I'll be there

289,Time,"[Time]

[Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Richard Wright]
And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say

[Breathe Reprise]

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can

290,"Gangsta's Paradise (From ""Dangerous Minds"")","Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Coolio. Now, I don't think pop music history as a whole has been very kind to Coolio, since as far as I can remember, everyone's kind of taken him to be a bit of a joke, a rapper to not be taken seriously. When you talk about the biggest names in hiphop in the 90's, the names that are often tossed around are cats like Biggie Smalls, Wu-Tang, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, LL Cool J, and Nas, but I almost never hear any praise for Coolio, which is interesting, because, I mean, he wasn't a bad rapper or anything, he was decent enough, and the man had multiple hits back in the day, and in fact, the song I'm reviewing today, became the first rap song to be number 1 on the billboards year-end charts, so people knew who he was, and, I think people still know who he is, he's not some obscure reference that time forgot, I just think that, well, people don't really respect Coolio as far as Hiphop is concerned, and, hey, I get it, the guy's name is a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""yo"", his name couldn't sound like a more cheesy ""urban"" buzzword if he called himself ""nahmean-nahmsayin"", and yeah, at the height of his fame, he did rap the theme song for a kids' t.v. show, definitely not the most gangsta thing to do in hindsight, but I'll defend that move, because, hey, Kenan and Kel was a good show, and he never struck me as someone who was trying to be a super thug or anything, But hey, honestly: it was the hair, wasn't it? Yeah, it was probably the hair. I mean, few things are gonna make you look like a comical portrayal of hip hop's aggressiveness than gravity defying braids. *I refuse to bow down to any law written by a white man, and neither will my hair!* But yeah, while I think the zero G braids were cool, it's not exactly the most toned down look you could have. I mean, if the only other rapper rocking' a similar hairstyle to you is this guy:

*show ODB with hair*

You might wanna go for something different if you want to be taken seriously. It's also not helping that, despite the fact that he's currently balding, he's decided to keep his braids up, on the two little islands of hair left on his head. Dude, cut that off, man! Go out with some dignity! *looks over* Oh, what's that? He's doing soundtracks for porn websites now? …alright… And I will say that, in addition, it's not like ""Gangsta's Paradise was the only type of music he was making. His first hit was actually this:

""Fantastic Voyage""

Yeah, a lot of his stuff was actually a lot more party oriented, but with a hardcore rap slant to it. And actually, if you think about it, his first smash hit was a song that actually serves as a transitional point for what was happening in hiphop at the time. ""Fantastic Voyage"" was released in 1994, the time period in Hiphop where rap in the mainstream charts was losing it's grip on happy dance music like C+C Music factory and Kid n Play in favor of hardcore rap like 2Pac and Bone Thugz N Harmony dominating the charts. And ""Fantastic Voyage"" represented the harder edge of that party music, but a lighter side of gangsta funk, with the bouncing bass and synth sounds commonly associated with Dr. Dre's style of harsher, thugged out rap personas, while the song, indeed incorporating themes of ghetto culture, had a main message about Coolio wishing he could close his eyes and escape the dangers of his neighborhood

Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside

Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it

A Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by

And ya know, where this song encapsulated the transition of trends in mainstream rap, this happier joint wasn't the one people remembered the most. The one that topped the charts and solidified Coolio into the minds of millions was the song, ""Gangsta's Paradise"". This, in my eyes, is the quintessential song that represented Hiphop's identity as a genre and at the same time, echoed the mind set of Black culture in American Society in the 90's. In fact, I'd dare say that few songs that got this popular in the 90's really summed up the overall feel of the decade, at least as far as hiphop and it's young audience was concerned

*video starts*

You know, I actually think that, in addition to this song being good, this is quite an audacious music video here, A because it's one of the very few music videos for a song on a movie's soundtrack that actually tried to incorporate what was happening in the movie clips with what was happening in the actual video (seriously, how many music videos have you watched where they just randomly throw clips or t.v. screens in there showing parts of a movie that has absolutely nothing to do with the context of the video?), and B, because it ties so well into the movie that this is from, ""Dangerous Minds"", a movie about an upper class teacher coming into a poor neighborhood to get the hardest kids to teach interested in learning. Now, I can't tell you how good the movie is at portraying this, as I haven't seen it in a while, but I don't remember it being too terrible; however, the way they tie it into the music video itself, actually having Michelle Pfeiffer in the video for a cameo, was pretty cool. And then, she says the line:

""You wanna tell me what this is all about""

Which sets off the tone in a fitting way, as here is this person of upper class privilege coming into the darker world of poverty… *ahem* visually, but uh… I guess you could say ""ethnically"" as well, and she wants to know what this is all about, what is happening in the minds of the people of this environment. And this song and video served as a microcosmic interpretation of what was happening in the black community as gangsta rap got more popular in the homes of the people typically located outsides the confines of hip hop's culture at the time… ya know… upper class white folk

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone

Right of the bat, we start with Coolio interpolating a quote from Psalms, chapter 23, verse 4, and where, in the original context, the verse describes being comforted by a loving God through hardships, inciting hope and faith, Coolio contrasts that with being unassured of his life's path, saying that, now that he's gone down this road, there's no way out for him, nothing left for him to do but ride out this path of destruction until his demise, and that, in addition, no one believes in his ability to be anything more than a lowlife thug

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You betta watch how ya talkin' and where ya walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk

*eyes get low* I'm gonna assume that this rhyme scheme is actually a clever way to indicate that Coolio's character had a neglectful elementary school teacher, and instead focus on the content, where he defends his motives, citing that, despite everyone on the outside wanting to portray his actions as thoughtless and unjustified, that they arise from an instinct that comes from living in an environment where survival means killing any man who poses a threat

As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke

Now this is interesting imagery. He might be saying that he actually sees himself in the smoke, which… probably isn't likely, since smoke isn't very reflective, OR, he could be saying that he sees the smoke, the result of the fired pistol, as a part of him, he sees himself IN it, and what pistol smoke is, is an aftereffect of a violent action, which is what he embodies as what he is: an aftereffect of a violent society

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Going back to my point that this song encapsulates the 90's, we have a heavily sampled beat and chorus, which flips a Stevie Wonder song, but gives it a darker, more sinister tint

*play original*
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise

You know, I really like it when a song not only uses a sample, but changes the feel of it, as Stevie Wonder's original version sounds more cerebral and contemplative, as from what I can tell from it's cryptic writing, is about people who are obsessed with the past and waste their lives reminiscing on a time that might not actually be as great as they thought it might have been, not focusing on the problems that are present in front of them, people who may be lost or insecure, and are seeking something to comfort them, similar to the psalm quoted at the beginning of Coolio's verse. Now, what do they do to flip it?

Keep spending most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

So here, L.V., the singer, is saying that they've been surrounded by the exact type of environment that criminals thrive off of, just as dead animals attract buzzards, the environment that they have been born into, the hood, attracts criminal activity. So, when you're born into it, why WOULDN'T you get caught up in it? It doesn't matter what type of person you throw into it, either: this environment we live in invites criminals based on the way it functions. So, as you may have guessed, the word ""paradise"" is a subversion of what the word typically represents. And whereas a lesser emcee would have used the ""paradise"" angle to blast on the fleeting perks that come with that life, like maybe the rush of drugs, easy women and power, this song focuses mainly on how this paradise is in reality festering pool of negative energy that inherently drags you down

Look at the situation, they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street

And I pretty much… just explained that line before it happened…

So I gotta be down with the 'hood team
Too much television watching, got me chasing dreams

And in this lyric, he throws a quick jab at television's typical portrayal of life, as frequently on t.v., we see the lives of those who live 10 times better than we may ever live, and it causes us to not be content with reality, to chase after a shallow, predetermined expectation of success

Power in the money, money in the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'

A lot can be said about this guy's cadence, which has gruff but ear-catching vocal inflection, so that each line rises in it's energy and pitch, that when it gets to the end of the 4th line in the couplet, you've heard this build up of tension, leading to him saying that everyone's afraid of him, scared of who he is and what he represents, and when he says that last line, it honestly comes across as a man who doesn't know what's wrong with himself, why he is the way he is, what even motivates his actions anymore. And what really cranks this song up to what it represents is broken down in the last few lines:

They say I gotta learn
But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, foo!

This is honestly to me, one of the most important lyrics in Hiphop here. In lower class communities, our school systems keep getting their budgets gutted every year, and we have to deal with bad teachers, outdated books, and a biased educational system that doesn't care if students actually learned anything as long as they mindlessly memorize facts for tests that will never apply to their every day lives. Here, he makes it plain, in a general sense: if our own government doesn't see the value in our intelligence, and actively doesn't care about our well-being, if the ones in charge don't want to help us, and actively cut the funding for education, and has authority figures that abuse their power for their own gain at my expense, why do I need to care about what their institution wants to tell me? THAT, my friends, is what the youth of the 90's were going through in poor neighborhoods, and for the first real time in music history, you had to pay attention to the unedited words of a disenfranchised chunk of America, the people that were once glossed over are now in your face, and you had to be uncomfortable, you had to see what America's racist, classist system had done to those not lucky enough to be born in a suburban neighborhood, and FINALLY, AMERICA, YOU HAD TO LOOK YOUR PROBLEMS IN THE EYE, AND ONCE YOU DID THAT, YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO… *sigh* assimilate the culture into a watered down caricature of it's former self, without really understanding it's problems, draining it of any impact, and grossly rewarded those who exploited and exaggerated the ills of it's lifestyle. Life is stupid like that…

Anyways, I give this song a 5 out of 5 stars. You know, a lot of mainstream rap songs talked about being gangsta and hardcore, but very few gave you a look into the paranoid persona, the pessimistic, self-destructive thought processes that come with it, at least very few have done it in ways that didn't come off as just trying to sound cool. I didn't feel like he enjoyed any of this. I felt like he hated this lifestyle, he hated himself, and he hated the world that put him here. This song is a lament, it is a dark evaluation of what was going on in the heart of Hiphop, and it was needed in pop culture, and… hey, this song was also parodied by Weird Al… I swear, I'm not doing this on purpose...",Rap Critic,1996,"[50, 45, 38, 37, 34, 32, 24, 27, 27, 25, 31, 27, 26, 17, 15, 9, 4, 4]",18

It's true I said I love you but I didn't promise it
We came from grippin' AK's, our fingers got bunions
Keypad, no key to my door
And we made love

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another Xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the States from another planet
I'm fly as a bitch, when I make mistakes, another plannin', yeah

Yeah, I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me)
I bet she loves me (I bet she loves me, I bet she loves me)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Showed major love to my friends, bitch
I dropped the top off the Benz
Been rockin' since creme de la creme, yeah
I know we never go in
I tat the footprint of my kids, yeah, like forensics
Throw it to the ceiling, can't forget
My big brother coming home from a bid, yeah
Turbo 9-11 coupe for the rich
Turbo 9-11 coupe for the rich, yeah
I fucked her friend, I'd never tell her
I feed the swoop peanut butter and jelly
Up a hundred mil, let my nigga tell it
Up a hundred mil
I done cracked a seal, let these haters tell it
But I cracked a seal
I can get 'em killed, yeah Kill Bill
And I got diamonds from my toes up to my ears
Yeah I got an implant 'cause I took off the veneers
Yeah I got a red diamond on the eye ring, not tears
Got the shirt off in the Rolls Royce, yeah
Put a hole on the Kel-Tec, 'cause I ain't tryna get killed yet, hmm

[Verse 2: Future]
I don't give a fuck about big homie, I'm big homie 'round here
I'm rockin' blue diamonds, ain't nothin' to get you killed
You gonna get scarred, you don't get eternal life, nigga, yeah
Ballin' off of X before I rolled dice, nigga, yeah
The agent just called and said the Hawk was available, I'm ready
You all about the Hawk, nigga, that G5 is quality
It's pink, way more than I ever would've imagined
I didn't measure it so I'm higher than Aladdin
No swaps out, I'm undecided whenever I pop out
I had to swerve for four years, I'm still under forty thousand miles
Bought the Bentley coupe and a Bentley Spur on the same day
She drove the GT and fell in love with it the same day
She told me that was her favorite car, she dreamed about it
I couldn't walk away, my ego all in the way
I dropped cash on it, she told me she loved me even more (Freebandz)
These four doors and quaaludes, they got me dehydrated
Turn on me, sue me, no, nothing seems to amaze me
I left on a commercial flight and downgraded
If I could change anything, I wouldn't erase it (I wouldn't erase it)
Came back on a private plane and upgraded (I made it)
It had to be destiny, it had to be the recipe
Had to be the formula, I'm not normal, I told you (I told you)
If you would've took the flesh out me (Took the flesh out me)
You would've ran off with it and tried to convince me it was karma
(I bet she love me)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
All this fake love got me damaged
I can't take it, I just popped another Xanny
I'm fuckin' on your bitch when I land in the States from another planet

[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out

[Chorus]
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had

[Shael Riley]
So, this guy’s like, “I like the lyrics, but your delivery was a little… hoarse.”

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Uh huh…

[Shael Riley]
And no kidding, MC Horse full-on kicks this guy’s head through one of those stage amps

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Wow…

[Shael Riley]
Yeah, I’d never seen anything like-

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Wait, wait, wait. Hey. Hey! Kabuto!

[Kabuto the Python]
Oh, hey, Schaeffer, hey, what’s up you guys?

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Hey. Thanks for inviting us, Kabuto!

[Kabuto the Python]
Aw, absolutely

[Schäffer the Darklord]
This is an absolutely star-studded party!

[Shael Riley]
Yeah, there’s so many rappers in here…

[Schäffer the Darklord]
I can really feel the creative juices humidifying the air in here

[Shael Riley]
Did I ever tell you guys my secret fear?

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Yo, this music is getting me pumped!

[Kabuto the Python]
What’s your secret fear, Shael Riley?

[Shael Riley]
I have this dream that I’m in a huge room full of, like, twenty rappers...

[Kabuto the Python]
Uh huh…

[Shael Riley]
And... one of them just suddenly starts... rapping, and it sets off some kind of... chain reaction, and pretty soon they’re all just… rapping, at- at me-

[Kabuto the Python]
Well, then maybe you’d better get Schäffer-

[Schäffer the Darklord]
Yo…

[Kabuto the Python]
Hey, Schäffer!

[Rapping]
[Schäffer the Darklord]
Yo! Bust into the party with a totally colossal posse
Got a lot of awesome possums feeling awful naughty
Got a pocket-slash-headful of drugs, down and wicked
Call me Ad-Rock, son, cuz I’m about to (Kick it!)
Hop upon the countertops and talk a lot of rotten talk
Pop a lot of bottles copping pot and only rocking socks
A lady knows I’m Schäffer, maybe take her to the rooftop
First I gotta pass the mic before I crash or do shots

[Adam WarRock]
Bottle of Crooked Eye, looking fly, smoking lye
At least that's what they say in them rap songs, amidoinitrite?
I'm flipping a rhyme and killing the mic and keeping it tight, at least I'm
Trying my best to appear like I'm macking some felines
Beelines is made for that party dip, celery sticks
Probably seen me, I'm that kid who's always getting in shit
Down in the South, we'd slow roast some pulled pork
But on the internet, we pull corks with Dual Core

[Int80 (of Dual Core)]
Hey, I see a party (Dual Core!), no way to stop me
Kicking ill raps like my verse knows karate (yeaw!)
Honestly, I'd say there's no blocking me
We've got the best rappers: it's an oligopoly (woah!)
You'd prob'ly be better off with forfeits
See, we bring the sting like a corset of hornets (bzz! bzz!)
Similes are killing me, better rewind
Old school like a honeycomb full of beehives

[SayHi]
Yo. Top of the circle, and I’m prob’ly gon’ hurt you
The punchline has got me looking like I’m boxing with Urkel
I still admit it, though my rap’s insane
Like I’m walking up to crackheads and asking for change
I grab two shots, but they handing me more
Fast forward and I’m taking off her panties, of course
I’m bout to get the sloppy because I’m ramming a Horde
And bust a nut big enough to feed a family of four

[Da Silky Slimz]
[Big Wyrm]
The new improved party worm, Wyrm, you get me?

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
Teach ladies how to sin

[Big Wyrm]
Dudes are learning envy

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
Ain’t a person in the world that’s ready

[Big Wyrm]
So forget ‘em

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
We bringing down the house

[Big Wyrm]
Like Slurms McKenzie
Not having a meet greet

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
We spazzing like neat freaks

[Big Wyrm]
I’m snorting Dune spice off the back of a twi’lek

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
Dive into that blue

[Big Wyrm]
I’ll leave her ass in a deep sleep

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
When Slimz go out to party

[Big Wyrm]
We ain’t back for like three weeks

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
So at the crack of dawn, Masta Don still macking on
Platinum blondes with the matchin’ bras and panties off
We get our beer on

[Big Wyrm]
We hit the beer bong

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
We playin’ beer pong

[Big Wyrm]
Until all the beer’s gone

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
We’re more Irish than Sinead O’Connor’s potato farmer

[Big Wyrm]
Chugging whole kegs

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
Like it ain’t no problem

[Big Wyrm]
Y’all got on ya beer goggles on

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
Lordy lordy

[Big Wyrm]
Slimz got 20/20

[Masta Don da Mastodon]
After forty 40s

[Old Snake Da CQC MC]
DAMN, I didn’t get no Evite
Sneak by security and now they sleep tight
I step up in the party, Lodi Dodi
And probably do shots off of hotties’ bodies
And if, you wanna cock block and stop me
Headshots instead, red dots, you’re dead
La La La La Li Lu Le Lo
No respawns, lay low, this ain’t a game bro

[Beefy]
Oldschool!
Ring the bell and I’ll jump into it quick
I’m barely in your debt because I keep it Lannister rich
I’m the incident that gets ya fired, kicked out of school
So when your girl gets mad I stroll up asking, “How do you do?” (What’s up, boo?)
Beefy T kinda cool, but he ain’t legendary
Leave ya in a cemetery, only tell your secretary
Drop the mic and break it so nobody else can go, yo
It’s out of my control, but that’s the only way I close

[Whoremoans]
Someone tell these dudes they need to quit playing
There’s a full moon out and my spirit animal is Saiyan
Y’all don’t want to see me like a movie starring a Wayans
That isn’t Keenan Ivory or Damon
You told me to drop eight bars
Motherfucker, I don’t count, I just rhyme hard
And when I go soft, I fluff myself
I should have more confidence, as much as I love myself

[The Scrub Club All​-​Stars]
[MadHatter]
Scrub Club in the house, raise up your hands
Grab an energy drink, drop your pants and dance

[Klopfenpop]
Because the sans-pants dance is the stance of the club
And we enhance tracks aptly while advancin’ the love

[Remi-son]
Yo! Taking no pity on people who never show no love
So I raise the stakes high if you want something from us. Yeah!

[King Pheenix]
Da Ro Fus, hold up your cups, watch the bird fly
Inverted perversion of the words turns your third eye

[Viet Vu]
So high, like a bird’s eye, in the midst of flight
Drop bomb rhymes so fly, that’s a skyline

[Maros]
Remind minds, we heavy, our rhymes remain steady ill
Hope your body is ready, we murder beats... lyrikill

[Buc Preston (of Southside)]
My nut sack’s spherical, yeah, I keep it snug
Fuck your ironic roomba, yeah, I keep it smug

[Thunderball (of Southside)]
Dookie taker. Wake and baker
Crack the wax, tall glass, come on out, my Maker’s

[Navi]
They got me sipping that overclocked firewater, gimmie any subject
And I’ll weigh in on a fat mic punkin drublic
By comparison the half wit tip’s so subtle
On some Japanese drill bit gravel pit kerfuffle
‘Cept to cuddle won’t let the flow hover round smooth
In advance, bring days to rue
And I’m sued by Darude for the Sandstorm madlib
But still burning active, no Anatoly Dyatlov
Billy goats paint gruff up in fifty coats
And plagiarize 50 Cent Wikiquotes on sticky notes
Navi knows second nature to the forte -
But y’all cool, me I’m sorbet trays in Norway
Hah!
Yeah we can do this all day
Yeah we can do this all day
We can do this our way
What’s that weed smoke drifting down the hallway?

[Mikal kHill]
Antisocial, cold rock the party?
Nah, rather chill solo
Alright though, you got me here, fuck beer
Where’s the Jack Daniels?
I drink until I’m ‘bout to fucking fly up off the handle
I know you’re gonna dig this
I get ruthless
Kick out the rhythms and I slap your mans toothless
They like, “Who’s this?”
Shit, you show respect
You ain’t seen my name in motherfucking Readers Digest?
I’m the best, goddammit, I’m awesome
Crooked teeth, broke glasses - fuck flossing
It's Mikal kHill, mean mugging like you took my turn
Rapping since I was five but now I’m back to burn

[Sulfur]
I strolled up to the door with a bottle in hand
Half full, cause pregaming was the plan
I could hardly stand, been drinking hard
Made it to the door, already threw up in the yard
Don’t stare, it’s a party right?
I’m trying to throw up hands and get down tonight
To the fright of whoever it was that answered my knock
I walked right in and put my hands on my-- schmock
Not a perv, just don’t know how to dress
Drunk as all high fuck, not trying to impress
Don’t stress--I know you shouldn’t party round kids
Don’t know who let ‘em in, but I kicked ‘em out, you dig?
Feeling big, hit the kitchen for snacks
When the boys in blue stopped me in my tracks
As they cuffed and put me in they car
Saw all my friends chilling in the neighbor's yard
Fuck!

[The Ranger]
Now just lay back and let The Ranger serenade ya
Major player in Australia with some bases in Asia
Rival rappers, meet your maker like you are on Arya Stark’s list
A man’s ready to rock a rhyme, so let me spark this
A guest from NRS to bless the track and if you have to ask
I’ll attack you like I’m Stannis and I’ll stab you with some dragon glass
Stick ‘em with the pointy end, you don’t know, leave the mic alone
Shit, you ain’t fit to sit the Iron Throne, so go on home, nerd!

[Billy the Fridge]
(coughing)
Man, I think I burned the edibles
Can’t eat the medical, eat the high chick’s genitals
Call me the General, the clit Commander
Tongue lashing so fierce I hit innocent bystanders
And my standards don’t really exist
So dirty nerdy girlies come give Billy a kiss
And I really insist that she got awesome breasts
A sight for sore eyes in this sausage fest

[Random]
It’s a party going on and all my buddies are here
I walk in high-stepping over puddles of beer
Now let me cop a squat before I pop a shot
Cuz I like to stay well-rounded, like Oswald Cobblepot
Turn the music up and grab the cutie next to you
Dance ‘til it looks like you’re doing something sexual
Crash to the sectional and pick up the mic
Kick rhymes all night to the party’s delight, well, alright

[Jesse Dangerously]
At the rap party again, I'm Mad Martigan
Cage dancing caveman jester, swag's ancestor
Canada's Sage Francis? Honey, you flatter me
Take chances - save the money for batteries
That's French for drums - you think it's fresh, then come
Get you some... and experience peer pressure from
The best in the room. Enter unassuming? Ha! You been
Sent to your doom, I guess the guests are not human!

[Wordburglar]
Somebody order a burg? Hold the mayo
Kabuto called me up and said, “Come over right away,” so
I grabbed a veggie tray and pop and chips
Never show up empty handed, even brought some dips
Got a new haircut and I ironed my pants
And now the party’s popping like you filled the dryer with cans
Of spraypaint, make way and wake the neighbors
Stay smooth all night like you shaved some ravers

[MC Frontalot]
I'm at Kabuto's! There seems to be a soiree, but I don't do those
How'd this happen to me? Who knows
Front'll hug on the wall, and watch all of you all
‘til the governor calls in the National
Garden Association
To report on what rappers are doing to Kabuto's mom's landscaping
I'm saying that it's out of control
But the whole joint's jumping up and that was your goal

[Kabuto the Python]
Dear everybody--guests that I wrote on the list
Thanks for being on my song, y'all are doper than shit
And whether you be sipping cola or be smoking the piff
You ought to know that this collabo was my Kokoro Wish
Biggest posse track, thought it would be tough to sell
But you all showed up and now I'm chuffed as hell
The guest list definitely stuffed the bill (ho ho ho)
And now we finna party like a Hutt cartel

Time to get off
Let's get it on
Anytime you're in the mood to groove
Give me a call
Just say the word, I'll be right there
Baby, I'm gonna fill you up with tender love and care
It's all to make you feel good
To carry you to ecstasy
If you give me directions, communicate to me, baby

Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

[Verse 2]
It's time to come closer
‘Cause we got the urge
So baby, can we do it once or twice just to rehearse
When can we work it out?
When can we work it out?
Or do you like it when I get my groove on
Round and around and around and around

It's all to make you feel good

Ah yeah, it feels good

We're getting down
All the way down
We're going down
Where did you want me to put it? (Down)

Is it right here? (Is it over there?)
Is it where you want it? (Baby, I don’t care)
When we're making love, I love to get you warm

[Chorus]
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it
If you want me to get it right
Tell me what should I do with it
‘Cause you’re starting to work it down
And I don't want to lose it
Baby, tell me where do you want me to put it

Tell me where do you want me to put it

Tell me what should I do with it

Should have looked both ways before I let you cross my mind

But you at a thousand just like that
So run that back 'cause you so bad let’s do this one more time

Ooo
Please don’t go
Ooo
Please don’t go

[Verse 2]
Thought I made the rules until you redefined the game
Trying to keep it cool but damn you’re fire like a flame
Every move I make you match
You know how to light me up like that
Wish I didn't want it but I do so won’t you stay

[Chorus]
Please don't go
Please don't go, don’t go
Please don't go
Please don't go, don’t go

[Bridge]
You could be the end of me
But if it kills me I still want you as a ghost
Yeah I would give you anything
Just please don't go

[Verse 3]
Oh I hope you're happy that you ruined me for good
Set the bar too high I swear you always knew you would
I don't know how I will survive
If I let you walk out of my life
So come on back to bed and let’s wake up the neighbourhood

The moon—

First time I heard your voice
Moonlight burst into the room
And I saw your eyes
And I saw your smile
And the world opened wide
And the world was inside of me

And I catch my breath
And I laugh and blush
And I hear guitars
You are so good for me

I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I’ll never be this happy again
You and I
And no one else

We’ve done this all before
We were angels once
Don’t you remember?
Joy and life
Inside our souls
And nobody knows
Just you and me
It’s our secret

This winter sky
How can anyone sleep?
There was never such a night before!
I feel like putting my arms round my knees
And squeezing tight as possible
And flying away
Like this...

Oh the moon
Oh the snow in the moonlight
And your childlike eyes
And your distant smile
I’ll never be this happy again

You and I

299,Keep Tryin',"[Verse: Tom Pepe]
Look, to tell the truth y'all - I'm feeling pretty lost
I was trying to be a boss but they nailed me to a cross
Cut open my head so that they can read my thoughts
Blessed with this gift but it came at a cost
I be cursed in my own mind, hurts when I don't rhyme
Workin' on my verses like I'm searching through a gold mine
Lately I've been faced with reality, even college graduates barely got a salary
Rappers think they fat but they barely got a calorie
Grew up in Seattle, where they used to call me Casualty
Because I never backed down from a battle scene
Life is good but it damn sure ain't hassle free
An MC, well it's sort of what I had to be
My life is one big beautiful catastrophe
I take a rap beat, turn it into a masterpiece
A starving artist, I ain't leaving 'til I had a feast
There's some things that I had to experience to stop being oblivious
And take life serious, I'm so tired everyday I feel delirious
Only livin' for the people who be hearing this
I make music cause see that's where all my spirit is
The definition of a heart felt lyricist
Hard to find, it don't matter what year this is
Nearly died now I'm livin' with this fearlessness
Like whatever gonna happen, hope it happens for a reason
If it don't well then I'm coast, still be happy that I'm eating
Life ain't fair, that's why I'm rappin' instead of preachin'
So I'm absolutely passionate with every word I'm speakin'
If you feel it then just pass it on, it's more people I'm reachin
A student of the truth but it's the youth that I be teachin'
If you breathing in the air seeing things ain't really fair
Make a difference because you can instead of livin' like you isn't there
Most nights well I feel like I have to write, my life's a chess game -
Seeing things black and white. We live like animals, thinkin' of the afterlife
It's overwhelming so we drinkin' or we pass the pipe
I go to rap shows, wishin' they would pass the mic -
'Cause they repeatin' what you heard like a class you don't like
I'm back in the fight, ain't asking you twice It's only ignorance left so I pass on the right
And...

[Hook: Tom Pepe]
And I keep tryin', giving you my soul but I know it ain't the one that you buying
And I keep runnin', feeling all alone but I know I didn't come here with nothing
And I keep tryin', giving you the real yo I feel what I know that you lying
And I keep tryin', giving you my soul but I know it ain't the one that you buying
And I keep tryin', yo I keep tryin'

300,"Beware Of My Crew (From ""A Thin Line Between Love And Hate"")","English Bards And Scotch Reviewers [1]

Still [2] must I hear?—shall hoarse [3] FITZGERALD bawl
His creaking couplets in a tavern hall,
And I not sing, lest, haply, Scotch Reviews
Should dub me scribbler, and denounce my Muse?
Prepare for rhyme—I'll publish, right or wrong:
Fools are my theme, let Satire be my song. [i]
Oh! Nature's noblest gift—my grey goose-quill!
Slave of my thoughts, obedient to my will,
Torn from thy parent bird to form a pen,
That mighty instrument of little men!

The pen! foredoomed to aid the mental throes
Of brains that labour, big with Verse or Prose;
Though Nymphs forsake, and Critics may deride,
The Lover's solace, and the Author's pride.
What Wits! what Poets dost thou daily raise!
How frequent is thy use, how small thy praise!
Condemned at length to be forgotten quite,
With all the pages which 'twas thine to write.
But thou, at least, mine own especial pen! [ii]
Once laid aside, but now assumed again,

Our task complete, like Hamet's [4] shall be free;
Though spurned by others, yet beloved by me:
Then let us soar to-day; no common theme,
No Eastern vision, no distempered dream [5]
Inspires—our path, though full of thorns, is plain;
Smooth be the verse, and easy be the strain.
When Vice triumphant holds her sov'reign sway,
Obey'd by all who nought beside obey; [iii]
When Folly, frequent harbinger of crime,
Bedecks her cap with bells of every Clime; [iv]

When knaves and fools combined o'er all prevail,
And weigh their Justice in a Golden Scale; [v]
E'en then the boldest start from public sneers,
Afraid of Shame, unknown to other fears,
More darkly sin, by Satire kept in awe,
And shrink from Ridicule, though not from Law.
Such is the force of Wit! I but not belong
To me the arrows of satiric song;
The royal vices of our age demand
A keener weapon, and a mightier hand. [vi]

Still there are follies, e'en for me to chase,
And yield at least amusement in the race:
Laugh when I laugh, I seek no other fame,
The cry is up, and scribblers are my game:
Speed, Pegasus!—ye strains of great and small,
Ode! Epic! Elegy!—have at you all!
I, too, can scrawl, and once upon a time
I poured along the town a flood of rhyme,
A schoolboy freak, unworthy praise or blame;
I printed—older children do the same.

'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;
A Book's a Book, altho' there's nothing in't.
Not that a Title's sounding charm can save [vii]
Or scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave:
This LAMB [6] must own, since his patrician name
Failed to preserve the spurious Farce from shame. [7]
No matter, GEORGE continues still to write, [8]
Tho' now the name is veiled from public sight.
Moved by the great example, I pursue
The self-same road, but make my own review:

Not seek great JEFFREY'S, yet like him will be
Self-constituted Judge of Poesy.
A man must serve his time to every trade
Save Censure—Critics all are ready made.
Take hackneyed jokes from MILLER, [9] got by rote,
With just enough of learning to misquote;
A man well skilled to find, or forge a fault;
A turn for punning—call it Attic salt;
To JEFFREY go, be silent and discreet,
His pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet:

Fear not to lie,'twill seem a sharper hit; [viii]
Shrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;
Care not for feeling—pass your proper jest,
And stand a Critic, hated yet caress'd.
And shall we own such judgment? no—as soon
Seek roses in December—ice in June;
Hope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff,
Believe a woman or an epitaph,
Or any other thing that's false, before
You trust in Critics, who themselves are sore;

Or yield one single thought to be misled
By JEFFREY'S heart, or LAMB'S Boeotian head. [10]
To these young tyrants, by themselves misplaced,
Combined usurpers on the Throne of Taste;
To these, when Authors bend in humble awe,
And hail their voice as Truth, their word as Law;
While these are Censors, 'twould be sin to spare; [11]
While such are Critics, why should I forbear?
But yet, so near all modern worthies run,
'Tis doubtful whom to seek, or whom to shun;

Nor know we when to spare, or where to strike,
Our Bards and Censors are so much alike.
Then should you ask me, [12] why I venture o'er
The path which POPE and GIFFORD [13] trod before;
If not yet sickened, you can still proceed;
Go on; my rhyme will tell you as you read.
""But hold!"" exclaims a friend,—""here's some neglect:
This—that—and t'other line seem incorrect.""
What then? the self-same blunder Pope has got,
And careless Dryden—""Aye, but Pye has not:""—

Indeed!—'tis granted, faith!—but what care I?
Better to err with POPE, than shine with PYE. [14]
Time was, ere yet in these degenerate days [15]
Ignoble themes obtained mistaken praise,
When Sense and Wit with Poesy allied,
No fabled Graces, flourished side by side,
From the same fount their inspiration drew,
And, reared by Taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.
Then, in this happy Isle, a POPE'S pure strain
Sought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain;

A polished nation's praise aspired to claim,
And raised the people's, as the poet's fame.
Like him great DRYDEN poured the tide of song,
In stream less smooth, indeed, yet doubly strong.
Then CONGREVE'S scenes could cheer, or OTWAY'S melt; [16]
For Nature then an English audience felt—
But why these names, or greater still, retrace,
When all to feebler Bards resign their place?
Yet to such times our lingering looks are cast,
When taste and reason with those times are past.

Now look around, and turn each trifling page,
Survey the precious works that please the age;
This truth at least let Satire's self allow,
No dearth of Bards can be complained of now. [ix]
The loaded Press beneath her labour groans, [x]
And Printers' devils shake their weary bones;
While SOUTHEY'S Epics cram the creaking shelves, [xi]
And LITTLE'S Lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves. [17]
Thus saith the Preacher: ""Nought beneath the sun
Is new,"" [18] yet still from change to change we run.

What varied wonders tempt us as they pass!
The Cow-pox, Tractors, Galvanism, and Gas, [19]
In turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,
Till the swoln bubble bursts—and all is air!
Nor less new schools of Poetry arise,
Where dull pretenders grapple for the prize:
O'er Taste awhile these Pseudo-bards prevail; [xii]
Each country Book-club bows the knee to Baal,
And, hurling lawful Genius from the throne,
Erects a shrine and idol of its own; [xiii]

Some leaden calf—but whom it matters not,
From soaring SOUTHEY, down to groveling STOTT. [20]
Behold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,
For notice eager, pass in long review:
Each spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,
And Rhyme and Blank maintain an equal race;
Sonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;
And Tales of Terror [21] jostle on the road;
Immeasurable measures move along;
For simpering Folly loves a varied song,

To strange, mysterious Dulness still the friend,
Admires the strain she cannot comprehend.
Thus Lays of Minstrels [22]—may they be the last!—
On half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast.
While mountain spirits prate to river sprites,
That dames may listen to the sound at nights;
And goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's [23] brood
Decoy young Border-nobles through the wood,
And skip at every step, Lord knows how high,
And frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why;

While high-born ladies in their magic cell,
Forbidding Knights to read who cannot spell,
Despatch a courier to a wizard's grave,
And fight with honest men to shield a knave.
Next view in state, proud prancing on his roan,
The golden-crested haughty Marmion,
Now forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,
Not quite a Felon, yet but half a Knight. [xiv]
The gibbet or the field prepared to grace;
A mighty mixture of the great and base.

And think'st thou, SCOTT! by vain conceit perchance,
On public taste to foist thy stale romance,
Though MURRAY with his MILLER may combine
To yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line? [24]
No! when the sons of song descend to trade,
Their bays are sear, their former laurels fade,
Let such forego the poet's sacred name,
Who rack their brains for lucre, not for fame:
Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain! [25]
And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain! 180
Such be their meed, such still the just reward [xv]
Of prostituted Muse and hireling bard!
For this we spurn Apollo's venal son,
And bid a long ""good night to Marmion."" [26]
These are the themes that claim our plaudits now;
These are the Bards to whom the Muse must bow;
While MILTON, DRYDEN, POPE, alike forgot,
Resign their hallowed Bays to WALTER SCOTT.
The time has been, when yet the Muse was young,
When HOMER swept the lyre, and MARO sung,

An Epic scarce ten centuries could claim,
While awe-struck nations hailed the magic name:
The work of each immortal Bard appears
The single wonder of a thousand years. [27]
Empires have mouldered from the face of earth,
Tongues have expired with those who gave them birth,
Without the glory such a strain can give,
As even in ruin bids the language live.
Not so with us, though minor Bards, content, [xvi]
On one great work a life of labour spent:

With eagle pinion soaring to the skies,
Behold the Ballad-monger SOUTHEY rise!
To him let CAMOËNS, MILTON, TASSO yield,
Whose annual strains, like armies, take the field.
First in the ranks see Joan of Arc advance,
The scourge of England and the boast of France!
Though burnt by wicked BEDFORD for a witch,
Behold her statue placed in Glory's niche;
Her fetters burst, and just released from prison,
A virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.

Next see tremendous Thalaba come on, [28]
Arabia's monstrous, wild, and wond'rous son;
Domdaniel's dread destroyer, who o'erthrew
More mad magicians than the world e'er knew.
Immortal Hero! all thy foes o'ercome,
For ever reign—the rival of Tom Thumb! [29]
Since startled Metre fled before thy face,
Well wert thou doomed the last of all thy race!
Well might triumphant Genii bear thee hence,
Illustrious conqueror of common sense!

Now, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,
Cacique in Mexico, [30] and Prince in Wales;
Tells us strange tales, as other travellers do,
More old than Mandeville's, and not so true.
Oh, SOUTHEY! SOUTHEY! [31] cease thy varied song!
A bard may chaunt too often and too long:
As thou art strong in verse, in mercy, spare!
A fourth, alas! were more than we could bear.
But if, in spite of all the world can say,
Thou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way;

If still in Berkeley-Ballads most uncivil,
Thou wilt devote old women to the devil, [32]
The babe unborn thy dread intent may rue:
""God help thee,"" SOUTHEY, [33] and thy readers too.
Next comes the dull disciple of thy school, [34]
That mild apostate from poetic rule,
The simple WORDSWORTH, framer of a lay
As soft as evening in his favourite May,
Who warns his friend ""to shake off toil and trouble,
And quit his books, for fear of growing double;"" [35]

Who, both by precept and example, shows
That prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;
Convincing all, by demonstration plain,
Poetic souls delight in prose insane;
And Christmas stories tortured into rhyme
Contain the essence of the true sublime.
Thus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,
The idiot mother of ""an idiot Boy;""
A moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way,
And, like his bard, confounded night with day [36]

So close on each pathetic part he dwells,
And each adventure so sublimely tells,
That all who view the ""idiot in his glory""
Conceive the Bard the hero of the story.
Shall gentle COLERIDGE pass unnoticed here, [37]
To turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?
Though themes of innocence amuse him best,
Yet still Obscurity's a welcome guest.
If Inspiration should her aid refuse
To him who takes a Pixy for a muse, [38]

Yet none in lofty numbers can surpass
The bard who soars to elegize an ass:
So well the subject suits his noble mind, [xvii]
He brays, the Laureate of the long-eared kind. [xviii]
Oh! wonder-working LEWIS! [39] Monk, or Bard,
Who fain would make Parnassus a church-yard! [xix]
Lo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow,
Thy Muse a Sprite, Apollo's sexton thou!
Whether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,
By gibb'ring spectres hailed, thy kindred band;

Or tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,
To please the females of our modest age;
All hail, M.P.! [40] from whose infernal brain
Thin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;
At whose command ""grim women"" throng in crowds,
And kings of fire, of water, and of clouds,
With ""small grey men,""—""wild yagers,"" and what not,
To crown with honour thee and WALTER SCOTT:
Again, all hail! if tales like thine may please,
St. Luke alone can vanquish the disease:

Even Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell,
And in thy skull discern a deeper Hell.
Who in soft guise, surrounded by a choir
Of virgins melting, not to Vesta's fire,
With sparkling eyes, and cheek by passion flushed
Strikes his wild lyre, whilst listening dames are hushed?
'Tis LITTLE! young Catullus of his day,
As sweet, but as immoral, in his Lay!
Grieved to condemn, the Muse must still be just,
Nor spare melodious advocates of lust.

Pure is the flame which o'er her altar burns;
From grosser incense with disgust she turns
Yet kind to youth, this expiation o'er,
She bids thee ""mend thy line, and sin no more."" [xx]
For thee, translator of the tinsel song,
To whom such glittering ornaments belong,
Hibernian STRANGFORD! with thine eyes of blue, [41]
And boasted locks of red or auburn hue,
Whose plaintive strain each love-sick Miss admires,
And o'er harmonious fustian half expires, [xxi]

Learn, if thou canst, to yield thine author's sense,
Nor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence.
Think'st thou to gain thy verse a higher place,
By dressing Camoëns [42] in a suit of lace?
Mend, STRANGFORD! mend thy morals and thy taste;
Be warm, but pure; be amorous, but be chaste:
Cease to deceive; thy pilfered harp restore,
Nor teach the Lusian Bard to copy MOORE.
Behold—Ye Tarts!—one moment spare the text! [xxii]—
HAYLEY'S last work, and worst—until his next;

Whether he spin poor couplets into plays,
Or damn the dead with purgatorial praise, [43]
His style in youth or age is still the same,
For ever feeble and for ever tame.
Triumphant first see ""Temper's Triumphs"" shine!
At least I'm sure they triumphed over mine.
Of ""Music's Triumphs,"" all who read may swear
That luckless Music never triumph'd there. [44]
Moravians, rise! bestow some meet reward [45]
On dull devotion—Lo! the Sabbath Bard,

Sepulchral GRAHAME, [46] pours his notes sublime
In mangled prose, nor e'en aspires to rhyme;
Breaks into blank the Gospel of St. Luke, [xxiii]
And boldly pilfers from the Pentateuch;
And, undisturbed by conscientious qualms,
Perverts the Prophets, and purloins the Psalms.
Hail, Sympathy! thy soft idea brings"" [xxiv]
A thousand visions of a thousand things,
And shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years, [xxv]
The maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers. 330
And art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles! [47]
Thou first, great oracle of tender souls?
Whether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief, [xxvi]
The fall of empires, or a yellow leaf;
Whether thy muse most lamentably tells
What merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells, [xxvii]
Or, still in bells delighting, finds a friend
In every chime that jingled from Ostend;
Ah! how much juster were thy Muse's hap,
If to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap! [xxviii]

Delightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest,
All love thy strain, but children like it best.
'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song,
To soothe the mania of the amorous throng!
With thee our nursery damsels shed their tears,
Ere Miss as yet completes her infant years:
But in her teens thy whining powers are vain;
She quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain.
Now to soft themes thou scornest to confine [xxix]
The lofty numbers of a harp like thine;

""Awake a louder and a loftier strain,"" [48]
Such as none heard before, or will again!
Where all discoveries jumbled from the flood,
Since first the leaky ark reposed in mud,
By more or less, are sung in every book,
From Captain Noah down to Captain Cook.
Nor this alone—but, pausing on the road,
The Bard sighs forth a gentle episode, [xxx] [49]
And gravely tells—attend, each beauteous Miss!—
When first Madeira trembled to a kiss. 360
Bowles! in thy memory let this precept dwell,
Stick to thy Sonnets, Man!—at least they sell.
But if some new-born whim, or larger bribe,
Prompt thy crude brain, and claim thee for a scribe:
If 'chance some bard, though once by dunces feared,
Now, prone in dust, can only be revered;
If Pope, whose fame and genius, from the first, [xxxi]
Have foiled the best of critics, needs the worst,
Do thou essay: each fault, each failing scan;
The first of poets was, alas! but man.

Rake from each ancient dunghill ev'ry pearl,
Consult Lord Fanny, and confide in CURLL; [50]
Let all the scandals of a former age
Perch on thy pen, and flutter o'er thy page;
Affect a candour which thou canst not feel,
Clothe envy in a garb of honest zeal;
Write, as if St. John's soul could still inspire,
And do from hate what MALLET [51] did for hire.
Oh! hadst thou lived in that congenial time
To rave with DENNIS, and with RALPH to rhyme; [52]

Thronged with the rest around his living head,
Not raised thy hoof against the lion dead,
A meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains,
And linked thee to the Dunciad for thy pains. [53]
Another Epic! Who inflicts again
More books of blank upon the sons of men?
Boeotian COTTLE, rich Bristowa's boast,
Imports old stories from the Cambrian coast,
And sends his goods to market—all alive!
Lines forty thousand, Cantos twenty-five!

Fresh fish from Hippocrene! [54] who'll buy? who'll buy?
The precious bargain's cheap—in faith, not I.
Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat, [xxxii]
Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat;
If Commerce fills the purse, she clogs the brain,
And AMOS COTTLE strikes the Lyre in vain.
In him an author's luckless lot behold!
Condemned to make the books which once he sold.
Oh, AMOS COTTLE!—Phoebus! what a name
To fill the speaking-trump of future fame!—

Oh, AMOS COTTLE! for a moment think
What meagre profits spring from pen and ink!
When thus devoted to poetic dreams,
Who will peruse thy prostituted reams?
Oh! pen perverted! paper misapplied!
Had COTTLE [55] still adorned the counter's side,
Bent o'er the desk, or, born to useful toils,
Been taught to make the paper which he soils,
Ploughed, delved, or plied the oar with lusty limb,
He had not sung of Wales, nor I of him.

As Sisyphus against the infernal steep
Rolls the huge rock whose motions ne'er may sleep,
So up thy hill, ambrosial Richmond! heaves
Dull MAURICE [56] all his granite weight of leaves:
Smooth, solid monuments of mental pain!
The petrifactions of a plodding brain,
That, ere they reach the top, fall lumbering back again.
With broken lyre and cheek serenely pale,
Lo! sad Alcæus wanders down the vale;
Though fair they rose, and might have bloomed at last,

His hopes have perished by the northern blast:
Nipped in the bud by Caledonian gales,
His blossoms wither as the blast prevails!
O'er his lost works let classic SHEFFIELD weep;
May no rude hand disturb their early sleep! [57]
Yet say! why should the Bard, at once, resign [xxxiii]
His claim to favour from the sacred Nine?
For ever startled by the mingled howl
Of Northern Wolves, that still in darkness prowl;
A coward Brood, which mangle as they prey,

By hellish instinct, all that cross their way;
Aged or young, the living or the dead,"" [xxxiv]
No mercy find-these harpies must be fed.
Why do the injured unresisting yield
The calm possession of their native field?
Why tamely thus before their fangs retreat,
Nor hunt the blood-hounds back to Arthur's Seat? [58]
Health to immortal JEFFREY! once, in name,
England could boast a judge almost the same; [59]
In soul so like, so merciful, yet just,
Some think that Satan has resigned his trust,
And given the Spirit to the world again,
To sentence Letters, as he sentenced men.
With hand less mighty, but with heart as black,
With voice as willing to decree the rack;
Bred in the Courts betimes, though all that law
As yet hath taught him is to find a flaw,—
Since well instructed in the patriot school
To rail at party, though a party tool—
Who knows? if chance his patrons should restore

Back to the sway they forfeited before,
His scribbling toils some recompense may meet,
And raise this Daniel to the Judgment-Seat. [60]
Let JEFFREY'S shade indulge the pious hope,
And greeting thus, present him with a rope:
""Heir to my virtues! man of equal mind!
Skilled to condemn as to traduce mankind,
This cord receive! for thee reserved with care,
To wield in judgment, and at length to wear.""
Health to great JEFFREY! Heaven preserve his life,

To flourish on the fertile shores of Fife,
And guard it sacred in its future wars,
Since authors sometimes seek the field of Mars!
Can none remember that eventful day, [xxxv] [61]
That ever-glorious, almost fatal fray,
When LITTLE'S leadless pistol met his eye, [62]
And Bow-street Myrmidons stood laughing by?
Oh, day disastrous! on her firm-set rock,
Dunedin's castle felt a secret shock;
Dark rolled the sympathetic waves of Forth,

Low groaned the startled whirlwinds of the north;
TWEED ruffled half his waves to form a tear,
The other half pursued his calm career; [63]
ARTHUR'S steep summit nodded to its base,
The surly Tolbooth scarcely kept her place.
The Tolbooth felt—for marble sometimes can,
On such occasions, feel as much as man—
The Tolbooth felt defrauded of his charms,
If JEFFREY died, except within her arms: [64]

Nay last, not least, on that portentous morn,
The sixteenth story, where himself was born,
His patrimonial garret, fell to ground,
And pale Edina shuddered at the sound:
Strewed were the streets around with milk-white reams,
Flowed all the Canongate with inky streams;
This of his candour seemed the sable dew,
That of his valour showed the bloodless hue;
And all with justice deemed the two combined
The mingled emblems of his mighty mind.
But Caledonia's goddess hovered o'er

The field, and saved him from the wrath of Moore;
From either pistol snatched the vengeful lead,
And straight restored it to her favourite's head;
That head, with greater than magnetic power,
Caught it, as Danäe caught the golden shower,
And, though the thickening dross will scarce refine,
Augments its ore, and is itself a mine.
""My son,"" she cried, ""ne'er thirst for gore again,
Resign the pistol and resume the pen;
O'er politics and poesy preside,

Boast of thy country, and Britannia's guide!
For long as Albion's heedless sons submit,
Or Scottish taste decides on English wit,
So long shall last thine unmolested reign,
Nor any dare to take thy name in vain.
Behold, a chosen band shall aid thy plan,
And own thee chieftain of the critic clan.
First in the oat-fed phalanx [65] shall be seen
The travelled Thane, Athenian Aberdeen. [66]
HERBERT shall wield THOR'S hammer, [67] and sometimes

In gratitude, thou'lt praise his rugged rhymes.
Smug SYDNEY [68] too thy bitter page shall seek,
And classic HALLAM, [69] much renowned for Greek;
SCOTT may perchance his name and influence lend,
And paltry PILLANS [70] shall traduce his friend;
While gay Thalia's luckless votary, LAMB, [xxxvi] [71]
Damned like the Devil—Devil-like will damn.
Known be thy name! unbounded be thy sway!
Thy HOLLAND'S banquets shall each toil repay!
While grateful Britain yields the praise she owes

To HOLLAND'S hirelings and to Learning's foes.
Yet mark one caution ere thy next Review
Spread its light wings of Saffron and of Blue,
Beware lest blundering BROUGHAM [72] destroy the sale,
Turn Beef to Bannocks, Cauliflowers to Kail.""
Thus having said, the kilted Goddess kist
Her son, and vanished in a Scottish mist. [73]
Then prosper, JEFFREY! pertest of the train [74]
Whom Scotland pampers with her fiery grain!
Whatever blessing waits a genuine Scot, 530
In double portion swells thy glorious lot;
For thee Edina culls her evening sweets,
And showers their odours on thy candid sheets,
Whose Hue and Fragrance to thy work adhere—
This scents its pages, and that gilds its rear. [75]
Lo! blushing Itch, coy nymph, enamoured grown,
Forsakes the rest, and cleaves to thee alone,
And, too unjust to other Pictish men,
Enjoys thy person, and inspires thy pen!
Illustrious HOLLAND! hard would be his lot,

His hirelings mentioned, and himself forgot! [76]
HOLLAND, with HENRY PETTY [77] at his back,
The whipper-in and huntsman of the pack.
Blest be the banquets spread at Holland House,
Where Scotchmen feed, and Critics may carouse!
Long, long beneath that hospitable roof [xxxvii]
Shall Grub-street dine, while duns are kept aloof.
See honest HALLAM [78] lay aside his fork,
Resume his pen, review his Lordship's work,
And, grateful for the dainties on his plate, [xxxviii]

Declare his landlord can at least translate! [79]
Dunedin! view thy children with delight,
They write for food—and feed because they write: [xxxix]
And lest, when heated with the unusual grape,
Some glowing thoughts should to the press escape,
And tinge with red the female reader's cheek,
My lady skims the cream of each critique;
Breathes o'er the page her purity of soul,
Reforms each error, and refines the whole. [80]
Now to the Drama turn—Oh! motley sight!

What precious scenes the wondering eyes invite:
Puns, and a Prince within a barrel pent, [xl] [81]
And Dibdin's nonsense yield complete content. [82]
Though now, thank Heaven! the Rosciomania's o'er. [83]
And full-grown actors are endured once more;
Yet what avail their vain attempts to please,
While British critics suffer scenes like these;
While REYNOLDS vents his ""'dammes!'"" ""poohs!"" and
""zounds!"" [xli] [84]

And common-place and common sense confounds?
While KENNEY'S [85] ""World""—ah! where is KENNEY'S wit? [xlii]— 570
Tires the sad gallery, lulls the listless Pit;
And BEAUMONT'S pilfered Caratach affords
A tragedy complete in all but words? [xliii]
Who but must mourn, while these are all the rage
The degradation of our vaunted stage?
Heavens! is all sense of shame and talent gone?
Have we no living Bard of merit?—none?
Awake, GEORGE COLMAN! [86] CUMBERLAND, awake![87]
Ring the alarum bell! let folly quake!
Oh! SHERIDAN! if aught can move thy pen,

Let Comedy assume her throne again; [xliv]
Abjure the mummery of German schools;
Leave new Pizarros to translating fools; [88]
Give, as thy last memorial to the age,
One classic drama, and reform the stage.
Gods! o'er those boards shall Folly rear her head,
Where GARRICK trod, and SIDDONS lives to tread? [xlv] [89]
On those shall Farce display buffoonery's mask,
And HOOK conceal his heroes in a cask? [90]
Shall sapient managers new scenes produce

From CHERRY, [91] SKEFFINGTON, [92] and Mother GOOSE? [xlvi] [93]
While SHAKESPEARE, OTWAY, MASSINGER, forgot,
On stalls must moulder, or in closets rot?
Lo! with what pomp the daily prints proclaim
The rival candidates for Attic fame!
In grim array though LEWIS' spectres rise,
Still SKEFFINGTON and GOOSE divide the prize.
And sure 'great' Skeffington must claim our praise,
For skirtless coats and skeletons of plays
Renowned alike; whose genius ne'er confines

Her flight to garnish Greenwood's gay designs; [xlvii] [94]
Nor sleeps with ""Sleeping Beauties,"" but anon
In five facetious acts comes thundering on.
While poor John Bull, bewildered with the scene,
Stares, wondering what the devil it can mean;
But as some hands applaud, a venal few!
Rather than sleep, why John applauds it too.
Such are we now. Ah! wherefore should we turn
To what our fathers were, unless to mourn?
Degenerate Britons! are ye dead to shame,

Or, kind to dulness, do you fear to blame?
Well may the nobles of our present race
Watch each distortion of a NALDI'S face;
Well may they smile on Italy's buffoons,
And worship CATALANI's pantaloons, [95]
Since their own Drama yields no fairer trace
Of wit than puns, of humour than grimace. [96]
Then let Ausonia, skill'd in every art
To soften manners, but corrupt the heart,
Pour her exotic follies o'er the town,

To sanction Vice, and hunt Decorum down:
Let wedded strumpets languish o'er DESHAYES,
And bless the promise which his form displays;
While Gayton bounds before th' enraptured looks
Of hoary Marquises, and stripling Dukes:
Let high-born lechers eye the lively Presle
Twirl her light limbs, that spurn the needless veil;
Let Angiolini bare her breast of snow,
Wave the white arm, and point the pliant toe;
Collini trill her love-inspiring song,

Strain her fair neck, and charm the listening throng!
Whet [97] not your scythe, Suppressors of our Vice!
Reforming Saints! too delicately nice!
By whose decrees, our sinful souls to save,
No Sunday tankards foam, no barbers shave;
And beer undrawn, and beards unmown, display
Your holy reverence for the Sabbath-day.
Or hail at once the patron and the pile
Of vice and folly, Greville and Argyle! [98]
Where yon proud palace, Fashion's hallow'd fane,

Spreads wide her portals for the motley train,
Behold the new Petronius [99] of the day, [xlviii]
Our arbiter of pleasure and of play!
There the hired eunuch, the Hesperian choir,
The melting lute, the soft lascivious lyre,
The song from Italy, the step from France,
The midnight orgy, and the mazy dance,
The smile of beauty, and the flush of wine,
For fops, fools, gamesters, knaves, and Lords combine:
Each to his humour—Comus all allows; 650
Champaign, dice, music, or your neighbour's spouse.
Talk not to us, ye starving sons of trade!
Of piteous ruin, which ourselves have made;
In Plenty's sunshine Fortune's minions bask,
Nor think of Poverty, except ""en masque,"" [100]
When for the night some lately titled ass
Appears the beggar which his grandsire was,
The curtain dropped, the gay Burletta o'er,
The audience take their turn upon the floor:
Now round the room the circling dow'gers sweep,

Now in loose waltz the thin-clad daughters leap;
The first in lengthened line majestic swim,
The last display the free unfettered limb!
Those for Hibernia's lusty sons repair
With art the charms which Nature could not spare;
These after husbands wing their eager flight,
Nor leave much mystery for the nuptial night.
Oh! blest retreats of infamy and ease,
Where, all forgotten but the power to please,
Each maid may give a loose to genial thought,

Each swain may teach new systems, or be taught:
There the blithe youngster, just returned from Spain,
Cuts the light pack, or calls the rattling main;
The jovial Caster's set, and seven's the Nick,
Or—done!—a thousand on the coming trick!
If, mad with loss, existence 'gins to tire,
And all your hope or wish is to expire,
Here's POWELL'S [101] pistol ready for your life,
And, kinder still, two PAGETS for your wife: [xlix]
Fit consummation of an earthly race

Begun in folly, ended in disgrace,
While none but menials o'er the bed of death,
Wash thy red wounds, or watch thy wavering breath;
Traduced by liars, and forgot by all,
The mangled victim of a drunken brawl,
To live like CLODIUS, [102] and like FALKLAND fall.[103]
Truth! rouse some genuine Bard, and guide his hand
To drive this pestilence from out the land.
E'en I—least thinking of a thoughtless throng,
Just skilled to know the right and choose the wrong,

Freed at that age when Reason's shield is lost,
To fight my course through Passion's countless host, [104]
Whom every path of Pleasure's flow'ry way
Has lured in turn, and all have led astray—
E'en I must raise my voice, e'en I must feel
Such scenes, such men, destroy the public weal:
Altho' some kind, censorious friend will say,
""What art thou better, meddling fool, [105] than they?""
And every Brother Rake will smile to see
That miracle, a Moralist in me.

No matter—when some Bard in virtue strong,
Gifford perchance, shall raise the chastening song,
Then sleep my pen for ever! and my voice
Be only heard to hail him, and rejoice,
Rejoice, and yield my feeble praise, though I
May feel the lash that Virtue must apply.
As for the smaller fry, who swarm in shoals
From silly HAFIZ up to simple BOWLES, [106]
Why should we call them from their dark abode,
In Broad St. Giles's or Tottenham-Road?

Or (since some men of fashion nobly dare
To scrawl in verse) from Bond-street or the Square? [l]
If things of Ton their harmless lays indite,
Most wisely doomed to shun the public sight,
What harm? in spite of every critic elf,
Sir T. may read his stanzas to himself;
MILES ANDREWS [107] still his strength in couplets try,
And live in prologues, though his dramas die.
Lords too are Bards: such things at times befall,
And 'tis some praise in Peers to write at all.

Yet, did or Taste or Reason sway the times,
Ah! who would take their titles with their rhymes? [108]
ROSCOMMON! [109] SHEFFIELD! [110] with your spirits fled, [111]
No future laurels deck a noble head;
No Muse will cheer, with renovating smile,
The paralytic puling of CARLISLE. [li] [112]
The puny schoolboy and his early lay
Men pardon, if his follies pass away;
But who forgives the Senior's ceaseless verse
Whose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse?

What heterogeneous honours deck the Peer!
Lord, rhymester, petit-maître, pamphleteer! [113]
So dull in youth, so drivelling in his age,
His scenes alone had damned our sinking stage;
But Managers for once cried, ""Hold, enough!""
Nor drugged their audience with the tragic stuff.
Yet at their judgment let his Lordship laugh, [lii]
And case his volumes in congenial calf;
Yes! doff that covering, where Morocco shines,
And hang a calf-skin on those recreant lines. [114]

With you, ye Druids! rich in native lead,
Who daily scribble for your daily bread:
With you I war not: GIFFORD'S heavy hand
Has crushed, without remorse, your numerous band.
On ""All the Talents"" vent your venal spleen; [115]
Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.
Let Monodies on Fox regale your crew,
And Melville's Mantle [116] prove a Blanket too!
One common Lethe waits each hapless Bard,
And, peace be with you! 'tis your best reward.

Such damning fame; as Dunciads only give [liii]
Could bid your lines beyond a morning live;
But now at once your fleeting labours close,
With names of greater note in blest repose.
Far be't from me unkindly to upbraid
The lovely ROSA'S prose in masquerade,
Whose strains, the faithful echoes of her mind,
Leave wondering comprehension far behind. [117]
Though Crusca's bards no more our journals fill, [118]
Some stragglers skirmish round the columns still;

Last of the howling host which once was Bell's, [liv]
Matilda snivels yet, and Hafiz yells;
And Merry's [119] metaphors appear anew,
Chained to the signature of O. P. Q. [120]
When some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,
Employs a pen less pointed than his awl,
Leaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes,
St. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the Muse,
Heavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud!
How ladies read, and Literati laud! [121]

If chance some wicked wag should pass his jest,
'Tis sheer ill-nature—don't the world know best?
Genius must guide when wits admire the rhyme,
And CAPEL LOFFT [122] declares 'tis quite sublime.
Hear, then, ye happy sons of needless trade!
Swains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade!
Lo! BURNS and BLOOMFIELD, nay, a greater far,
GIFFORD was born beneath an adverse star,
Forsook the labours of a servile state,
Stemmed the rude storm, and triumphed over Fate:

Then why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you,
BLOOMFIELD! why not on brother Nathan too? [123]
Him too the Mania, not the Muse, has seized;
Not inspiration, but a mind diseased:
And now no Boor can seek his last abode,
No common be inclosed without an ode.
Oh! since increased refinement deigns to smile
On Britain's sons, and bless our genial Isle,
Let Poesy go forth, pervade the whole,
Alike the rustic, and mechanic soul!

Ye tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong,
Compose at once a slipper and a song;
So shall the fair your handywork peruse,
Your sonnets sure shall please—perhaps your shoes.
May Moorland weavers [124] boast Pindaric skill,
And tailors' lays be longer than their bill!
While punctual beaux reward the grateful notes,
And pay for poems—when they pay for coats.
To the famed throng now paid the tribute due, [lv]
Neglected Genius! let me turn to you.

Come forth, oh CAMPBELL! give thy talents scope;
Who dares aspire if thou must cease to hope?
And thou, melodious ROGERS! rise at last,
Recall the pleasing memory of the past; [125]
Arise! let blest remembrance still inspire,
And strike to wonted tones thy hallowed lyre;
Restore Apollo to his vacant throne,
Assert thy country's honour and thine own.
What! must deserted Poesy still weep
Where her last hopes with pious COWPER sleep?

Unless, perchance, from his cold bier she turns,
To deck the turf that wraps her minstrel, BURNS!
No! though contempt hath marked the spurious brood,
The race who rhyme from folly, or for food,
Yet still some genuine sons 'tis hers to boast,
Who, least affecting, still affect the most: [lvi]
Feel as they write, and write but as they feel—
Bear witness GIFFORD, [126] SOTHEBY, [127] MACNEIL. [128]
""Why slumbers GIFFORD?"" once was asked in vain;
Why slumbers GIFFORD? let us ask again. [129]

Are there no follies for his pen to purge?
Are there no fools whose backs demand the scourge?
Are there no sins for Satire's Bard to greet?
Stalks not gigantic Vice in every street?
Shall Peers or Princes tread pollution's path,
And 'scape alike the Laws and Muse's wrath?
Nor blaze with guilty glare through future time,
Eternal beacons of consummate crime?
Arouse thee, GIFFORD! be thy promise claimed,
Make bad men better, or at least ashamed.

Unhappy WHITE! [130] while life was in its spring,
And thy young Muse just waved her joyous wing,
The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away, [lvii] [131]
Which else had sounded an immortal lay.
Oh! what a noble heart was here undone,
When Science' self destroyed her favourite son!
Yes, she too much indulged thy fond pursuit,
She sowed the seeds, but Death has reaped the fruit.
'Twas thine own Genius gave the final blow,
And helped to plant the wound that laid thee low:

So the struck Eagle, stretched upon the plain,
No more through rolling clouds to soar again,
Viewed his own feather on the fatal dart,
And winged the shaft that quivered in his heart;
Keen were his pangs, but keener far to feel
He nursed the pinion which impelled the steel;
While the same plumage that had warmed his nest
Drank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast.
There be who say, in these enlightened days,
That splendid lies are all the poet's praise;

That strained Invention, ever on the wing,
Alone impels the modern Bard to sing:
Tis true, that all who rhyme—nay, all who write,
Shrink from that fatal word to Genius—Trite;
Yet Truth sometimes will lend her noblest fires,
And decorate the verse herself inspires:
This fact in Virtue's name let CRABBE [132] attest;
Though Nature's sternest Painter, yet the best.
And here let SHEE [133] and Genius find a place,
Whose pen and pencil yield an equal grace;

To guide whose hand the sister Arts combine,
And trace the Poet's or the Painter's line;
Whose magic touch can bid the canvas glow,
Or pour the easy rhyme's harmonious flow;
While honours, doubly merited, attend [lviii]
The Poet's rival, but the Painter's friend.
Blest is the man who dares approach the bower
Where dwelt the Muses at their natal hour;
Whose steps have pressed, whose eye has marked afar,
The clime that nursed the sons of song and war,

The scenes which Glory still must hover o'er,
Her place of birth, her own Achaian shore.
But doubly blest is he whose heart expands
With hallowed feelings for those classic lands;
Who rends the veil of ages long gone by,
And views their remnants with a poet's eye!
WRIGHT! [134] 'twas thy happy lot at once to view
Those shores of glory, and to sing them too;
And sure no common Muse inspired thy pen
To hail the land of Gods and Godlike men. 880
And you, associate Bards! [135] who snatched to light [lvix]
Those gems too long withheld from modern sight;
Whose mingling taste combined to cull the wreath
While Attic flowers Aonian odours breathe,
And all their renovated fragrance flung,
To grace the beauties of your native tongue;
Now let those minds, that nobly could transfuse
The glorious Spirit of the Grecian Muse,
Though soft the echo, scorn a borrowed tone: [lx]
Resign Achaia's lyre, and strike your own.

Let these, or such as these, with just applause, [lxi]
Restore the Muse's violated laws;
But not in flimsy DARWIN'S [136] pompous chime, [lxii]
That mighty master of unmeaning rhyme,
Whose gilded cymbals, more adorned than clear,
The eye delighted, but fatigued the ear,
In show the simple lyre could once surpass,
But now, worn down, appear in native brass;
While all his train of hovering sylphs around
Evaporate in similes and sound:

Him let them shun, with him let tinsel die:
False glare attracts, but more offends the eye. [137]
Yet let them not to vulgar WORDSWORTH [138] stoop,
The meanest object of the lowly group,
Whose verse, of all but childish prattle void,
Seems blessed harmony to LAMB and LLOYD: [139]
Let them—but hold, my Muse, nor dare to teach
A strain far, far beyond thy humble reach:
The native genius with their being given
Will point the path, and peal their notes to heaven. 910
And thou, too, SCOTT! [140] resign to minstrels rude
The wilder Slogan of a Border feud:
Let others spin their meagre lines for hire;
Enough for Genius, if itself inspire!
Let SOUTHEY sing, altho' his teeming muse, [lxiii]
Prolific every spring, be too profuse;
Let simple WORDSWORTH [141] chime his childish verse,
And brother COLERIDGE lull the babe at nurse [lxiv]
Let Spectre-mongering LEWIS aim, at most, [lxv]
To rouse the Galleries, or to raise a ghost;

Let MOORE still sigh; let STRANGFORD steal from MOORE, [lxvi]
And swear that CAMOËNS sang such notes of yore;
Let HAYLEY hobble on, MONTGOMERY rave,
And godly GRAHAME chant a stupid stave;
Let sonneteering BOWLES [142] his strains refine,
And whine and whimper to the fourteenth line;
Let STOTT, CARLISLE, [143] MATILDA, and the rest
Of Grub Street, and of Grosvenor Place the best,
Scrawl on, 'till death release us from the strain,
Or Common Sense assert her rights again;

But Thou, with powers that mock the aid of praise,
Should'st leave to humbler Bards ignoble lays:
Thy country's voice, the voice of all the Nine,
Demand a hallowed harp—that harp is thine.
Say! will not Caledonia's annals yield
The glorious record of some nobler field,
Than the vile foray of a plundering clan,
Whose proudest deeds disgrace the name of man?
Or Marmion's acts of darkness, fitter food
For SHERWOOD'S outlaw tales of ROBIN HOOD? [lxvii]

Scotland! still proudly claim thy native Bard,
And be thy praise his first, his best reward!
Yet not with thee alone his name should live,
But own the vast renown a world can give;
Be known, perchance, when Albion is no more,
And tell the tale of what she was before;
To future times her faded fame recall,
And save her glory, though his country fall.
Yet what avails the sanguine Poet's hope,
To conquer ages, and with time to cope?

New eras spread their wings, new nations rise,
And other Victors fill th' applauding skies; [144]
A few brief generations fleet along,
Whose sons forget the Poet and his song:
E'en now, what once-loved Minstrels scarce may claim
The transient mention of a dubious name!
When Fame's loud trump hath blown its noblest blast,
Though long the sound, the echo sleeps at last;
And glory, like the Phoenix [145] midst her fires,
Exhales her odours, blazes, and expires.

Shall hoary Granta call her sable sons,
Expert in science, more expert at puns?
Shall these approach the Muse? ah, no! she flies,
Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize; [lxviii]
Though Printers condescend the press to soil
With rhyme by HOARE, [146] and epic blank by HOYLE: [lxix] [147]
Not him whose page, if still upheld by whist,
Requires no sacred theme to bid us list. [148]
Ye! who in Granta's honours would surpass,
Must mount her Pegasus, a full-grown ass;

A foal well worthy of her ancient Dam,
Whose Helicon [149] is duller than her Cam. [lxx]
There CLARKE, [150] still striving piteously ""to please,"" [lxxi]
Forgetting doggerel leads not to degrees,
A would-be satirist, a hired Buffoon,
A monthly scribbler of some low Lampoon, [151]
Condemned to drudge, the meanest of the mean,
And furbish falsehoods for a magazine,
Devotes to scandal his congenial mind;
Himself a living libel on mankind.

Oh! dark asylum of a Vandal race! [152]
At once the boast of learning, and disgrace!
So lost to Phoebus, that nor Hodgson's [153] verse
Can make thee better, nor poor Hewson's [154] worse. [lxxii]
But where fair Isis rolls her purer wave,
The partial Muse delighted loves to lave;
On her green banks a greener wreath she wove, [lxxiii]
To crown the Bards that haunt her classic grove;
Where RICHARDS wakes a genuine poet's fires,
And modern Britons glory in their Sires. [155] [lxxiv]

For me, who, thus unasked, have dared to tell
My country, what her sons should know too well, [lxxv]
Zeal for her honour bade me here engage [lxxvi]
The host of idiots that infest her age;
No just applause her honoured name shall lose,
As first in freedom, dearest to the Muse.
Oh! would thy bards but emulate thy fame,
And rise more worthy, Albion, of thy name!
What Athens was in science, Rome in power,
What Tyre appeared in her meridian hour,

'Tis thine at once, fair Albion! to have been—
Earth's chief Dictatress, Ocean's lovely Queen: [lxxvii]
But Rome decayed, and Athens strewed the plain,
And Tyre's proud piers lie shattered in the main;
Like these, thy strength may sink, in ruin hurled, [lxxviii]
And Britain fall, the bulwark of the world.
But let me cease, and dread Cassandra's fate,
With warning ever scoffed at, till too late;
To themes less lofty still my lay confine,
And urge thy Bards to gain a name like thine. [156]

Then, hapless Britain! be thy rulers blest,
The senate's oracles, the people's jest!
Still hear thy motley orators dispense
The flowers of rhetoric, though not of sense,
While CANNING'S colleagues hate him for his wit,
And old dame PORTLAND [157] fills the place of PITT.
Yet once again, adieu! ere this the sail
That wafts me hence is shivering in the gale;
And Afric's coast and Calpe's adverse height, [158]
And Stamboul's minarets must greet my sight:

Thence shall I stray through Beauty's native clime, [159]
Where Kaff [160] is clad in rocks, and crowned with snows sublime.
But should I back return, no tempting press [lxxix]
Shall drag my Journal from the desk's recess;
Let coxcombs, printing as they come from far,
Snatch his own wreath of Ridicule from Carr;
Let ABERDEEN and ELGIN [161] still pursue
The shade of fame through regions of Virtù;
Waste useless thousands on their Phidian freaks,
Misshapen monuments and maimed antiques;

And make their grand saloons a general mart
For all the mutilated blocks of art:
Of Dardan tours let Dilettanti tell,
I leave topography to rapid [162] GELL; [163]
And, quite content, no more shall interpose
To stun the public ear—at least with Prose. [lxxx]
Thus far I've held my undisturbed career,
Prepared for rancour, steeled 'gainst selfish fear;
This thing of rhyme I ne'er disdained to own—
Though not obtrusive, yet not quite unknown:

My voice was heard again, though not so loud,
My page, though nameless, never disavowed;
And now at once I tear the veil away:—
Cheer on the pack! the Quarry stands at bay,
Unscared by all the din of MELBOURNE house, [164]
By LAMB'S resentment, or by HOLLAND'S spouse,
By JEFFREY'S harmless pistol, HALLAM'S rage,
Edina's brawny sons and brimstone page.
Our men in buckram shall have blows enough,
And feel they too are ""penetrable stuff:""

And though I hope not hence unscathed to go,
Who conquers me shall find a stubborn foe.
The time hath been, when no harsh sound would fall
From lips that now may seem imbued with gall;
Nor fools nor follies tempt me to despise
The meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes:
But now, so callous grown, so changed since youth,
I've learned to think, and sternly speak the truth;
Learned to deride the critic's starch decree,
And break him on the wheel he meant for me;

To spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss,
Nor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss:
Nay more, though all my rival rhymesters frown,
I too can hunt a Poetaster down;
And, armed in proof, the gauntlet cast at once
To Scotch marauder, and to Southern dunce.
Thus much I've dared; if my incondite lay [lxxx]
Hath wronged these righteous times, let others say:
This, let the world, which knows not how to spare,
Yet rarely blames unjustly, now declare. [165]

Mr. Fitzgerald, facetiously termed by Cobbett the ""Small Beer Poet,"" inflicts his annual tribute of verse on the Literary Fund: not content with writing, he spouts in person, after the company have imbibed a reasonable quantity of bad port, to enable them to sustain the operation.

[William Thomas Fitzgerald (circ. 1759-1829) played the part of unofficial poet laureate. His loyal recitations were reported by the newspapers. He published, 'inter alia', 'Nelson's Triumph' (1798), 'Tears of Hibernia, dispelled by the Union' (1802), and 'Nelson's Tomb' (1806). He owes his fame to the first line of 'English Bards', and the famous parody in 'Rejected Addresses'. The following 'jeux désprits' were transcribed by R. C. Dallas on a blank leaf of a copy of the Fifth Edition:—

""Written on a copy of 'English Bards' at the 'Alfred' by W. T.
Fitzgerald, Esq.—
I find Lord Byron scorns my Muse,
Our Fates are ill agreed;
The Verse is safe, I can't abuse
Those lines, I never read.
Signed W. T. F.""

Answer written on the same page by Lord Byron—

""What's writ on me,"" cries Fitz, ""I never read""!
What's writ by thee, dear Fitz, none will, indeed.
The case stands simply thus, then, honest Fitz,
Thou and thine enemies are fairly quits;
Or rather would be, if for time to come,
They luckily were 'deaf', or thou wert dumb;
But to their pens while scribblers add their tongues.
The Waiter only can escape their lungs. [A]]

[Footnote 6: ""He's a very good fellow; and, except his mother and sister, the best of the set, to my mind.""—B., 1816. [William (1779-1848) and George (1784-1834) Lamb, sons of Sir Peniston Lamb (Viscount Melbourne, 1828), by Elizabeth, only daughter of Sir Ralph Milbanke, were Lady Byron's first cousins. William married, in 1805, Lady Caroline Ponsonby, the writer of 'Glenarvon'. George, who was one of the early contributors to the 'Edinburgh Review', married in 1809 Caroline Rosalie Adelaide St. Jules. At the time of the separation, Lady Caroline Lamb and Mrs. George Lamb warmly espoused Lady Byron's cause, Lady Melbourne and her daughter Lady Cowper (afterwards Lady Palmerston) were rather against than for Lady Byron. William Lamb was discreetly silent, and George Lamb declaimed against Lady Byron, calling her a d——d fool. Hence Lord Byron's praises of George. Cf. line 517 of 'English Bards'.]

""Spurious Brat"" [see variant ii. p. 300], that is the farce; the ingenuous youth who begat it is mentioned more particularly with his offspring in another place. ['Note. MS. M.'] [The farce 'Whistle for It' was performed two or three times at Covent Garden Theatre in 1807.]

[Footnote 10: Messrs. Jeffrey and Lamb are the alpha and omega, the first and last of the 'Edinburgh Review'; the others are mentioned hereafter.

[The MS. Note is as follows:—""Of the young gentlemen who write in the 'E.R.', I have now named the alpha and omega, the first and the last, the best and the worst. The intermediate members are designated with due honour hereafter.""]

[Francis Jeffrey (1773-1850) founded the 'Edinburgh Review' in conjunction with Sydney Smith, Brougham, and Francis Horner, in 1802. In 1803 he succeeded Smith as editor, and conducted the 'Review' till 1829. Independence of publishers and high pay to contributors (""Ten guineas a sheet,"" writes Southey to Scott, June, 1807, ""instead of seven pounds for the 'Annual',"" 'Life and Corr'., iii. 125) distinguished the new journal from the first. Jeffrey was called to the Scottish bar in 1794, and as an advocate was especially successful with juries. He was constantly employed, and won fame and fortune. In 1829 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, and the following year, when the Whigs came into office, he became Lord Advocate. He sat as M.P. twice for Malton (1830-1832), and, afterwards, for Edinburgh. In 1834 he was appointed a Judge of the Court of Sessions, when he took the title of Lord Jeffrey. Byron had attacked Jeffrey in British Bards before his 'Hours of Idleness' had been cut up by the 'Edinburgh', and when the article appeared (Jan. 1808), under the mistaken impression that he was the author, denounced him at large (ll. 460-528) in the first edition of 'English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers'. None the less, the great critic did not fail to do ample justice to the poet's mature work, and won from him repeated acknowledgments of his kindness and generosity. (See 'Edinburgh Review', vol. xxii. p. 416, and Byron's comment in his 'Diary' for March 20,1814; 'Life', p. 232. See, too, 'Hints from Horace', ll. 589-626; and 'Don Juan', canto x. st. 11-16, and canto xii. st. 16. See also Bagehot's 'Literary Studies', vol. i. article I.)]

[Footnote 13: William Gifford (1756-1826), a self-taught scholar, first a ploughboy, then boy on board a Brixham coaster, afterwards shoemaker's apprentice, was sent by friends to Exeter College, Oxford (1779-81). In the 'Baviad' (1794) and the 'Maeviad' (1795) he attacked many of the smaller writers of the day, who were either silly, like the Della Cruscan School, or discreditable, like Williams, who wrote as ""Anthony Pasquin."" In his 'Epistle to Peter Pindar' (1800) he laboured to expose the true character of John Wolcot. As editor of the 'Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner' (November, 1797, to July, 1798), he supported the political views of Canning and his friends. As editor of the 'Quarterly Review', from its foundation (February, 1809) to his resignation in September, 1824, he soon rose to literary eminence by his sound sense and adherence to the best models, though his judgments were sometimes narrow-minded and warped by political prejudice. His editions of 'Massinger' (1805), which superseded that of Monck Mason and Davies (1765), of 'Ben Jonson' (1816), of 'Ford' (1827), are valuable. To his translation of 'Juvenal' (1802) is prefixed his autobiography. His translation of 'Persius' appeared in 1821. To Gifford, Byron usually paid the utmost deference. ""Any suggestion of yours, even if it were conveyed,"" he writes to him, in 1813, ""in the less tender text of the 'Baviad', or a Monck Mason note to Massinger, would be obeyed."" See also his letter (September 20, 1821, 'Life', p.531): ""I know no praise which would compensate me in my own mind for his censure."" Byron was attracted to Gifford, partly by his devotion to the classical models of literature, partly by the outspoken frankness of his literary criticism, partly also, perhaps, by his physical deformity.]

[Footnote 14: Henry James Pye (1745-1813), M.P. for Berkshire, and afterwards Police Magistrate for Westminster, held the office of poet laureate from 1790 till his death in 1813, succeeding Thomas Warton, and succeeded by Southey. He published 'Farringdon Hill' in 1774, The 'Progress of Refinement' in 1783, and a translation of Burger's 'Lenore' in 1795. His name recurs in the 'Vision of Judgment', stanza xcii. Lines 97-102 were inserted in the Fifth Edition.]

[Footnote 15: The first edition of the Satire opened with this line; and Byron's original intention was to prefix the following argument, first published in 'Recollections', by R. C. Dallas (1824):—

""ARGUMENT.

""The poet considereth times past, and their poesy—makes a sudden transition to times present—is incensed against book-makers—revileth Walter Scott for cupidity and ballad-mongering, with notable remarks on Master Southey—complaineth that Master Southey had inflicted three poems, epic and otherwise, on the public—inveigheth against William Wordsworth, but laudeth Mister Coleridge and his elegy on a young ass—is disposed to vituperate Mr. Lewis—and greatly rebuketh Thomas Little (the late) and Lord Strangford—recommendeth Mr. Hayley to turn his attention to prose—and exhorteth the Moravians to glorify Mr. Grahame—sympathiseth with the Rev. [William Bowles]—and deploreth the melancholy fate of James Montgomery—breaketh out into invective against the Edinburgh Reviewers—calleth them hard names, harpies and the like—apostrophiseth Jeffrey, and prophesieth.—Episode of Jeffrey and Moore, their jeopardy and deliverance; portents on the morn of the combat; the Tweed, Tolbooth, Firth of Forth [and Arthur's Seat], severally shocked; descent of a goddess to save Jeffrey; incorporation of the bullets with his sinciput and occiput.—Edinburgh Reviews 'en masse'.—Lord Aberdeen, Herbert, Scott, Hallam, Pillans, Lambe, Sydney Smith, Brougham, etc.—Lord Holland applauded for dinners and translations.—The Drama; Skeffington, Hook, Reynolds, Kenney, Cherry, etc.—Sheridan, Colman, and Cumberland called upon [requested, MS.] to write.—Return to poesy—scribblers of all sorts—lords sometimes rhyme; much better not—Hafiz, Rosa Matilda, and X.Y.Z.—Rogers, Campbell, Gifford, etc. true poets—Translators of the Greek Anthology—Crabbe—Darwin's style—Cambridge—Seatonian Prize—Smythe—Hodgson—Oxford—Richards—Poetaloquitur—Conclusion.""]

[Footnote 16: Lines 115, 116, were a MS. addition to the printed text of 'British Bards'. An alternative version has been pencilled on the margin:—

""Otway and Congreve mimic scenes had wove
And Waller tuned his Lyre to mighty Love.""]
[Footnote 17: Thomas Little was the name under which Moore's early poems were published, 'The Poetical Works of the late Thomas Little, Esq.' (1801). ""Twelves"" refers to the ""duodecimo."" Sheets, after printing, are pressed between cold or hot rollers, to impart smoothness of ""surface."" Hot rolling is the more expensive process.]

[Footnote 18: Eccles. chapter i. verse 9.]

[Footnote 19: At first sight Byron appears to refer to the lighting of streets by gas, especially as the first shop lighted with it was that of Lardner & Co., at the corner of the Albany (June, 1805), and as lamps were on view at the premises of the Gas Light and Coke Company in Pall Mall from 1808 onwards. But it is almost certain that he alludes to the ""sublimating gas"" of Dr. Beddoes, which his assistant, Davy, mentions in his 'Researches' (1800) as nitrous oxide, and which was used by Southey and Coleridge. The same four ""wonders"" of medical science are depicted in Gillray's caricatures, November, 1801, and May and June, 1802, and are satirized in Christopher Caustic's 'Terrible Tractoration! A Poetical Petition against Galvanising Trumpery and the Perkinistit Institution' (in 4 cantos, 1803).

Against vaccination, or cow-pox, a brisk war was still being carried on.
Gillray has a likeness of Jenner vaccinating patients.
Metallic ""Tractors"" were a remedy much advertised at the beginning of the century by an American quack, Benjamin Charles Perkins, founder of the Perkinean Institution in London, as a ""cure for all Disorders, Red Noses, Gouty Toes, Windy Bowels, Broken Legs, Hump Backs.""

In Galvanism several experiments, conducted by Professor Aldini, nephew of Galvani, are described in the 'Morning Post' for Jan. 6th, Feb. 6th, and Jan. 22nd, 1803. The latter were made on the body of Forster the murderer.

For the allusion to Gas, compare 'Terrible Tractoration', canto 1—

""Beddoes (bless the good doctor) has
Sent me a bag full of his gas,
Which snuff'd the nose up, makes wit brighter,
And eke a dunce an airy writer.""]
[Footnote 20: Stott, better known in the 'Morning Post' by the name of
Hafiz. This personage is at present the most profound explorer of the
bathos. I remember, when the reigning family left Portugal, a special
Ode of Master Stott's, beginning thus:—('Stott loquitur quoad
Hibernia')—
""Princely offspring of Braganza,
Erin greets thee with a stanza,"" etc.
Also a Sonnet to Rats, well worthy of the subject, and a most thundering
Ode, commencing as follows:—
""Oh! for a Lay! loud as the surge
That lashes Lapland's sounding shore.""
Lord have mercy on us! the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel"" was nothing to this. [The lines ""Princely Offspring,"" headed ""Extemporaneous Verse on the expulsion of the Prince Regent from Portugal by Gallic Tyranny,"" were published in the 'Morning Post', Dec. 30, 1807. (See 'post', l. 708, and 'note'.)] ]

[Footnote 21: See p. 317, note 1.]

[Footnote 22: See the ""Lay of the Last Minstrel,"" 'passim'. Never was any plan so incongruous and absurd as the groundwork of this production. The entrance of Thunder and Lightning prologuising to Bayes' tragedy [('vide The Rehearsal'), 'British Bards'], unfortunately takes away the merit of originality from the dialogue between Messieurs the Spirits of Flood and Fell in the first canto. Then we have the amiable William of Deloraine, ""a stark moss-trooper,"" videlicet, a happy compound of poacher, sheep-stealer, and highwayman. The propriety of his magical lady's injunction not to read can only be equalled by his candid acknowledgment of his independence of the trammels of spelling, although, to use his own elegant phrase, ""'twas his neckverse at Harribee,"" 'i. e.' the gallows.

The biography of Gilpin Horner, and the marvellous pedestrian page, who travelled twice as fast as his master's horse, without the aid of seven-leagued boots, are 'chefs d'oeuvre' in the improvement of taste. For incident we have the invisible, but by no means sparing box on the ear bestowed on the page, and the entrance of a Knight and Charger into the castle, under the very natural disguise of a wain of hay. Marmion, the hero of the latter romance, is exactly what William of Deloraine would have been, had he been able to read and write. The poem was manufactured for Messrs. CONSTABLE, MURRAY, and MILLER, worshipful Booksellers, in consideration of the receipt of a sum of money; and truly, considering the inspiration, it is a very creditable production. If Mr. SCOTT will write for hire, let him do his best for his paymasters, but not disgrace his genius, which is undoubtedly great, by a repetition of Black-Letter Ballad imitations.

[Constable paid Scott a thousand pounds for 'Marmion', and

""offered one fourth of the copyright to Mr. Miller of Albemarle
Street, and one fourth to Mr. Murray of Fleet Street (see line 173).
Both publishers eagerly accepted the proposal.""
…
""A severe and unjust review of 'Marmion' by Jeffrey appeared in [the
'Edinburgh Review' for April] 1808, accusing Scott of a mercenary
spirit in writing for money. … Scott was much nettled by these
observations.""
('Memoirs of John Murray', i. 76, 95). In his diary of 1813 Byron wrote of Scott,

""He is undoubtedly the Monarch of Parnassus, and the most 'English' of
Bards.""
'Life', p. 206.]]

[Footnote 23: It was the suggestion of the Countess of Dalkeith, that
Scott should write a ballad on the old border legend of 'Gilpin Horner',
which first gave shape to the poet's ideas, and led to the 'Lay of the
Last Minstrel'.]
[Footnote 24: In his strictures on Scott and Southey, Byron takes his lead from Lady Anne Hamilton's (1766-1846, daughter of Archibald, ninth Duke of Hamilton, and Lady-in-waiting to Caroline of Brunswick) 'Epics of the Ton' (1807), a work which has not shared the dubious celebrity of her 'Secret Memories of the Court', etc. (1832). Compare the following lines (p. 9):—

""Then still might Southey sing his crazy Joan,
Or feign a Welshman o'er the Atlantic flown,
Or tell of Thalaba the wondrous matter,
Or with clown Wordsworth, chatter, chatter, chatter.
* * * * *
Good-natured Scott rehearse, in well-paid lays,
The marv'lous chiefs and elves of other days.""
(For Scott's reference to ""my share of flagellation among my betters,"" and an explicit statement that he had remonstrated with Jeffrey against the ""offensive criticism"" of 'Hours of Idleness', because he thought it treated with undue severity, see Introduction to 'Marmion', 1830.)]]

[Footnote 25: Lines 179, 180, in the Fifth Edition, were substituted for variant i. p. 312.—'Leigh Hunt's annotated Copy of the Fourth Edition'.]

[Footnote 26: ""Good night to Marmion""—the pathetic and also prophetic exclamation of Henry Blount, Esquire, on the death of honest Marmion.]

[Footnote 27: As the 'Odyssey' is so closely connected with the story of the 'Iliad', they may almost be classed as one grand historical poem. In alluding to Milton and Tasso, we consider the 'Paradise Lost' and 'Gerusalemme Liberata' as their standard efforts; since neither the 'Jerusalem Conquered' of the Italian, nor the 'Paradise Regained' of the English bard, obtained a proportionate celebrity to their former poems. Query: Which of Mr. Southey's will survive?]

[Footnote 28: 'Thalaba', Mr. Southey's second poem, is written in defiance of precedent and poetry. Mr. S. wished to produce something novel, and succeeded to a miracle. 'Joan of Arc' was marvellous enough, but 'Thalaba' was one of those poems ""which,"" in the word of PORSON, ""will be read when Homer and Virgil are forgotten, but—.]]",Lord Byron,1996,"[97, 96, 98, 97, 91, 89, 76, 81, 75, 75, 82, 85, 96, 92, 76, 86, 93]",17

couldn’t get the downstairs door open. I’m Sorry to wake you.
Holly Golightly: That’s quite all right. It could happen to anyone. Quite
frequently does. Good night.
Paul Varjak: I—I hate to, uh...I hate to bother you, but if I could ask one more
favor...could I use the phone?
Holly Golightly: Sure. Why not?
Paul Varjak: Hank you. Well, this is a...nice little place you’ve got here. You
just moved in, too, huh?
Holly Golightly: No. I’ve been here about a year. The phone’s over there. Well, it was. Oh, I remember. I stuck it in the suitcase. Kind of muffles the sound.
Paul Varjak: I’m...sorry. Is he all right?
Holly Golightly: Sure. Sure, he’s o.k. aren’t you, cat? Poor old cat. Poor slob. Poor slob without a name. The way I look at it I don’t have the right to give him one. We don’t belong to each other. We just took up by the river one day.
I don’t even want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I’m not sure where that is, but I know what it’s like. It’s like Tiffany’s.
Paul Varjak: Tiffany’s? You mean the jewelry store?
Holly Golightly: That’s right. I’m crazy about Tiffany’s. Listen. You know those days when you get the mean reds?
Paul Varjak: The mean reds? You mean, like the blues?
Holly Golightly: No the blues are because you’re getting fat or maybe it’s been raining too long. You’re just sad, that’s all. The mean reds are horrible.
Suddenly you’re afraid, and you don’t know what you’re afraid of. Don’t you
ever get that feeling?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: When I get it, the only thing that does any good is to jump
into a cab and go to Tiffany’s. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look. Nothing very bad could happen to you there. If I could find a real-life place that made me feel like Tiffany’s, then...then I’d buy some furniture and give the cat a name. I'm sorry. You wanted something. Oh, the
telephone.
Paul Varjak: It’s just that I’m supposed to meet somebody. I mean this is 10:00 Thursday morning, isn’t it? I just got off a plane from Rome, and I'm not too sure.

Paul Varjak: I think so.
Holly Golightly: Thursday! Oh, no! It can’t be! It’s too gruesome!
Paul Varjak: Well, uh...what’s so gruesome about Thursday?
Holly Golightly: Nothing, except I never remember when it’s coming up, Wednesdays I generally just don’t go to bed at all because I have to be up to catch the 10:45. And they’re so particular about visiting hours. Would you be a
darling and look under the bed and see if you can find a pair of alligator shoes.
Paul Varjak: Sure
Holly Golightly: I’ve got to do something about the way I look. I mean a girl just can’t go to Sing Sing with a green face.
Paul Varjak: Sing Sing?
Holly Golightly: I always thought it was a ridiculous name for a prison. Sing Sing, I mean. It sounds more like it should be an opera house or something.
Black, alligator. You know all the visitors make an effort to look their best. It’s only fair. Actually, it’s very touching, all the women wearing their prettiest things. I just love them for it, and I love the kids. I mean the kids the wives bring. It should be sad seeing kids there, but it isn’t. They all have ribbons in
their hair and lots of shine on their shoes. You’d think there was going to be ice cream.
Paul Varjak: Now as I understand it, what we’re doing is we’re getting you ready to visit somebody at Sing Sing.
Holly Golightly: That’s right! You could always tell what kind of a person a man thinks you are by the earrings he gives you. I must say, the mind reels.
Paul Varjak: May I ask whom?
Holly Golightly: Whom what? Oh, whom I’m going to visit?
Paul Varjak: I guess that’s what I mean.
Holly Golightly: I don’t know that I should even discuss it. But, well, he never
told me not to tell anyone. Cross your heart and kiss your elbow.
Paul Varjak: I’ll try.
Holly Golightly: You probably read about him. His name is Sally Tomato.
Paul Varjak: Sally Tomato?
Holly Golightly: Oh, don’t look so shocked. They couldn’t prove he was even part of the mafia, much less head of it. My dear, the only thing that they did was prove that he cheated at his income tax. Anyway, all I know is that he’s a darling old man. He was never my lover or anything like that. In fact, I never
knew him until after he was in prison. But I adore him now. I mean. I’ve gone to see him every Thursday for seven months. Now I think I’d go even if he didn’t pay me. Shoes.
Paul Varjak: I could only find one. He pays you?
Holly Golightly: That’s right, or anyway his lawyer does, if he is a lawyer, which I doubt, since he doesn’t have an office, only an answering service, and he always wants to meet at Hamburger Heaven. There you are, you sneak.
Thank you.
Paul Varjak: You’re welcome.
Holly Golightly: Dress. Dress. Here we are. Bag, and a hat, too. There we are. Anyway, about seven months ago, this so-called lawyer, Mr. O’Shaughnessy, asked me how I’d like to cheer up a lonely old man and pick up a hundred a week at the same time. I told him, “look, darling, you’ve got the wrong Holly Golightly.” A girl can do as well as that on trips to the powder
room. I mean any gentleman with the slightest sheik will give a girl $50 bill for the powder room. And I always ask for cab fare too —that’s another 50. But then he told me his client was Sally Tomato. He said “Dear old Sally had seen me at Elmo’s or somewhere and had admired me a la distance. So wouldn’t it
be a good deed to visit him once a week? But, how could I say no? It was all so wildly romantic. How do I look?
Paul Varjak: Very good. I must say I’m amazed.
Holly Golightly: You were a darling to help. I could never have done it without you. Bag.
Paul Varjak: Call me anytime. I’m just upstairs, or I will be as soon as I get moved in.
Holly Golightly: Bye, cat.
Paul: Uh...
Paul Varjak: Uh, you mean he gives you $100 for an hour’s conversation?
Holly Golightly: Oh, Mr. O’Shaughnessy does as soon as I meet him and give him the weather report.
Paul Varjak: Look it’s none of my business, but it sounds to me like you could get in trouble.
Holly Golightly: Hold this for me, will you?
Paul Varjak: And what do you mean, weather report?
Holly Golightly: Oh there’s just a message I give Mr. O’Shaughnessy so he knows I’ve really been up there. Sally tells me things to say like, uh... oh, there’s a hurricane in Cuba, and cloudy over Palermo, things like that. You
don’t have to worry. I’ve taken care of myself a long time.
Paul Varjak: Taxi! I never could do that.
Holly Golightly: It’s easy.
2E: Paul. I’m late. I know it. Don’t tell me you were locked out? Didn’t you get the key? Oh, darling. I’m so sorry.
Paul Varjak: No, I got the key, all right. Miss Golightly, my neighbor, was kind
enough to let me in. Miss Golightly’s on her way to Sing Sing. Just visiting, of
course. Miss Golightly, Mrs. Falenson, my...decorator.
Holly Golightly: How do you do?
2E: How do you do? Ooh, darling. Let me look at you.
Holly Golightly: Are—are you through?
2E: Was the flight absolutely ghastly?
(at the same time) Holly Golightly: I’m in a terrible rush.
Holly Golightly: Grand central station, and step on it darling.
2E: Is it really only three weeks since I left you in Rome? Seems like years.
You seen the apartment?
Paul Varjak: Not yet.
2E: Hmmm I know it was wicked of me, but I couldn’t resist. I went ahead and
fixed it up without you. I think its darling of course, but if you absolutely hate it,
we can rip everything out and start from scratch.
Mr. Yunioshi: Uhh! Miss Gorightly!
Man: Hey, baby! Where you going? Aww. Come on, baby. Open the door.
Aw, be a pal. You’re breaking up a beautiful party. Come on, baby. Open the
door. Hey, the band’s swinging. Aw, come on, baby.
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Gorightly! Once again, I must protest! If you don’t stop
that phonograph right this minute, I’m going to call the police department.
Yeah. That more better.
Man: What’s the matter, baby? Aw, come on. You’re a great kid. Open the
door. Come on, baby. I’m waiting for you.
Holly Golightly: It’s all right. It’s only me.
Paul Varjak: Uh, wait a minute. Miss, uh...
Holly Golightly: Golightly. Holly Golightly. I live downstairs. We met this
morning. Remember?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: It’s all right. She’s gone. I must say she works late hours for
a decorator. The thing is, I have the most terrifying man downstairs. I mean
he’s sweet when he isn’t drunk, but let him start lapping up the vino, and, oh,
golly, quel beast. It finally got so tiresome down there, I went out the window.
Look you can throw me out if you want to, but you did looked so cozy in here,
and your decorator friend had gone home, and it was getting cold out thereon
the fire escape.
Paul Varjak: And I always heard people in New York never get to know their
neighbors. Well... how was Sing Sing?
Holly Golightly: Fine. I made the train and everything.
Paul Varjak: And what’s the weather report?
Holly Golightly: Small-craft warnings, block island to Hatteras—whatever
that means. You know, you’re sweet. You really are. And you look a little like
my brother Fred. Do you mind if I call you Fred?
Paul Varjak: Not at all.
Holly Golightly: 300. She’s very generous. Is that by the week, the hour, or
what?
Paul Varjak: Okay. The party’s over. Out.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred. Darling Fred, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt your
feelings. Don’t be angry. I was just trying to let you know I understand. I
understand completely.
Paul Varjak: It’s okay. Stick around. Make yourself a drink. Throw me my
robe. I’ll make you one.
Holly Golightly: You stay right where you are. You must be absolutely
exhausted. I mean, it’s very late, and you were sound asleep and everything. I
suppose you think I’m very brazen or tres fou or something.
Paul Varjak: You’re no fouer than anybody else.
Holly Golightly: Yes, you do. Everybody does. And I don’t mind. It’s useful
being top banana in the shock department. What do you do, anyway?
Paul Varjak: I’m a writer, I guess.
Holly Golightly: You guess? Don’t you know?
Paul Varjak: Okay, positive statement. Ringing affirmative. I’m a writer.
Holly Golightly: The only writer I’ve ever been out with is Benny Shacklett.
He’s written an awful lot f television stuff, but quel rat. Tell me, are you a real
writer? I mean, does anybody buy what you write or publish it or anything?
Paul Varjak: They bought what’s in that box.
Holly Golightly: Yours?
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm.
Holly Golightly: All these books?
Paul Varjak: Well, there’s just the one book, 12 copies of it.
Holly Golightly: “nine lives, by Paul Varjak.” they’re stories.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm. Nine of them.
Holly Golightly: Tell me one.
Paul Varjak: They’re not the kind of stories you can really tell.
Holly Golightly: Too dirty?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, I...suppose they’re dirty, too, but only incidentally. Mainly
they’re angry, sensitive... intensely felt, and that dirtiest of all dirty words—
promising. Or so said the times book review, October 1, 1956.
Holly Golightly: 1956?
Paul Varjak: That’s right.
Holly Golightly: I suppose this is kind of a ratty question, but what have you
written lately?
Paul Varjak: Lately, I’ve been working on a novel.
Holly Golightly: Lately, since 1956?
Paul Varjak: Well, a novel takes a long time. I want it exactly right.
Holly Golightly: So, no more stories.
Paul Varjak: Well, the idea is I’m supposed to not fritter my talent on little
things. I’m supposed to be saving it for the big one.
Holly Golightly: Tell me. Do you write every day?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Today?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: It’s a beautiful typewriter.
Paul Varjak: Of course. It writes nothing but sensitive, intensely felt,
promising prose.
Holly Golightly: But there’s no ribbon in it.
Paul Varjak: There isn’t?
Holly Golightly: No.
Paul Varjak: Oh. You know something you said this morning has been
bothering me all day.
Holly Golightly: What’s that?
Paul Varjak: Do they really give you $50 whenever you go to the powder
room?
Holly Golightly: Of course.
Paul Varjak: You must do very well.
Holly Golightly: I’m trying to save, but I’m not very good at it. You know, you
do look a lot like my brother Fred. I haven’t seen him of course since I was 14.
That’s when I left home. And he was already 6’2”. I guess it must have been
the peanut butter that did it. Everybody thought he was dotty the way he
gorged himself on peanut butter, but he wasn’t dotty, just sweet and vague
and...Terribly slow. Poor Fred. He’s in the army now. That’s really the best
place for him until I can get enough money saved.
Paul Varjak: And then?
Holly Golightly: And then Fred and I... I went to Mexico once. It’s a wonderful
place for raising horses. I saw one place near the sea that... Fred’s very good
with horses. Even land in Mexico costs something. And no matter what I do,
there’s never seems to be more than a couple hundred dollars in the bank. It
can’t be 4:30. It just can’t. Do you mind if I just get in with you for a minute?
It’s all right. Really, it is. We’re friends. That’s all. We are friends, aren’t we?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Okay., let’s don’t say another word. Let’s just go to sleep.
Where are you, Fred? It’s cold. There—there’s snow in the wind.
Paul Varjak: What is it? What’s the matter? Why are you crying?
Holly Golightly: If we’re going to be friends, let’s just get one thing straight
right now. I hate snoops.
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
2E: Lucille, darling? 2E.
Paul Varjak: Huh?
2E: I’ve been trying desperately to reach you. Bill just got back—a day early,
the beast—so I’m afraid I’ll have to beg off. You’ll explain to the rest of the
girls? You’re a darling. Maybe we can have a long lunch tomorrow. I’ll phone
you in the morning.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm. Whatever you say.
2E: You will manage to survive without me tonight?
Paul Varjak: Sure. I might even take a wild boyish fling at writing.
2E: Good night.
Paul Varjak: Good night.
O.J. Berman: Got yourself stuffed, huh, Polly, baby? Serves you right,
bigmouth.
O.J. Berman: Buon giorno.
Irving: Huh?
O.J. Berman: Aren’t you drinking?
Irving: Mm-hmm.
O.J. Berman: You have pockets there or something? What do you go by?
Irving: Hmm?
O.J. Berman: What’s your name? What’s your name? What do you call
yourself?
Irving: Irving.
O.J. Berman: Ohh, yean. Perfect, perfect. That’s wonderful. Perfect. I’ll be
right back, Irving, baby.
Irving: Mm-hmm.
O.J. Berman: Yeah? Whoa whoa. Kid’s still in the shower. You expected?
Paul Varjak: I was invited. That what you mean?
O.J. Berman: Don’t get all tense and soft. Come on in. it’s a party. There’s a
lot of characters coming around here who aren’t expected. I’ll buy you a
drink. You drink?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
O.J. Berman: Then I’ll buy you a drink.
Paul Varjak: Okay.
O.J. Berman: Hey, honey, your skirt’s split there. What do you drink kid?
Paul Varjak: Bourbon.
O.J. Berman: Bourbon. On the rocks?
Paul Varjak: Yeah—no. with water.
O.J. Berman: You want rocks first?
Paul Varjak: Uh, yeah. Not too much.
O.J. Berman: All right. That’ll set you free. Know the kid long?
Paul Varjak: Not very. I live upstairs.
O.J. Berman: You’re kidding! Look at this place. What a place. It’s
unbelievable. What a dump. What do you think?
Paul Varjak: About what?
O.J. Berman: Is she or isn’t she? Wait a minute. Hold it. Harriet!
Guest: Hi, J.B.
O.J. Berman: “J.B.”? Oh! What’s that?
Guest: You know Gil?
O.J. Berman: Yeah. How are you?
Gil: How about a drink?
O.J. Berman: In the kitchen. You’ll find everything you need.
Gil: Thanks.
O.J. Berman: Yeah. So—oh, honey, that is you. That is you.
Holly Golightly: Fred, darling, I’m so glad you could come.
Paul Varjak: I brought you a house present. Something for the bookcase.
Holly Golightly: Oh, you’re sweet. Doesn’t that look nice? Give me a
cigarette,
O.J. Berman: Sure, sure.
Holly Golightly: O.J. he’s a great agent. He knows a lot of phone numbers.
What’s Jerry Weld’s phone number O.J.?
O.J. Berman: Come on, lay off.
Holly Golightly: I want you to call him and tell him Fred’s a genius. Stop
blushing, Fred. You didn’t say you’re a genius, I did. So Quit stalling O.J.. Just
tell him what you’re going to do to make Fred rich and famous?
O.J. Berman: Now why don’t you let Fred baby and me settle that, huh,
puppy?
Holly Golightly: Okay. But just remember, I’m the agent. He’s already got a
decorator. I’m the agent.
O.J. Berman: Hold it. Hi, boys. Come on in there. Right in the kitchen
everything you need. So listen, Fred, baby, What are—
Paul Varjak: No, its Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Oh! It is? I thought it was Fred, baby.
Paul Varjak: No
O.J. Berman: Well Answer the question. Is she or isn’t she?
Paul Varjak: Is she or isn’t she what?
O.J. Berman: A phony.
Paul Varjak: I don’t know. I don’t think so.
O.J. Berman: So, you don’t, huh? Well, you’re wrong. She is. Uh, on the
other hand, you’re right, because she’s a real phony. You know why?
Because she honestly believes all this phony junk that she believes in. I
mean it. Now look, I like the kid, I sincerely like the kid. I do. I’m sensitive,
that’s why. You got to be sensitive to like the kid. It’s .. It’s what you call a
touch, a streak of the poet.
Paul Varjak: You known her long?
O.J. Berman: Are you kidding? I’m the guy that discovered her. I’m O.J.
Berman. A couple of years ago, back in the coast, she was just a kid—lot of
style and class...you know
Paul Varjak: Lot of what?
O.J. Berman: Class. She had a lot of class. But when she opened her mouth,
you didn’t know what she was talking about—whether she was a hillbilly or an
Okie. You know how long it took me to smooth that accent?
Paul Varjak: No.
O.J. Berman: I’ll tell you how long. One year. Know how we did it? Ah We
gave her French lessons. Figured once she could imitate French, she‘d have
no trouble imitating English. And, ah, finally, when I thought she was ready I
arranged for a little screen test. The night before the screen test, oh I could
have killed myself. The night before, the phone rings. I picked it up. I said,
“O.J. speaking.” she says, “this is Holly.” I says Holly?, You sound so far away
honey. What’s with you?.” she says, “I’m in New York.” I said, “What kind of
New York? You gotta screen test tomorrow.” She says,” I’m in New York
because I’ve never been to New York before.” I says “Get yourself on the
plane, get back here.” ”She says, “I don’t want to.” “What do you mean you
don’t want to? What do you want?” she says, “I don’t want to.” I says, ”What
do you want?” She says, “when I find out what I want, I’m going to let you
know.” so, look, Fred, baby— you know. Don’t tell me --.
Paul Varjak: It’s Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Paul baby, sure . Don’t tell me she isn’t a phony. You know
what I mean?. Irving. Honey, Irving, where you been?
Holly Golightly: Mmm, thanks. Mike, darling, I tried reaching you all day long.
Your answering service doesn’t answer.
Guest: Well you know the kind of trouble people have with answering
services.
Holly Golightly: Well, I guess so. Say I saw your mother down at the Roxie
the other day.
Guest: And after all that she said about him, and he knows ….
Paul Varjak: Holly!
Female Guest: Time, darling.
Holly Golightly: What?
Female Guest: Time?
Holly Golightly: You have a watch?
Male Guest: No.
Holly Golightly: Oh, let me see. 6:45.
Female Guest: Thank you.
Female Guest: Aaahh! Really, was that necessary?
Paul Varjak: This is some party. Who are all these people, anyhow?
Holly Golightly: Who knows? The word gets out. You don’t mind, do you,
darling? Mmmm. Reinforcements.
Guests: Right in there.
Mag Wildwood: Holly? Holly, d-darling!
Paul Varjak: What’s that?
Holly Golightly: Mag Wildwood. She’s a model, believe it or not, and a
thumping bore. But just look at the goodies she brought with her.
Paul Varjak: He’s all right I suppose, if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking
men with passionate natures and too many teeth.
Holly Golightly: I don’t mean that one, I mean the other one.
Paul Varjak: The other one?
Holly Golightly: He’s Rusty Trawler.
Paul Varjak: Huh?
Holly Golightly: Rusty Trawler. He happens to be the ninth richest man in
America under 50.
Paul Varjak: Now, that, indeed, is a remarkable piece of information to have
at your fingertips.
Holly Golightly: I keep track of these things.
Delivery Boy: Excuse me. You owe me 47--
Holly Golightly: Hold this a minute for me will you darling.
Holly Golightly: Mag, darling, what are you doing here?
Mag Wildwood: Holly! I was upstairs working with Yunioshi—Easter stuff for
the b-bazaar. Then these two nice boys came to pick me up. It was a mistake,
of course. My wires got crossed somewhere. They were both very sweet
about it. May I present Jose Silva Pereira? He’s from Brazil. Miss G-Golightly.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Very kind of you, miss Golightly, to allow me to attend
your party. I’m so interested in North American culture. I’ve been already of
course to the statue of liberty and to the restaurant automatique. But this is
the first time I am in a typical North American home.
Mag Wildwood: Wouldn’t he just m-melt in your mouth? And this is Mr. Rusty
Trawler. Miss Golightly. You’re not vexed at me for bringing him?
Holly Golightly: Of course not, darling.
Mag Wildwood: Darling. I’m glad. Now, who’s going to bring me a bourbon?
Holly Golightly: O.J.
O.J. Berman: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?
O.J. Berman: Yeah. Which one’s Miss Wildwood?
Mag Wildwood: Mr. Berman, we haven’t been formally introduced. But I’m
Mag Wildwood from Wildwood, Arkansas. That’s...hill country.
Holly Golightly: Now, you just make yourself right at home, senor
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, don’t trouble yourself. I’m contented to stand
observing the customs of your country.
Holly Golightly: Okay, you do that. Now come along, Mr. Trawler. Let’s see
what we can find to amuse you with.
Husband: I wasn’t supposed to pick you up.
Wife: You said you would pick me up, and at the last minute I had …
Husband: Look I wasn’t supposed to pick you up, here or anywhere.
Paul Varjak: Yeah?
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Golightly? This time I’m a-warning you! I am definitely this
time going to calling the police!
Female Guest: Wow!
Male Guest: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Is it something important?
Paul Varjak: Nah. just the guy upstairs complaining about the noise.
Jose da Silva Pereira: He’s angry.
Paul Varjak: Well, He did mention something about calling the police.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, the police. The police? Oh! That I cannot have. I’d
better look for Miss Wildwood and go.
Female Guest: To think I’d find a beau of mine mousing after a piece of
cheap Hollywood trash.
Holly Golightly: Mag, darling, you’re being a bore.
Mag Wildwood: Shut up, you! You know what’s going to happen to you? I’m
going to march you over to the zoo and feed you to the yak... just as soon as I
finish this drink.
Holly Golightly: Timber!
Aaahh!
Sorry. Oh.
O.J. Berman: Oh, good evening, Ed.
Paul Varjak: It’s Paul, baby.
O.J. Berman: Oh, yes. You remember Irving, don’t you?
Paul Varjak: This is Jose.
O.J. Berman: Nice to meet you.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Wonderful seeing you.
O.J. Berman: Yes -- Jewel thieves.
Holly Golightly: Sally helps me with my accounts. I have no head for figures
at all. I’m trying desperately to save some money, you know I told you. I just
can’t seem to. He makes me write down everything in there. What I get, what I
spend. I used to have a checking account. He made me get rid of that. He
feels, for me anyway, that it’s better to operate on a cash basis, tax wise.
Sally Tomato: Someday, Mr. Fred, you take this book, turn into a novel.
Everything is there. Just fill in a little of the details.
Holly Golightly: Certainly would be good for some laughs.
Sally Tomato: No. no, I don’t think so. This is a book would break the heart.
“Mr. Fitzsimons—powder room, $50. “Less $18--repair one black satin dress.
Cat food, 27 cents.”
Holly Golightly: Sally, darling, please stop. You’re making me blush. But
you’re right about jack Fitzsimons. He’s an absolute rat. But I guess, of
course, I really don’t know anybody but rats. Except, of course, Fred here.
You do think Fred is nice, don’t you Sally?
Sally Tomato: For you... I hope he is.
Convict: Give me a kiss goodbye.
Holly Golightly: Goodbye, Uncle Sally. Till next week.
Paul Varjak: Goodbye, Uncle Sally.
Sally Tomato: Goodbye and don’t forget to send that book. Heh?!
Paul Varjak: I won’t.
Holly Golightly: Oh, what about the weather report?
Sally Tomato: Oh, yes. Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans.
Holly Golightly: Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans? Isn’t
that the weirdest? I bet they haven’t had snow in New Orleans for a million
years. I don’t know how he thinks them up.
Holly Golightly: Moon river wider than a mile I’m crossin’’ you in style
someday oh, dream maker you heartbreaker wherever you’re goin’ I’m goin’
your way two drifters off to see the world there’s such a lot of world to see
we’re after the same rainbow’s end waitin’ ‘round the bend my huckleberry
friend moon river and me.
Hi.
Paul Varjak: Hi.
Holly Golightly: What you doin’?
Paul Varjak: Writing.
Holly Golightly: Good.
Paul Varjak: Well, hello. What’s wrong?
2E: I don’t know. It’s probably nothing. I want to see if he’s still there.
Paul Varjak: See if who’s still there? What are you talking about?
2E: Look. See? I noticed him yesterday afternoon. I didn’t say anything. I
didn’t want to sound neurotic, but... when he’s there again today...
Paul Varjak: Who do you think he is?
2E: It could be anybody, of course, but what crossed my mind was... suppose
Bill’s having us watched, huh?
Paul Varjak: I’ll take care of this.
2E: No. no, don’t. Please. If that’s what it is, you’ll only make everything
worse.
Paul Varjak: I’ll be careful. You wait here.
2E: Darling, please don’t. I don’t think you should.
Paul Varjak: Now, take it easy. I just want to find out what this is all about.
Paul Varjak: All right, what do you want?
Doc Golightly: Son, I need a friend. That’s me, that’s her, that’s her brother
Fred.
Paul Varjak: You’re Holly’s father?
Doc Golightly: Her name ain’t holly. She was Lula Mae Barnes. Was till she
married me. I’m her husband Doc Golightly.
Paul Varjak: Paul Varjak.
Doc Golightly: I’m a horse Doctor. Animal man. Do some farming, too, near
tulip, Texas. Her brother Fred’s getting out of the army soon. Lula Mae
belongs home with her husband, her brother, and her children.
Paul Varjak: Children?
Doc Golightly: Them’s her children.
Paul Varjak: She’s got four children?
Doc Golightly: Now, son, I didn’t claim they was her natural-born children.
Their own precious mother—precious woman—passed away July 4th,
independence day, 1955, the year of the drought. When I married Lula Mae,
she was going on 14. Now you might think the average person going on 14
wouldn’t know his own mind. But you take Lula Mae, she was an exceptional
person. I’ll tell you son she just plumb broke our hearts when she run off like
she done. Just plain had no reason. All the housework was done by our
daughters. Lula Mae could just take it easy. I tell you that woman got
positively fat, while her brother, he growed up into a giant, which is a sight
different from the way they come to us. A couple of wild young’uns they was. I
caught ‘em outside the house stealing milk and turkey eggs. Lula Mae and her
brother had been living with some mean, no-account people about 100 mile
east of tulip. She had good cause to run off from that house. Never had none
to leave mine.
Paul Varjak: What about her brother? Didn’t he leave, too?
Doc Golightly: No sir. We had Fred with us till they took him in the army.
That’s why I come to talk to her about. I had a letter from him. He’s getting out
of the army in February. That’s why I got on a Greyhound bus to come and
get her. Lula Mae’s place is with her husband, her children, and her brother.
Huh?
Paul Varjak The prize from the cracker jack. Want it?
Doc Golightly: Uh-uh. Never could understand why that woman run off. Don’t
tell me she weren’t happy. Talky as a jaybird she was, with something smart
to say on every subject. Better than the radio. The night I proposed, I cried
like a baby. She said, “What do you want to cry for, Doc? Of course we’ll be
married. I never been married before.” Well I had laughed and hugged and
squeezed her. “Never been married before.” listen, son, I advise you, I need a
friend, ‘cause I don’t want to surprise her or scare her none. Be my friend. Let
her know I’m here. Will you do that for me, son?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, sure, Doc, if that’s what you want. Come on.
Holly Golightly: All right. Coming. Oh, darling, I’m just on my way out. I’m
supposed to be at 21 half an hour ago. Maybe we can have a drink or
something tomorrow.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Lula Mae... if you’re still here tomorrow.
Holly Golightly: Oh, please, where is he? Fred? Fred?
Doc Golightly: Gosh. Lula Mae. Gee, honey, don’t they feed you up here?
You’re so skinny.
Holly Golightly: Hi, Doc.
Doc Golightly: Gosh, Lula Mae... kingdom come.
Paul Varjak: What is it? What’s the matter? You all right?
Holly Golightly: I guess so. No, I’m not. Fred will you help me?
Paul Varjak: If I can.
Holly Golightly: I want you to come to the bus station with us, Doc and me.
He still thinks I’m going back with him. I don’t know if I can play the scene
alone.
Paul Varjak: Holly. What can I do? He’s your husband.
Holly Golightly: No, he’s not.
Paul Varjak: He’s not?
Holly Golightly: It was annulled ages ago. But he just won’t accept it. Please,
Fred, I’ll tell him you’re seeing us off. Don’t say anything. Just meet us out
front in about an hour. Please?
Doc Golightly: You wait right here, honey. I’ll get the bag.
Paul Varjak: Why don’t I get some Magazines?
Holly Golightly: Please, Fred, don’t leave me.
Train Attendant: Attention, please. Leaving from platform five, through coach
to Dallas—Philadelphia, Columbus, Indianapolis, Terre haute, St.. Louis,
Tulsa, Oklahoma city, Denison, Dallas.
Doc Golightly: Come on, Lula Mae. That’s us.
Holly Golightly: Doc, I’m not coming with you. Come on. Let’s walk together
quietly and I’ll try and help you understand. Help me talk to him, Fred.
Doc Golightly: That’s alright son. I appreciate you want to help, but it’s
between Lula Mae and me.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Doc.
Doc Golightly: I love you, Lula Mae.
Holly Golightly: I know you do, and that’s the trouble. It’s a mistake you
always made DOC—trying to love a wild thing. You were always lugging
home wild things—Once it was a hawk with a broken wing. Another time it
was a full-grown wildcat with a broken leg... remember?
Doc Golightly: Lula Mae there’s something—
Holly Golightly: You mustn’t give your heart to a wild thing. The more you do,
the stronger they get until they’re strong enough to run into the woods or fly
into a tree, then to higher trees, then to the sky.
Doc Golightly: Lula Mae there’s something I got to tell you.
Stranger: Excuse me.
Doc Golightly: A couple weeks ago, I got a letter from young Fred.
Holly Golightly: From Fred? He’s all right, isn’t he?
Doc Golightly: Yeah, he’s fine, I guess. He’s getting out of the army in
February. That’s what he wrote to tell me about.
Holly Golightly: In February? Well, that’s only four months.
Doc Golightly: So, see, you got to come back Lula Mae. Your place is with
me, your children and your brother.
Holly Golightly: Doc, you’ve got to understand. I can’t come back.
Doc Golightly: And you got to understand what I’m trying to tell you. I don’t
want to seem like I’m pressuring you, but it got to. If you don’t come back with
me, I’m going to have to write young Fred, tell him that unless he wants to
look out for himself, he better sign up for another hitch.
Holly Golightly: Doc don’t you do that. Don’t you write that to him. I’ll write
him myself and tell him I want him here with me. I’ll take care of him. Don’t
you worry.
Doc Golightly: You’re talking crazy, Lula Mae.
Holly Golightly: Doc, stop calling me that. I’m not Lula Mae anymore.
Doc Golightly: All right, Lula Mae. I guess you know what you’re doing.
Doc Golightly: Keep an eye on her, will you, son? At least see she eats
something once in a while.
Paul Varjak: Sure, Doc.
Doc Golightly: So skinny.
Holly Golightly: Please, Doc. please understand. I love you, but I’m just not
Lula Mae anymore. I’m not.
Holly Golightly: You know the terrible thing, Fred, darling? I am still Lula
Mae-- 14 years old, stealing turkey eggs, and running through a briar patch.
Except now I call it having the mean reds. Well, it’s still too early to go to
Tiffany’s. I guess the next best thing is a drink. Yes, I very much need a drink.
Will you buy me one, Fred, darling?
Paul Varjak: Sure.
Holly Golightly: Only promise me one thing—don’t take me home until I’m
drunk... until I’m very drunk, indeed.
Holly Golightly: Do you think she’s talented, deeply and importantly
talented?
Paul Varjak: Hmm. No. amusingly and superficially talented, yes, but deeply
and importantly, no.
Holly Golightly: Gracious. Do you think she’s handsomely paid?
Paul Varjak: Hmm? Oh. Indeed.
Holly Golightly: Well, let me tell you something mister. If I had her money, I’d
be richer than she is.
Paul Varjak: How do you figure that?
Holly Golightly: Because I’d keep the candy store. Old Sally Tomato—that’s
my candy store. I’d always keep Sally. And that’s why I’d be richer than she is.
Paul Varjak: Hmm. We’d better get a little more air.
Holly Golightly: Tom, Dick, and Harry—no. correction. Every tom, dick, and
Sid—Harry was his friend. Anyway, every tom, dick, and Sid sinks—thinks if
he takes a girl to dinner, she’ll just curl up like a kitten, in a little furry ball at
his feet, right? I have by actual count been taken to dinner by 26 different rats
in the last 2 months, 27, if you count Benny Shacklet, who’s in many ways a
super rat.
Paul Varjak: I think I forgot my key.
Holly Golightly: Never mind. I just buzzed Yunioshi.
Paul Varjak: Oh.
Holly Golightly: Do you want to know something funny? In spite of the fact
that most of these rats fork up $50 for the powder room like little dolls... Again
I find by actual account, I have $9.00 less in the old bank account than I had
six months ago. So, my darling Fred, I have tonight made a very serious
decision.
Paul Varjak: And what is that?
Holly Golightly: No longer will I play the field.
Paul Varjak: Congratulations.
Holly Golightly: The field stinks, both economically and socially, and I’m
giving it up.
Paul Varjak: Whoa.
Mr. Yunioshi: Miss Golightly, this time I’m not only calling the police, the fire
department, and New York state housing commission, and, if necessary, the
board of health!
Holly Golightly: Quiet, up there. You want to wake the whole house? as miss
Golightly was saying before she was so rudely interrupted, miss Golightly
further announces her intention to devote her not inconsiderable talents to the
immediate capture, for the purpose of matrimony, of Mr. Br-Rutherford—Rusty
to his friends, of whom I’m sure he has many—Trawler.
Paul Varjak: Who?
Holly Golightly: Rusty Trawler. You met him at my party. A couple of weeks
ago. He came with Mag Wildwood, not the beautiful Latin type. The other one,
the one that looks like a pig. Remember? The 9th richest man in America
under 50?
Ah... Do I detect a look of disapproval in your eye? Tough beans, buddy,
‘cause that’s the way it’s going to be. Hi, Cat.
Paul Varjak: Holly, you’re drunk.
Holly Golightly: True. Absolutely true. True, but irrelevant.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
Holly Golightly: So I think we should have a drink to the new Mrs. Rusty
Trawler... me.
Paul Varjak: Hey, take it easy.
Holly Golightly: What’s the matter? Don’t you think I can do it? Tell me.
Seriously I’m interested. Don’t you think I can? You heard the Doc. my brother
gets out of the army in February. The Doc won’t take him back. It’s all up to
me. I don’t know why you don’t understand. I need money, and I’ll do
whatever I have to do to get it. So... this time next month, I’ll be the new Mrs.
Rusty Trawler. And I think we should have a little drink to that. It’s all gone.
Isn’t that too bad? Got any whiskey upstairs?
Paul Varjak: But you’ve had enough.
Holly Golightly: Go ahead. Get the whiskey. I’ll pay you for it.
Paul Varjak: Holly, please.
Holly Golightly: No, no. you disapprove of me, and I do not accept drinks
from gentlemen who disapprove of me. I’ll pay for my own whiskey. And don’t
you forget it.
Paul Varjak: Holly.
Holly Golightly: I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentlemen,
especially not disapproving gentlemen who are kept by other ladies. So take
it. You should be used to taking money from ladies by now.
Paul Varjak: If I were you, I’d be more careful with my money. Rusty Trawler
is too hard a way of earning it.
Holly Golightly: It should take you exactly four seconds to cross from here to
that door. I’ll give you two.
Paul Varjak:: Heh.
Paul Varjak: Hi. I came up to talk to you about the other night, then I saw the
paper, and—well, actually, I’m kind of embarrassed about it, but since it
concerns you, I thought I ought to talk about it in person.
Holly Golightly: What?
Paul Varjak: What?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Oh. The earplugs. Well I can’t go through the whole thing again.
It’s sufficient to say, I’ve come to make up. As an added inducement, I have
all kinds of news. Can I come in?
Holly Golightly: I guess so. Just a minute. Do I have a nightgown on? No, I
don’t. Would you mind turning around for a second? On second thought never
mind. That’s such a corny line anyway. I’ll turn around myself. Come in.
Paul Varjak: Have... you seen the paper?
Holly Golightly: Mm. Rusty, you mean.
Paul Varjak: Mm-hmm.
Holly Golightly: Yes. I know all about it. Certainly had him... pegged wrong,
didn’t I? I thought he was just a rat, but he was a super rat all along. A super
rat in rat’s clothing. You don’t even know the best part. Not only was he a rat
or super rat. Rather he was also broke. Broke? I mean, but not a farthing. His
family has money, of course, but he personally is broke. It turns out he owes
$700,000. Can you imagine anyone owing $700,000? $43, yes. Anyway,
that’s why he decided to marry the queen of the pig people. I’ll tell you one thing, Fred, darling—I’d marry you for your money in a minute. Would you marry me for my money?
Paul Varjak: In a minute.
Holly Golightly: So I guess it’s pretty lucky neither of us is rich, huh?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred, darling, I’m so glad to see you. What have you
been doing?
Paul Varjak: Writing, mostly. Sold a story. Just got word this morning.
Holly Golightly: Oh, that’s marvelous. It really is. But only how does your decorator friend feel about it? I thought you were supposed to be saving yourself and all that.
Paul Varjak: You know something? I haven’t quite got around to telling heryet. Look, why don’t we go have a drink or take a walk to celebrate?
Holly Golightly: All right. I think there’s some champagne in the icebox. Why don’t you open it while I get dressed?
Paul Varjak: Okay I don’t think I’ve ever drunk champagne before breakfast before. With breakfast on several occasions, but never before before.
Holly Golightly: Well, I’ve got a wonderful idea. We can spend the whole day doing things we’ve never done before. We’ll take turns. First something you’ve never done, then me. ‘Course, I can’t really think of anything I’ve never done.
Whoa!
Holly Golightly: I’ve never been for a walk in the morning before. At least not
since I’ve been in New York. I’ve walked up 5th avenue at 6:00, but as far as
I’m concerned that still night. Do you think it counts?
Paul Varjak: Sure, it counts. Now we’re even.
Holly Golightly: Don’t you just love it?
Paul Varjak: Love what?
Holly Golightly: Tiffany’s.
Isn’t it wonderful? You see what I mean, how nothing bad could happen to you in a place like this? It isn’t that I give a hoot about jewelry, except
diamonds, of course.
Like that.
What do you think?
Paul Varjak: Well...
Holly Golightly: Of course personally, I think it would be tacky to wear diamonds before I’m 40.
Paul Varjak: Well, you’re right, but in the meantime, you should have something.
Holly Golightly: I’ll wait.
Paul Varjak: No. I’m going to buy you a present. You bought me a typewriter ribbon, and it brought me luck.
Holly Golightly: Alright, but Tiffany’s can be pretty expensive.
Paul Varjak: I’ve got my check and $10.
Holly Golightly: Oh, I wouldn’t let you cash your check, but a present for $10 or under, that I’ll accept. Of course, I don’t know exactly what we’re going to
find at Tiffany’s for $10.
Salesclerk: May I help you?
Paul Varjak: Perhaps. Actually we were looking for a present for the lady.
Salesclerk: Certainly, sir. Was there something special you had in mind?
Paul Varjak: Well, we had considered diamonds, and I don’t want to offend you, but the lady feels that diamonds are tacky for her.
Holly Golightly: Oh, I think they’re divine on older women, but I don’t think they’d be right for me, you do understand.
Salesclerk: Certainly.
Paul Varjak: In all fairness, I think I ought to explain there’s also a secondary
problem, one of finance. We can only afford to spend... a limited amount.
Salesclerk: May I ask how limited?
Holly Golightly: $10.
Salesclerk: $10.
Paul Varjak: That was the outside figure, yes.
Salesclerk: I see.
Holly Golightly: Do you have anything for $10?
Salesclerk: Frankly, madam, within that price range, the variety of
merchandise is rather limited. However, I do think we might have—let me
see... strictly as a novelty, you understand, for the lady and gentleman who
has everything, a sterling silver telephone dialer. That’s 6.75, including tax.
Paul Varjak: A sterling silver telephone dialer.
Salesclerk: Yes, sir. That’s 6.75, including federal tax.
Paul Varjak: Well, the price is right, but I must say, I’d rather hoped for
something slightly more—how shall I say it—romantic in feeling. What do you
think?
Holly Golightly: A sterling silver telephone dialer—I certainly think it’s
handsome, but, I mean-- , you do understand.
Paul Varjak: Well, we tried, but—we could have something engraved,
couldn’t we?
Salesclerk: Yes, I suppose so. Yes, indeed. The only problem is, you’d more
or less have to buy something first in order to have some object upon which to
place the engraving. You see the difficulty?
Paul Varjak: Well, we could have this engraved, couldn’t we? I think it would
be very smart.
Salesclerk: This, I take it, was not purchased at Tiffany’s?
Paul Varjak: No. actually, it was purchased concurrent with—well, actually, it
came inside a... well, a box of cracker jack.
Salesclerk: I see. Do they still really have prizes in cracker jack boxes?
Paul Varjak: Oh, yes.
Salesclerk: That’s nice to know. It gives one a feeling of solidarity, almost of
continuity with the past, that sort of thing.
Holly Golightly: You think Tiffany’s would really engrave it for us? I mean you
don’t think they’d feel it beneath them or anything like that?
Salesclerk: Well, it is rather unusual, madam, but I think you’ll find that
Tiffany’s is very understanding. If you would tell me what initials you would
like, I think we could have something ready for you in the morning.
Holly Golightly: Didn’t I tell you this was a lovely place?
Holly Golightly: What is this place anyway?
Paul Varjak: You said you wanted to sit down. It’s the public library. You’ve
never been here?
Holly Golightly: No. that makes two for me. I don’t see any books.
Paul Varjak: They’re in there. See?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Each one of these little drawers is stuffed with little cards. And
each little card is a book or an author.
Holly Golightly: I think that’s fascinating.
Paul Varjak: V-a-r-j-a-k.
Holly Golightly: Really? Look. Isn’t it marvelous? There you are, right in the
public library. “Varjak, Paul. Nine lives.” then a lot of numbers. Do you think
they really have the book itself, live?
Paul Varjak: Sure. Follow me.
Paul Varjak: Number 57. That’s us.
Holly Golightly: 57, please. Nine lives by Varjak, Paul.
Librarian: Shh.
Holly Golightly: Did you ever read it? It’s absolutely marvelous.
Librarian: No, I’m afraid I haven’t.
Holly Golightly: Well you should. He wrote it. He’s Varjak, Paul, in person.
She doesn’t believe me. Show her your driver’s license or diners’ club card or
something. Honestly he really is the author. Cross my heart and kiss my
elbow.
Librarian: Would you kindly lower your voice, Miss?
Holly Golightly: Why don’t you autograph it to her. Don’t you think that would
be nice? Sort of make it more personal?
Librarian: Really, miss...
Holly Golightly: Go ahead. Don’t be so stuck up. Autograph it to them.
Paul Varjak: What shall I say?
Holly Golightly: Something sentimental, I think.
Librarian: What are you doing? Stop that. You’re defacing public property.
Holly Golightly: Well alright, if that’s the way you feel, come on Fred darling,
let’s get out of here. I don’t think this place is half as nice as Tiffany’s.
Holly Golightly: Hey did you ever steal anything from a 5-and-10? When you
were a kid I mean.
Paul Varjak: No. I’m the sensitive, bookish type. Did you?
Holly Golightly: I used to. I still do now and then, sort of to keep my hand in.
come on. Don’t be chicken. Anyway, you’ve never done it, and it’s your turn.
I can’t see.
Paul Varjak: Hi, Cat. Lady of the house at home? Holly? Holly.
Paul Varjak: Trick or treat.
2E: You’re crazy. You know that, don’t you? But I love you anyway.
Paul Varjak: 2E.
2E: Yeah?
Paul Varjak: I’ve... got to talk to you.
2E: All right.
Paul Varjak: You want a drink?
2E: Uh-uh. If this is going to be a serious discussion, and suddenly I’m terribly
afraid it is, you’re going to have to take off that ridiculous mask. Or else I’m
going have to wear one, too.
Paul Varjak: 2E, look, please.
2E: What’s the matter? Girl trouble? Is that it, darling? Oh, I see. Well, that’s
not so serious. As a matter of fact, I’ve been expecting it. I can’t say I like it,
but I’ve been expecting it. Who is she?
Paul Varjak: Hasn’t got anything to do with her. This is between you and me.
2E: Oh. Then it is serious. Well, now.
Paul Varjak: 2E, you’re a very stylish girl. Can’t we end this stylishly?
2E: End it?
Paul Varjak: Yes.
2E: Well... I do believe love has found Andy hardy. Let’s see... a waitress? A
salesgirl? No. she’d have to be someone rich, wouldn’t she, Paul? Someone
who could help you.
Paul Varjak: Curiously enough... she’s a girl who can’t help anyone, not even
herself. The thing is, I can help her, and it’s a nice feeling for a change.
2E: All right. I understand. I’ll tell you what, Paul. I am a very stylish girl.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
2E: Writing a check. Don’t look so bewildered. Surely you’ve noticed me
writing checks before. Pay to the order of Paul Varjak-- $1,000. Take her
away somewhere for a week. You’re entitled to a vacation with pay. Simply a
matter of fair labor practice, darling. Of course if you were really smart, you’d
get the boys together and organize a union. That way you’d get all the fringe
benefits—hospitalization, a pension plan, and unemployment insurance when
you’re... how shall I put it? Between engagements.
Paul Varjak: Thanks for making it easier for me.
2E: Don’t be ridiculous, darling. Take the check. And call your girl.
Paul Varjak: No, thanks. I’ve got a check of my own. When you get yourself a
new writer to help, try and find one my size. That way you won’t have to even
shorten the sleeves.
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly! Hey!
Stranger: Oh! What are you doing?
Paul Varjak: Excuse me. Uh, I—I’m sorry. You look just like a girl I know
named Holly.
Stranger: Really?
Paul Varjak: I’m sorry.
Paul Varjak: Hi.
Holly Golightly: What do you want?
Paul Varjak: I want to talk to you.
Holly Golightly: I’m busy.
Paul Varjak: What are you doing?
Holly Golightly: Reading.
Paul Varjak: South America—land of wealth and promise?
Holly Golightly: It’s very interesting.
Paul Varjak: Let’s get out of here. I said let’s get out of here. I want to talk to
you.
Holly Golightly: Shh!
Paul Varjak: What’s the matter with you anyway? What’s happened?
Holly Golightly: Fred, will you please just leave me alone?
Paul Varjak: Holly. I love you.
Paul Varjak: Where are you going?
Holly Golightly: To the ladies room.
Paul Varjak: What’s the matter with you anyway?
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: No.
Holly Golightly: Fred, please let me go.
Paul Varjak: Let’s get something straight. I am not now nor have I ever been
Fred, nor am I Benny Shacklett, whoever he may be. My name is Paul—Paul
Varjak—and I love you.
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: Not till we get this settled. Now what’s all this jazz about south
America?
Holly Golightly: I thought if I’m marrying a south American, I’d better find out
something about the country.
Paul Varjak: Marry? What south American?
Holly Golightly: Jose.
Paul Varjak: Who the hell’s Jose?
Holly Golightly: Jose de Silva Pereira.
Paul Varjak: Who the hell’s Jose de Silva Pereira?
Holly Golightly: Darling, you met him. I know you did. Mag Wildwood’s
friend. The tall good looking one who came to the party with Rusty. Well, my
dear, you won’t believe this, but it turns out not only is he handsome and
wildly rich, he’s absolutely cuckoo for me.
Paul Varjak: You’re crazy.
Holly Golightly: What do you think you own me?
Paul Varjak: That’s exactly what I think.
Holly Golightly: I know, I know. That’s what everybody always thinks, but
everybody happens to be wrong.
Paul Varjak: Look, I am not everybody. Or am I? Is that what you really think?
That I’m no different from all your other rats and super rats? Wait a minute. If
that’s it... if that’s what you really think... there’s something I want to give you.
Holly Golightly: What’s that?
Paul Varjak: $50 for the powder room.
Holly Golightly: I wouldn’t ask you in, except the place is in such a mess, I
couldn’t bear to face it alone.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Ah, you have a message.
Holly Golightly: No.
Jose da Silva Pereira: ole.
Holly Golightly: Good evening, Mr. Yunioshi.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh, good evening, Paul.
Paul Varjak: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Good evening.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Please, you must help me.
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly!
Paul Varjak: Holly! Holly! Holly!
Holly Golightly: Let me go.
Paul Varjak: Holly. Holly.
Holly Golightly: Oh, Fred.
Paul Varjak: Holly.
Holly Golightly: No, no. Fred. Fred.
Paul Varjak: What did you do to her?
Jose da Silva Pereira: Nothing. There was a telegram, and then this—
crashing everything and acting like a crazy—it’s appalling. I can’t have a
public scandal. It’s too delicate—my name, my position, my family. Will there
be the police again? You think?
Paul Varjak: I don’t see why. There’s no law against busting up your
apartment. Where is the telegram?
Holly Golightly: There it is.
Paul Varjak: Received notice young Fred killed...” “In jeep accident, fort riley,
Kansas.” “Your husband and children join in the sorrow of our mutual loss.”
“Letter following. Love, Doc.” her brother Fred.
Jose da Silva Pereira: Oh. This brother, was she very close to him?
Paul Varjak: Yeah.
Jose da Silva Pereira: What can one do?
Paul Varjak: Try to help her. I tried. It didn’t do much good. You got a ranch
or something down in Brazil don’t you?
Jose da Silva Pereira: Yes.
Paul Varjak: That’s good. She’ll like that. Well, you better get in there.
Holly Golightly: Hi.
Paul Varjak: Hello. Got your wire. How did you know where to reach me?
Holly Golightly: Oh, I tried everything—called people, asked around, and
suddenly I thought of looking in the phone book. Anyway, I’m glad you could
come.
Paul Varjak: You look fine.
Holly Golightly: You think so? I’m fat as a pig, and I haven’t had my hair
done, but I’m happy, really happy. It probably shows. You look tres distingue
yourself.
Paul Varjak: I’ve got a job. I’ve been writing a little.
Holly Golightly: I know. I’ve read three of your stories—two in the New
Yorker and one in that funny little Magazine. Won’t you sit down?
Paul Varjak: Thank you.
Holly Golightly: I’ve taken up knitting.
Paul Varjak: So I see. It’ll probably look, uh...very nice once it’s finished.
Holly Golightly: Actually, I’m a little nervous about it. Jose brought up the
blueprints for a new ranch house he’s building. I have this strange feeling that
maybe the blueprints and my knitting instructions got switched. I mean it isn’t
impossible that I’m knitting a ranch house.
Holly Golightly: Really, darling, I can’t tell you how divinely happy I am.
Paul Varjak: What is that, anyhow?
Holly Golightly: Portuguese—a very complicated language. 4,000 irregular
verbs.
Holly Golightly: [speaking Portuguese]
Paul Varjak: Hmm. very impressive. What’s it mean?
Holly Golightly: I believe you are in league with the butcher.
Paul Varjak: Holly, what’s this about? Why did you want to see me?
Holly Golightly: Jose’s in Washington for the night, so I thought if I’d ask you
over. You might come. And, well, I’ve said goodbye to everyone else I care
about.
Paul Varjak: You’re going somewhere?
Holly Golightly: I’m going to Rio tomorrow. I’ve got the plane ticket, and I’ve
even said goodbye to ol’Sally.
Paul Varjak: Jose’s flying down with you?
Holly Golightly: Oh! We’re going on separate planes of course. He doesn’t
think it would look right for us to be traveling together. His family’s important
down there, so he has to worry about things like that. Anyway, I thought I’d
show off and cook dinner for us. It’ll be fun eating in. Did I tell you how divinely
and utterly happy I am?
Paul Varjak: Yes. You are getting married, then?
Holly Golightly: Well, he hasn’t really asked me, not in so many words.
Paul Varjak: Four, you mean?
Holly Golightly: Huh?
Paul Varjak: Well, that’s how many words it takes—will you marry me?
Holly Golightly: Oh, we’ll get married, all right. I know we will. And in church
and with his family there and everything. And that’s why he’s waiting till we get
to Rio... probably.
Paul Varjak: Do you think it’s trying to tell us something?
Holly Golightly: I hope you like chicken and saffron rice served with
chocolate sauce. It’s an East Indian classic, my dear. Three months ago, I
couldn’t scramble eggs.
Holly Golightly: Oh, are you all right?
Holly Golightly: Oh. Oh, golly, darling. I did so want to impress you.
Paul Varjak: Look, I’m not much for chicken with sauce anyway. Why don’t
we go out somewhere? Let me buy you a farewell dinner.
Holly Golightly: Oh, that would be fun, as long as it’s someplace I can go like
this.
Holly Golightly: Years from now, years and years, I’ll be back—me and my
nine Brazilian brats. They’ll be dark like Jose, of course, but they’ll have bright
green, beautiful eyes. I’ll bring them back, all right, because they must see
this. Oh, I love New York.
Paul Varjak: Then why are you leaving? What’s in it for you anyway?
Holly Golightly: Look, I know what you’re thinking, and I don’t blame you.
I’ve always thrown out such a jazzy line, but really, except for Doc and
yourself, Jose’s my first nonrat romance. Not that he’s my idea of the absolute
finito. He’s too prim and cautious to be my absolute ideal. Now, if I could
choose from anybody alive, I wouldn’t pick Jose. Nero, maybe, or Albert
Schweitzer... or Leonard Bernstein. But I am mad about Jose. I honestly think
I’d give up smoking if he asked me. Come on, darling. Let’s eat. It’s getting
late. I’m leaving tomorrow, and I haven’t even begun to pack.
Holly Golightly: Didn’t want Jose to think I was the kind of girl who loses her
key, so I had 26 of them made. Wait. I got a better idea. Kind of a farewell
gesture.
Paul Varjak: Somebody must have tripped the lock.
Holly Golightly: Ah, crafty devil, that Yunioshi. Wake up, wake up! The
British are coming!
Paul Varjak: Or, in this case, the Brazilians.
Holly Golightly: Exactly.
Paul Varjak: Exactly.
Holly Golightly: Ooh, I’ve still got to clean up all that rice.
Paul Varjak: Hey, you know—hey!
Mr. Yunioshi: Aaahh! There she are lieutenant. There she is who did it! The
wanted woman! There!
Police officer 1: Groenburger. Narcotics squad.
Holly Golightly: What do you mean?
Paul Varjak: What’s going on?
Police officer 1: Why don’t you ask your boss?
Paul Varjak: What boss?
Police officer 1: Sally Tomato. Ask him. Come on.
Mr. Yunioshi: There’s much more than tomato! Look around for narcotic!
They got plenty narcotic in there.

Holly Golightly: Good.
Holly Golightly: I can’t answer all your questions. One at a time.
Police Woman: Wait a minute
Holly Golightly: One at a time.
Police Woman: Knock it off!
Holly Golightly: Now, darling, why don’t you start?
Reporter 1: Is it true you carried messages from Tomato in code?
Holly Golightly: Of course not. I’d just meet Mr. O’Shaughnessy at
Hamburger Heaven and give him the weather report. Simply do not ask me
what this is all about. parce que je ne sais pas, mes chers.
Reporter 2: But you did use to visit Tomato?
Holly Golightly: I used to see him every week. What’s wrong with that?
Reporter 3: Well you must have known that Tomato was part of the narcotics
syndicate.
Holly Golightly: Mr. Tomato never mentioned narcotics to me. Makes me
furious that way all these wretched people keep persecuting him. He’s a
deeply sensitive person, a darling old man.
Reporter 1: Then you’re innocent.
Holly Golightly: Of course I’m innocent.
Reporter 2: What are you going to do about it?
Holly Golightly: What do you mean?
Reporter 3: Well, who’s your lawyer?
Holly Golightly: I don’t know. Mr. O’Shaughnessy, I guess. Mr.
O’Shaughnessy!
Mr. O’Shaughnessy: Hey! Get out of here!
Police officer: All right, come on!
Police officer: Okay. Move.

Operator: Ready with Mr. Berman in Hollywood. Kindly deposit $3.00 for the
first 3 minutes, please.
Paul Varjak: Hello? Hello?
O.J. Berman: O.J. Berman here. Who’s calling?
Paul Varjak: Mr. Berman, this is Paul Varjak.
O.J. Berman: Nice to talk to you, kid.
Paul Varjak: Varjak. V-a-r-j-a-k. I’m a friend of Holly’s. I met you at a party in
New York.
O.J. Berman: Who?
Paul Varjak: Paul. Paul Varjak. V-a-r... Mr. Berman, this is Fred.
O.J. Berman: Oh, Fred, baby, huh? So you called about the kid, huh?
Everything’s under control. Hey, you just relax. I spoke to my lawyer in New
York. I told him to take care of everything, send me the bill, but to keep my
name anonymous.
Paul Varjak: What?
O.J. Berman: I don’t want any part of it. You hear me?
Paul Varjak: You sound like you’re in a tunnel.
O.J. Berman: Oh! It’s this executive phone I have.
Paul Varjak: What?
O.J. Berman: Executive phone! Fred baby, they only got her on 10,000 bail.
My lawyer can get her out at 10 o’clock this morning. I tell you what you do.
You bust into that dump she lives in, collect all her junk, go down to the jail,
get her out, and take her straight over to a hotel under a phony name. Right.
You want to keep her away from the reporters as much as possible. You know
what I mean? Will you do that?
Paul Varjak: Sure, Mr. Berman. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate—
O.J. Berman: Forget it. I mean, I owe her something. not that I owe her
anything if you really want to get right down to it, but...she’s a crazy. She’s a
phony. But she’s a real phony. Know what I mean, kid?
Paul Varjak: Yeah, I know what you mean. Thanks, Mr. Berman. Thanks a
lot.
O.J. Berman: Right!
O.J. Berman: Oh why don’t you behave?
Holly Golightly: Quel night.
Paul Varjak: I did a little housebreaking while you were away. Clayton hotel,
driver. 84th and Madison. O.J. thinks it would be a good idea if you stayed out
of sight for a while. I got most your stuff here, including Cat. Hope he’s all
right.
Holly Golightly: Hello, Cat... poor no-name slob. Listen, darling, did you find
that plane ticket?
Paul Varjak: Right here. We can cash it in.
Holly Golightly: Cash it in? Are you kidding? What time is it?
Paul Varjak: A little after 10:00.
Holly Golightly: Good. Idyllwild airport please, driver.
Paul Varjak: Never mind. You can’t do that.
Holly Golightly: Why not?
Paul Varjak: You don’t understand. You’re under indictment. If they catch you
jumping bail; they’ll lock you up and throw away the key.
Holly Golightly: Don’t be ridiculous, darling. By the day after tomorrow, I’ll be
married to the future president of Brazil. And that’ll give me diplomatic
immunity or something.
Paul Varjak: I wouldn’t bet on it.
Holly Golightly: What is it, darling?
Paul Varjak: I have a message for you.
Holly Golightly: Oh. Oh, yes, I see. Did he bring it in person, or was it... just
there, shoved under the door?
Paul Varjak: A cousin.
Holly Golightly: Hand me my purse, will you, darling? A girl can’t read that
sort of thing... with …. Without her lipstick. You read it to me, will you, darling?
I don’t think I can quite...bear...
Paul Varjak: Are you sure you want me to?
Holly Golightly: Mm-hmm.
Paul Varjak: Okay. “My dearest little girl, I have loved you knowing you were
not as others, but conceive of my despair upon discovering in such a brutal
and public style how very different you are from the manner of woman a man
of my position could hope to make his wife. I grieve for the disgrace of your
present circumstances, and I do not find it in my heart to add my condemn...
to the condemn that surrounds you. So I hope you will find it in your heart not
to condemn me. I have my family to protect and my name and...I am a coward
where these institutions enter. Forget me, beautiful child, and may god be with
you. Jose.”
Holly Golightly: Well...
Paul Varjak: Well, at least he’s honest. It’s kind of touching.
Holly Golightly: Touching! That square-ball jazz.
Paul Varjak: He says he’s a coward.
Holly Golightly: All right! So he’s not a regular rat or even a super rat. He’s
just a scared little mouse, that’s all. But, oh, golly... gee! Damn!
Paul Varjak: Well, so much for south America. I didn’t really think you were
cut out to be queen of the pampas anyway. Clayton hotel.
Holly Golightly: Idyllwild.
Paul Varjak: What?
Holly Golightly: The plane leaves at 12:00, and on it I plan to be.
Paul Varjak: Holly, you can’t.
Holly Golightly: Ne pourquoi pas? I’m not hotfooting it after Jose, if that’s
what you think. Oh, no. as far as I’m concerned, he’s the future president of
nowhere. Only why should I waste a perfectly good plane ticket? Besides, I’ve
never been to brazil. Please, darling, don’t sit there looking at me like that. I’m
going, and that’s all there is to it. All they want from me are my services as a
state’s witness against Sally. Nobody has any intention of prosecuting me. To
begin with, they don’t have a ghost of a chance. Even so this town’s finished
for me... at least for a while. There are certain shades of limelight that can
wreck a girl’s complexion. They’ll have the rope up at every saloon in town. I’ll
tell you what you do for me, darling. When you get back to town, I want you to
call up the New York times or whoever you call. I want you to mail me a list of
the 50 richest men in brazil—the 50 richest!
Paul Varjak: Holly. I’m not going to let you do this.
Holly Golightly: You’re not going to let me?
Paul Varjak: Holly, I’m in love with you.
Holly Golightly: So what?
Paul Varjak: So what? So plenty! I love you. You belong to me.
Holly Golightly: No. people don’t belong to people.
Paul Varjak: Of course they do.
Holly Golightly: I’m not going to let anyone put me in a cage.
Paul Varjak: I don’t want to put you in a cage! I want to love you!
Holly Golightly: It’s the same thing.
Paul Varjak: No, it’s not! Holly!
Holly Golightly: I’m not Holly. I’m not Lula Mae, either. I don’t know who I
am! I’m like Cat here, We’re a couple of no-name slobs. We belong to
nobody, and nobody belongs to us. We don’t even belong to each other. Stop
the cab. What do you think? This ought to be the right kind place for a tough
guy like you—garbage cans, rats galore. Scram! I said take off! Beat it! Let’s
go.
Paul Varjak: Driver... pull over here. You know what’s wrong with you, miss
whoever-you-are? You’re chicken. You got no guts. You’re afraid to stick out
your chin and say, “o.k., life’s a fact.” people do fall in love. People do belong
to each other, because that’s the only chance anybody’s got for real
happiness. You call yourself a free spirit, a wild thing. And you’re terrified
somebody’s going to stick you in a cage. Well, baby, you’re already in that
cage. You built it yourself. And it’s not bounded in the west by Tulip, Texas, or
in the east by Somaliland. It’s wherever you go. Because no matter where you
run, you just end up running into yourself. Here. I’ve been carrying this thing
around for months. I don’t want it anymore.
Paul: Here, Cat! Cat!
Holly Golightly: Where’s the Cat?

Paul Varjak: I don’t know.
Holly Golightly: Cat. Cat! Cat! Cat! Cat! Cat! Oh, Cat. Cat.

I slip brothers in the deck, on my cellular phone

And a dip on the other end wantin' to put me down now)
No hesitation, I hops to it
See it ain't easy bein' a Mac but somebody gotta do it

[Intro]
A: Because I got it like that, uh huh
Because I got it like that, wooh, uh huh
Because I got it like that
G: Like how?
A: Like that

[Verse 1: Afrika, Mike G]
Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step on stage, you scream for more
Afrika got rhymes galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me
Left or right side, take your pick
But girl, you've got to make it quick
Baby, baby, baby
I know I drive you crazy

MC's know me as Mike G
Girls hold on to me tightly
Warm personality
That's why they get close to me
Try their best to drive me wild
Say they want to bear my child
I go away, they say, ""Come back""
Why? Because I got it like that

[Chorus]

A: Yeah, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: Yeah, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: A ha ha, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
A: Like how?
G: Like that

[Verse 2: Afrika, Mike G]
No problem, (why?) because I got it like that
A Baby Bam beat and an African rap
My partner by my side, Sammy B is on the cut
Your DJs chill and chill, but hey, so what?
Nuggets in my pocket, wine in my hand
I got it like that, but you still don't understand
It comes to me natural, it comes to me easy
I just lay back and let the big beat lead me
I never work a day in my life
Single jungle brother, no kids, no wife
100,000 rhymes from one band, that's many
But back where I come from, they ain't worth a penny
You've got a lot of talent, but you fail to see
You paid for yours, I got mine for free

Play in the rain and don't get wet
Walk through the desert and don't even sweat
Play in the snow and don't get cold
I'm just a cool young brother who looks kinda old
Run around the world schoolin' on the side
If I commit a crime and get caught i slide
I've got ladies uptown and money on the floor
There's not a thing in the world that I'm askin' for

[Chorus 2]
A: Wooh, uh huh
G: Because I got it like that
You wanna know why, brother?
Because I got it like that
A: Uh huh
G: I ain't jokin', I ain't playin', it's just my brother
I got it like that
A: A ha ha

[Verse 3: Afrika]
Used to be a player, couldn't be trusted
But still in all, I never got busted
Knowin' every part of New York City
I thought it was funny, it used to look pretty
I had it all spread out, even one next door
I had it like that, so what ya askin' for?
4 to 5, you see, was my minimum
And every day, I used to go and get with 'em
One for every hour on the hour
One on the way while I was in the shower
It sounds kinda crazy, it sounds kinda bugged
But you see, Afrika was the one they loved
So you see, it got to a point where they didn't care
They didn't wanna give me up, so they agreed to share

[Chorus 3]
A: Because I got it like that
G: I hear you, brother, word
A: Because I got it like that
G: Man, you's one baaaaaad jungle brother

Do you ever ask yourself... when those Bad Boys are GONNA STOP MAKING ALL THAT MONEY?!

[Verse 1: Styles P]
I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrera
For now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light up a sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust off the Ruger
Ladies and gentleman, bullets will leave you tremblin'
Shooken up, I got my Cuban mami cooking up
We got it all from her-on to fishscale
New York to Israel, get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like the five with strobes
Goons around the globe, honeys wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the Feds: catch me if you can
I'ma still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Quick to get there, bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm waitin' on a hunnid grand
So I can hit the mote' and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and now that money in the tower
Stash box with the key

Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf'
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seams
While you sonning me like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your dual cassette running me
Wanna get in front of me playa, but you can't get none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming, B
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
When you want it? now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved with Montega bricks
Niggas is mega sick, and you know we roll mega-thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, damn, ain't that somethin'?
All that for frontin', what you gon' do? Nothing!
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write butter, nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' honeys
Niggas is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that; that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fat nicks
Gats with mad clips, TVs in your whips
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryna get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so our shits match
Runnin' around all crazy, twistin' honeys back
And breakin' niggas that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all; I never knew y'all

Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryna get stuck
So I'ma keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect, TEC-9s, and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with honeys crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Louchian the mayor
Don't stop, I'm not finished yet
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit
So the town supports this (uh-huh)

Givin' parades, and holdin' rallies for the lifers; groups
So what you gwan' do when they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing, and bubble gum chewing (woooo!)
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'?
Rocking Vansons while I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to the life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how we locks this

Smokin' cigars in Bogota with Colombian niggas
Named Panama and Englique and shit (wooo!)
Games we play, life-endin'
Bitches bendin' over with ease for a pair of Mo-schi-no jeans
And Donna Karan tank top, I got your bank stopped
Singles on top, Benjamins under the rest of 'em (don't stop!)
Advancin' from duplex to mansions
Stashin' keys, hidin' Gs overseas, VCRs in my Vs
Game elevates, money I make
Into stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribbean
White sands, discussin' plans with my mans
Dark blue Land, smoke tint, chrome rims and a system
That leaves my rear views tremblin'

309,Soon As I Get Home,"[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder ""How long will I last?""
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas are shady so I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me, you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood – soon as I get home

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is ""Keep it real or you can die squeelin'.""
Plus, I never had to worry 'bout a visit, ‘cause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissin', steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscin', everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the mornin', it's on soon as I get home

[Chorus: 2Pac]
Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe

Soon as I get home

[Verse 3: Yaki Khadafi]
Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big, like the kid from Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and Mama survivin'
Depends on how many rocks a young nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love with these herbs
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that shoulda been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home

311,"Exhale (Shoop Shoop) (From ""Waiting To Exhale"")","LETTER V

Had I determined to travel in Sweden merely for pleasure, I should probably have chosen the road to Stockholm, though convinced, by repeated observation, that the manners of a people are best discriminated in the country.  The inhabitants of the capital are of the same genus; for the varieties in the species we must, therefore, search where the habitations of men are so separated as to allow the difference of climate to have its natural effect.  And with this difference we are, perhaps, most forcibly struck at the first view, just as we form an estimate of the leading traits of a character at the first glance, of which intimacy afterwards makes us almost lose sight.

As my affairs called me to Stromstad (the frontier town of Sweden) in my way to Norway, I was to pass over, I heard, the most uncultivated part of the country.  Still I believe that the grand features of Sweden are the same everywhere, and it is only the grand features that admit of description.  There is an individuality in every prospect, which remains in the memory as forcibly depicted as the particular features that have arrested our attention; yet we cannot find words to discriminate that individuality so as to enable a stranger to say, this is the face, that the view.  We may amuse by setting the imagination to work; but we cannot store the memory with a fact.

As I wish to give you a general idea of this country, I shall continue in my desultory manner to make such observations and reflections as the circumstances draw forth, without losing time, by endeavouring to arrange them.

Travelling in Sweden is very cheap, and even commodious, if you make but the proper arrangements.  Here, as in other parts of the Continent, it is necessary to have your own carriage, and to have a servant who can speak the language, if you are unacquainted with it.  Sometimes a servant whose can drive would be found very useful, which was our case, for I travelled in company with two gentlemen, one of whom had a German servant who drove very well.  This was all the party; for not intending to make a long stay, I left my little girl behind me.

As the roads are not much frequented, to avoid waiting three or four hours for horses, we sent, as is the constant custom, an avant courier the night before, to order them at every post, and we constantly found them ready.  Our first set I jokingly termed requisition horses; but afterwards we had almost always little spirited animals that went on at a round pace.

The roads, making allowance for the ups and downs, are uncommonly good and pleasant.  The expense, including the postillions and other incidental things, does not amount to more than a shilling the Swedish mile.

The inns are tolerable; but not liking the rye bread, I found it necessary to furnish myself with some wheaten before I set out.  The beds, too, were particularly disagreeable to me.  It seemed to me that I was sinking into a grave when I entered them; for, immersed in down placed in a sort of box, I expected to be suffocated before morning.  The sleeping between two down beds—they do so even in summer—must be very unwholesome during any season; and I cannot conceive how the people can bear it, especially as the summers are very warm.  But warmth they seem not to feel; and, I should think, were afraid of the air, by always keeping their windows shut.  In the winter, I am persuaded, I could not exist in rooms thus closed up, with stoves heated in their manner, for they only put wood into them twice a day; and, when the stove is thoroughly heated, they shut the flue, not admitting any air to renew its elasticity, even when the rooms are crowded with company.  These stoves are made of earthenware, and often in a form that ornaments an apartment, which is never the case with the heavy iron ones I have seen elsewhere.  Stoves may be economical, but I like a fire, a wood one, in preference; and I am convinced that the current of air which it attracts renders this the best mode of warming rooms.

We arrived early the second evening at a little village called Quistram, where we had determined to pass the night, having been informed that we should not afterwards find a tolerable inn until we reached Stromstad.

Advancing towards Quistram, as the sun was beginning to decline, I was particularly impressed by the beauty of the situation.  The road was on the declivity of a rocky mountain, slightly covered with the mossy herbage and vagrant firs.  At the bottom, a river, straggling amongst the recesses of stone, was hastening forward to the ocean and its grey rocks, of which we had a prospect on the left; whilst on the right it stole peacefully forward into the meadows, losing itself in a thickly-wooded rising ground.  As we drew near, the loveliest banks of wild flowers variegated the prospect, and promised to exhale odours to add to the sweetness of the air, the purity of which you could almost see, alas! Not a smell, for the putrefying herrings, which they use as manure, after the oil has been extracted, spread over the patches of earth, claimed by cultivation, destroyed every other.

It was intolerable, and entered with us into the inn, which was in other respects a charming retreat.

Whilst supper was preparing I crossed the bridge, and strolled by the river, listening to its murmurs.  Approaching the bank, the beauty of which had attracted my attention in the carriage, I recognised many of my old acquaintance growing with great luxuriance.

Seated on it, I could not avoid noting an obvious remark.  Sweden appeared to me the country in the world most proper to form the botanist and natural historian; every object seemed to remind me of the creation of things, of the first efforts of sportive nature.  When a country arrives at a certain state of perfection, it looks as if it were made so; and curiosity is not excited.  Besides, in social life too many objects occur for any to be distinctly observed by the generality of mankind; yet a contemplative man, or poet, in the country—I do not mean the country adjacent to cities—feels and sees what would escape vulgar eyes, and draws suitable inferences.  This train of reflections might have led me further, in every sense of the word; but I could not escape from the detestable evaporation of the herrings, which poisoned all my pleasure.

After making a tolerable supper—for it is not easy to get fresh provisions on the road—I retired, to be lulled to sleep by the murmuring of a stream, of which I with great difficulty obtained sufficient to perform my daily ablutions.
The last battle between the Danes and Swedes, which gave new life to their ancient enmity, was fought at this place 1788; only seventeen or eighteen were killed, for the great superiority of the Danes and Norwegians obliged the Swedes to submit; but sickness, and a scarcity of provision, proved very fatal to their opponents on their return.

It would be very easy to search for the particulars of this engagement in the publications of the day; but as this manner of filling my pages does not come within my plan, I probably should not have remarked that the battle was fought here, were it not to relate an anecdote which I had from good authority.

I noticed when I first mentioned this place to you, that we descended a steep before we came to the inn; an immense ridge of rocks stretching out on one side.  The inn was sheltered under them; and about a hundred yards from it was a bridge that crossed the river, the murmurs of which I have celebrated; it was not fordable.  The Swedish general received orders to stop at the bridge and dispute the passage—a most advantageous post for an army so much inferior in force; but the influence of beauty is not confined to courts.  The mistress of the inn was handsome; when I saw her there were still some remains of beauty; and, to preserve her house, the general gave up the only tenable station.  He was afterwards broke for contempt of orders.

Approaching the frontiers, consequently the sea, nature resumed an aspect ruder and ruder, or rather seemed the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty.  Still it was sublime.

The clouds caught their hue of the rocks that menaced them.  The sun appeared afraid to shine, the birds ceased to sing, and the flowers to bloom; but the eagle fixed his nest high amongst the rocks, and the vulture hovered over this abode of desolation.  The farm houses, in which only poverty resided, were formed of logs scarcely keeping off the cold and drifting snow: out of them the inhabitants seldom peeped, and the sports or prattling of children was either seen or heard.  The current of life seemed congealed at the source: all were not frozen, for it was summer, you remember; but everything appeared so dull that I waited to see ice, in order to reconcile me to the absence of gaiety.

The day before, my attention had frequently been attracted by the wild beauties of the country we passed through.

The rocks which tossed their fantastic heads so high were often covered with pines and firs, varied in the most picturesque manner.  Little woods filled up the recesses when forests did not darken the scene, and valleys and glens, cleared of the trees, displayed a dazzling verdure which contrasted with the gloom of the shading pines.  The eye stole into many a covert where tranquility seemed to have taken up her abode, and the number of little lakes that continually presented themselves added to the peaceful composure of the scenery.  The little cultivation which appeared did not break the enchantment, nor did castles rear their turrets aloft to crush the cottages, and prove that man is more savage than the natives of the woods.  I heard of the bears but never saw them stalk forth, which I was sorry for; I wished to have seen one in its wild state.  In the winter, I am told, they sometimes catch a stray cow, which is a heavy loss to the owner.

The farms are small.  Indeed most of the houses we saw on the road indicated poverty, or rather that the people could just live.  Towards the frontiers they grew worse and worse in their appearance, as if not willing to put sterility itself out of countenance.  No gardens smiled round the habitations, not a potato or cabbage to eat with the fish drying on a stick near the door.  A little grain here and there are appeared, the long stalks of which you might almost reckon.  The day was gloomy when we passed over this rejected spot, the wind bleak, and winter seemed to be contending with nature, faintly struggling to change the season.  Surely, thought I, if the sun ever shines here it cannot warm these stones; moss only cleaves to them, partaking of their hardness, and nothing like vegetable life appears to cheer with hope the heart.

So far from thinking that the primitive inhabitants of the world lived in a southern climate where Paradise spontaneously arose, I am led to infer, from various circumstances, that the first dwelling of man happened to be a spot like this which led him to adore a sun so seldom seen; for this worship, which probably preceded that of demons or demigods, certainly never began in a southern climate, where the continual presence of the sun prevented its being considered as a good; or rather the want of it never being felt, this glorious luminary would carelessly have diffused its blessings without being hailed as a benefactor.  Man must therefore have been placed in the north, to tempt him to run after the sun, in order that the different parts of the earth might be peopled.  Nor do I wonder that hordes of barbarians always poured out of these regions to seek for milder climes, when nothing like cultivation attached them to the soil, especially when we take into the view that the adventuring spirit, common to man, is naturally stronger and more general during the infancy of society.  The conduct of the followers of Mahomet, and the crusaders, will sufficiently corroborate my assertion.

Approaching nearer to Stromstad, the appearance of the town proved to be quite in character with the country we had just passed through.  I hesitated to use the word country, yet could not find another; still it would sound absurd to talk of fields of rocks.

The town was built on and under them.  Three or four weather-beaten trees were shrinking from the wind, and the grass grew so sparingly that I could not avoid thinking Dr. Johnson’s hyperbolical assertion “that the man merited well of his country who made a few blades of grass grow where they never grew before,” might here have been uttered with strict propriety.  The steeple likewise towered aloft, for what is a church, even amongst the Lutherans, without a steeple?  But to prevent mischief in such an exposed situation, it is wisely placed on a rock at some distance not to endanger the roof of the church.

Rambling about, I saw the door open, and entered, when to my great surprise I found the clergyman reading prayers, with only the clerk attending.  I instantly thought of Swift’s “Dearly beloved Roger,” but on inquiry I learnt that some one had died that morning, and in Sweden it is customary to pray for the dead.

The sun, who I suspected never dared to shine, began now to convince me that he came forth only to torment; for though the wind was still cutting, the rocks became intolerably warm under my feet, whilst the herring effluvia, which I before found so very offensive, once more assailed me.  I hastened back to the house of a merchant, the little sovereign of the place, because he was by far the richest, though not the mayor.

Here we were most hospitably received, and introduced to a very fine and numerous families.  I have before mentioned to you the lilies of the north, I might have added, water lilies, for the complexion of many, even of the young women, seem to be bleached on the bosom of snow.  But in this youthful circle the roses bloomed with all their wonted freshness, and I wondered from whence the fire was stolen which sparkled in their fine blue eyes.

Here we slept; and I rose early in the morning to prepare for my little voyage to Norway.  I had determined to go by water, and was to leave my companions behind; but not getting a boat immediately, and the wind being high and unfavourable, I was told that it was not safe to go to sea during such boisterous weather; I was, therefore, obliged to wait for the morrow, and had the present day on my hands, which I feared would be irksome, because the family, who possessed about a dozen French words amongst them and not an English phrase, were anxious to amuse me, and would not let me remain alone in my room.  The town we had already walked round and round, and if we advanced farther on the coast, it was still to view the same unvaried immensity of water surrounded by barrenness.

The gentlemen, wishing to peep into Norway, proposed going to Frederic Hall, the first town—the distance was only three Swedish miles.  There and back again was but a day’s journey, and would not, I thought, interfere with my voyage.  I agreed, and invited the eldest and prettiest of the girls to accompany us.  I invited her because I like to see a beautiful face animated by pleasure, and to have an opportunity of regarding the country, whilst the gentlemen were amusing themselves with her.

I did not know, for I had not thought of it, that we were to scale some of the most mountainous cliffs of Sweden in our way to the ferry which separates the two countries.

Entering amongst the cliffs, we were sheltered from the wind, warm sunbeams began to play, streams to flow, and groves of pines diversified the rocks.  Sometimes they became suddenly bare and sublime.  Once, in particular, after mounting the most terrific precipice, we had to pass through a tremendous defile, where the closing chasm seemed to threaten us with instant destruction, when, turning quickly, verdant meadows and a beautiful lake relieved and charmed my eyes.

I had never travelled through Switzerland, but one of my companions assured me that I should not there find anything superior, if equal, to the wild grandeur of these views.

As we had not taken this excursion into our plan, the horses had not been previously ordered, which obliged us to wait two hours at the first post.  The day was wearing away.  The road was so bad that walking up the precipices consumed the time insensibly; but as we desired horses at each post ready at a certain hour, we reckoned on returning more speedily.

We stopped to dine at a tolerable farm; they brought us out ham, butter, cheese, and milk, and the charge was so moderate that I scattered a little money amongst the children who were peeping at us, in order to pay them for their trouble.
Arrived at the ferry, we were still detained, for the people who attend at the ferries have a stupid kind of sluggishness in their manner, which is very provoking when you are in haste.  At present I did not feel it, for, scrambling up the cliffs, my eye followed the river as it rolled between the grand rocky banks; and, to complete the scenery, they were covered with firs and pines, through which the wind rustled as if it were lulling itself to sleep with the declining sun.

Behold us now in Norway; and I could not avoid feeling surprise at observing the difference in the manners of the inhabitants of the two sides of the river, for everything shows that the Norwegians are more industrious and more opulent.  The Swedes (for neighbours are seldom the best friends) accuse the Norwegians of knavery, and they retaliate by bringing a charge of hypocrisy against the Swedes.  Local circumstances probably render both unjust, speaking from their feelings rather than reason; and is the astonishing when we consider that most writers of travels have done the same, whose works have served as materials for the compilers of universal histories?  All are eager to give a national character, which is rarely just, because they do not discriminate the natural from the acquired difference.  The natural, I believe, on due consideration, will be found to consist merely in the degree of vivacity, or thoughtfulness, pleasures or pain, inspired by the climate, whilst the varieties which the forms of government, including religion, produce are much more numerous and unstable.

A people have been characterised as stupid by nature; what a paradox! Because they did not consider that slaves, having no object to stimulate industry; have not their faculties sharpened by the only thing that can exercise them, self-interest.  Others have been brought forward as brutes, having no aptitude for the arts and sciences, only because the progress of improvement had not reached that stage which produces them.

Those writers who have considered the history of man, or of the human mind, on a more enlarged scale have fallen into similar errors, not reflecting that the passions are weak where the necessaries of life are too hardly or too easily obtained.

Travellers who require that every nation should resemble their native country, had better stay at home.  It is, for example, absurd to blame a people for not having that degree of personal cleanliness and elegance of manners which only refinement of taste produces, and will produce everywhere in proportion as society attain a general polish.  The most essential service, I presume, that authors could render to society, would be to promote inquiry and discussion, instead of making those dogmatically assertions which only appear calculated to gird the human mind round with imaginary circles, like the paper globe which represents the one he inhabits.

This spirit of inquiry is the characteristic of the present century, from which the succeeding will, I am persuaded, receive a great accumulation of knowledge; and doubtless its diffusion will in a great measure destroy the factitious national characters which have been supposed permanent, though only rendered so by the permanency of ignorance.

Arriving at Frederic Hall at the siege of which Charles XII lost his life, we had only time to take a transient view of it whilst they were preparing us some refreshment.

Poor Charles!  I thought of him with respect.  I have always felt the same for Alexander, with whom he has been classed as a madman by several writers, who have reasoned superficially, confounding the morals of the day with the few grand principles on which unchangeable morality rests.  Making no allowance for the ignorance and prejudices of the period, they do not perceive how much they themselves are indebted to general improvement for the acquirements, and even the virtues, which they would not have had the force of mind to attain by their individual exertions in a less advanced state of society.

The evening was fine, as is usual at this season, and the refreshing odour of the pine woods became more perceptible, for it was nine o’clock when we left Frederic Hall.  At the ferry we were detained by a dispute relative to our Swedish passport, which we did not think of getting countersigned in Norway.  Midnight was coming on, yet it might with such propriety have been termed the noon of night that, had Young ever travels towards the north, I should not have wondered at his becoming enamoured of the moon.  But it is not the Queen of Night alone who reigns here in all her splendor, though the sun, loitering just below the horizon, decks her within a golden tinge from his car, illuminating the cliffs that hide him; the heavens also, of a clear softened blue, throw her forward, and the evening star appears a smaller moon to the naked eye.  The huge shadows of the rocks, fringed with firs, concentrating the views without darkening them, excited that tender melancholy which, sublimating the imagination, exalts rather than depresses the mind.

My companions fell asleep—fortunately they did not snore; and I contemplated, fearless of idle questions, a night such as I had never before seen or felt, to charm the senses, and calm the heart.  The very air was balmy as it freshened into morn, producing the most voluptuous sensations.  A vague pleasurable sentiment absorbed me, as I opened my bosom to the embraces of nature; and my soul rose to its Author, with the chirping of the solitary birds, which began to feel, rather than see, advancing day.  I had leisure to mark its progress.  The grey morn, streaked with silvery rays, ushered in the orient beams (how beautifully varying into purple!), yet I was sorry to lose the soft watery clouds which preceded them, exciting a kind of expectation that made me almost afraid to breathe, lest I should break the charm.  I saw the sun—and sighed.

One of my companions, now awake, perceiving that the postillions had mistaken the road, began to swear at him, and roused the other two, who reluctantly shook off sleep.

We had immediately to measure back our steps, and did not reach Stromstad before five in the morning.
The wind had changed in the night, and my boat was ready.

A dish of coffee, and fresh linen, recruited my spirits, and I directly set out again for Norway, purposing to land much higher up the coast.
Wrapping my great-coat round me, I lay down on some sails at the bottom of the boat, its motion rocking me to rest, till a discourteous wave interrupted my slumbers, and obliged me to rise and feel a solitariness which was not so soothing as that of the past night.

Find it hard to teach the people when they're hungry, cos the baby's gotta eat and everything cost money, But
No excuses we become a race of losers and the other nations use us for they come up when they choose tuh'

We, hah!
This is Funk Doctor Spot!
As we look, at our clocks
We gonna take you, on a ship to another journey
To the Darkside
Hah, we've conquered, new evidence, that there is life

[Verse 1]
My funk prognosis make my brains comatose
One hundred percent funk runs bloodstreams through your nose
I don't have to be Madonna, to make your eyes freeze
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the Thai weed
For this, you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood and boondox
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks
Now who kicks that phenomical, astronomical? Uhh
That's my nine in you; feelin' nauseous? That's my rhyme in you
I swing funk like nunchucks, my game's death
That's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul
Hot like Worchestire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech
My funk speech make words wear sun visors
I'm gettin' down with the funk in your trunk
Def Squad's in the house for *95* for all you punks

[Hook 4X: Q-Tip]
Coming down the block, man, loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk

[Verse 2]
Ahhh, I'm just as high as three pilled up motherfuckers
Def Squad's in the house for *95* you suckers
Punks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once, twice
I'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight
The top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped
I'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia
I'm swifter than roller blades on Ice Capades
I'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid
My grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama
I never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters
My style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef
Def like Jam or Squad, or Def like Lep
One, two! Big up to my niggas on one-deuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*
Rrrrrah! With weed for you!
Who says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?
I cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers
'Cause Redman will bomb just like Saddam
When I'm loose I'm worldwide like Triple F.A.T. Goose
Heavily armed

Now what makes the world go round besides checks?
Everybody give it to me S-E-X
Now with the proper equipment, it works best
And nothing less, relieves stress
Now if she says yes, you know I gotta knock it
Cause you saw me poppin like Orvell Redenbacher
In case you need a notion, Hennessey's the potion
Hit the climax if you want the sex lotion
CUM CUM now are you really that umm Dumb Dumb
On these cool procedures bout gettin some some
Putang, when it comes to ""P"" I'm a ""G"" and
Daddy never taught me bout the birds and the bees
But I, took a hint and with a little motion
Stuck it in a chick and had her flowin like an ocean
And now I gotta have it, just like a rabbit
Fuck Fuck Fuck with the semi-automatic

[Chorus]
Cause OOOOOOOOOOOO I like that Physical Funk
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I like that Physical Funk
I-I-I-I-I like that Physical Funk

Especially the kind with that junk in the trunk

[Verse 2: Domino]
Now if I choose you lady, Baby Baby Baby
If you and I can practice making babies
But heres a little something that you should know
I don't test the rain without the raincoat
Now if you one of those who don't like a rubber on your lover
Then the niggie Domino can truely find another
Wait... for me to give you a sex shower
And the good thing about it is it don't take an hour
For me to go from attention to at ease
Baby, try to take an easy on me please
Sexy ass freak, your love is so sweet
But you can kill a man with the tip of your teeth
So not too slow and not too fast
And I like to see a sexy with a string in her ass
Now tell me, are you that chunk of the month?
Then maybe we can share a little Physical Funk

[Chorus]

So now you know, Physical Funk is the Pump
And the bump which I like to stunts
And this is how I do it, back in the hood
Can't seem to go without nature's feel good
Cause homies like to feel that wet up and down
And ladies like to feel it deep round and round
And just to put this bomb ass track in context
Everybody with me if you like sex

OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE
OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE

And nothing like liquid love between the sheets
And if your not a virgin then you'll agree

[Verse 1]
She used to love him, he used to love her
She used to kiss him, he used to hug her
Call it deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school
Now there's no flame, things ain't the same
Looks like she changed, thinks it's some game
He's left in the rain trying to point blame, took for a fool
She moved on quick, he still lovesick
She's not having it, thinks he's some prick
He don’t believe it, wants it just the how it was in school
He keeps callin' night or mornin'
Break of evenin', break of dawnin'
He keeps ringing up, she keeps hanging up, oh, what a fool
She is the best friend of the ex-girlfriend of her old school friend
Who is the close friend of this best friend
Best friend likes this boy called Blue
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him
But the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend likes him too
So the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend
Sits with best friend who by now has slept with Blue
Now the ex-girlfriend don’t want to pretend
That she ain't slept with that boy Blue
'Cause he was a friend of her ex-man too

What's all this love ting talk?
Holding hands everywhere that you walk?
She turned you bocat and now you lick toes
And she's not faithful, everybody knows
She keeps saying that she loves you
What made you think that was true?
Just let a baiders walk through
I guarantee that'll be the end of you, look
True say that girl's the boom ting, man
But she's trouble, she'll make your head spin, man
Slow down back off the love ting, man
You don't wanna be left hurtin', man
Cut the sweet talk, it ain't workin', man
And move on, she's already blurted, man

317,Hey Lover,"[Intro: Michael McCary]
I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers, I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him five months (That's right)
Besides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Catchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still, he can't stop me from having daydreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the aisle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love, we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Together we swim until the point of no control, but
It's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than...

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it

Let that man get past

How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard

When they reminisce over you, my God

I've been torn apart and faded...
And left out in the cold
When all this time I've taken advantage of everything
I've been chasing a dream
Feeling the breeze
I wish I could change it all tonight

The weakest design will fall;
The strong winds will carry on

All alone I waited for the sunlight to clear the storm
For a moment, the light was breaking
And like clockwork, it was gone
All along it was tainted; I wish this was never so
I'm chasing a dream
Feeling the breeze
I wish I could take you home tonight

The weakest design will fall;
The strong winds will carry on
Why does it stay so somber?
We almost had it all...

Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back

It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

323,Diggin' On You,"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
I was like peace in a groove
On a Sunday afternoon
You were there, so was I
In the park, 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thing for me
Finest thing you'd ever seen

[Pre-Chorus]
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two
Although for some apparent reason
Monkey lines are now in season
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on, so I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
I was like deep in a cool
What'nt gon' be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there
Could've been like anywhere
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate
In no silly conversations
Ain't no time for new relation-ships

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I must admit to you, when I heard the lines you threw
Although it usually turns me off
But this time you have turned me on
Lights off, lights on
I guess the groove is on and I am

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

[Bridge: Chilli (T-Boz)]
Oh why do I feel the way I do? (Diggin', diggin', diggin' on you)
When all I can think about is you
What was it in a line, that made me fall for you?
Do you know, why I'm diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you?

Diggin' the scene
It's on like that
Diggin', diggin', diggin', diggin' on you
And I am diggin' the scene

[Chorus]
Diggin' the scene, diggin' on you, diggin' on me
Baby baby-ooo-baby, baby
It's on like that, it's on like that
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that

You and I alone on our own
As we gon' to the top of the mountain by the water fountain gettin' it on
And we ain't leaving till the early break of morn
Because it's all about my baby doll and me
From the bottom of the barrel, to the top and it don't stop

Because a brother like me known to make that secret blast

Let your soul be your pilot
Let your soul guide you
He'll guide you well

[Verse 1]
When you're down and they're counting
When your secrets all found out
When your troubles take to mounting
When the map you have leads you to doubt
When there's no information
And the compass turns to nowhere that you know well

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
When the doctors failed to heal you
When no medicine chest can make you well
When no counsel leads to comfort
When there are no more lies they can tell
No more useless information
And the compass spins
The compass spins between heaven and hell

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And your eyes turn towards the window pane
To the lights upon the hill
The distance seems so strange to you now
And the dark room seems so still

[Verse 3]
Let your pain be my sorrow
Let your tears be my tears too
Let your courage be my model
That the north you find will be true
When there's no information
And the compass turns to nowhere that you know well

Let your soul guide you upon your way",Sting,1996,"[97, 86, 86, 87, 87]",5

Outside I see the rain is fallin', whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
But the rain will hide my cryin', cryin', cryin'
And you...

[Pre-Chorus 1:Allure]
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

[Chorus 1:Allure]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

[112]
(Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)

[Verse 2:Slim, (112), & Allure]
Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) Oh, yeah
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

[Pre-Chorus 2:Allure & Slim]
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Tears will cause an inferno baby
Romance often fades why should I take the blame?
Why should... why should I?
You were the one who left me neglected
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Chorus 2:Allure & 112]
I...
I gave you all of me (I gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)

328,You Remind Me Of Something,"Well the glory goes to those
Who do not seek it
Reveling in midnight clothes
Among the wicked
Picking scabs from off their skin
And rolling holy deeply in
To the rhythm called the song
That does not end
You remind me of something
A song that I am and you
Sing me back into myself
When I wake, when I'm sleeping
The song is a man and a woman
And everything else
And my mother is a good one
As they go
She does not condone the actions
That I do that she don't know
She swears nightly before resting
That I give her soul a testing
When I sing this song
That does not end
You remind me of something
A song that I am and you
Sing me back into myself
When I wake, when I'm sleeping
The song is a man and a woman
And everything else
It's been years since I found it
I still go where it pounded
My ears pressed to the chest
Of that one womans of song
She adores me, she ignores me
And I revel on
In wonder at something
So sweet and so long
I like the places where the night
Does not mean an end
Where smiles break free
And surpirse is your friend
And dancging goes on in the kitchen
Until dawn
To my favorite song
That has no end
You remind me of something
A song that I am and you
And you sing me back into myself
When I wake, when I'm sleeping

Rather, just fall asleep in my eyes

I will always remember you
How do I live after losing you I can't do that
You are always inside my heart~

As I sit, think back to all the times we had
Sentimental things, they bring
They make me think of all you said
Never lettin' go, you're always on my mine
Ever since that day you went away
Now I'm crying everyday I'm seeing visions of your love
As you watch from heaven up above I know you're shining down I wish you werearound but you've gone away to a place where someday you and I will meet eachother, and forever
I pray that we'll always be together
You couldn't even sleep alone because you said that it was scary without me
Your tender heart will probably be hurt
Can I not go with you
Watching you, who can not fall asleep from the pain
I pray so that you can open your eyes tomorrow morning for just one more day
It's going to be so cold there It's going to be hard alone
Bear with it a little Bear with it a little longer and I'll go

I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]

Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and

The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing

""Admit if, you bit it, bit it""

[Verse 1 - 50 Cent]
You can be a ridah and ride, or a coward and hide
Either way you go against me, you still gon die
I got four macs, a few nines, I'm ready for beef
You wanna talk, it ain't about money, then let it be brief
I need a drop for when it's a hot, a Hummer for when it's cold
An ill attorney's in my corner when these fake niggas fold
The shit I kick fuck with niggas mentally, makes them wanna mention me
And see me doing a quarter century in the penitentiary
Nastradamus predicted 50's the future, that's a fact money
I run up on your workers with the mac, like where that pack money
I'm a tell ya'll what Papi told me
I got what you need, 19,5 a key
I stay catching a stunt, frontin' in somethin' mean
And I'll clap any nigga for the right amount of cream
Run up on them all with the same problem solver
Beat up ass, tape on the handle, trey eight revolver. What!

[Hook]
Projects too hot, niggas better hope we never hit rock
Cause then we gonna run up in your spot
Screamin' get the fuck on the floor, give us the raw
(Repeat)

[Verse 2 - Nature]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I'm like Sugar Shane Mosley, it ain't no beef
You're staring, a ticket holder that sits in row three
Next to Ron Artest and Kobe
Yo I woulda went pro too, then I let them phillies slow me
I'm like a black man's asthma, seeking a pump
Breathin' deeper when I'm creeping up
Ya'll need to fuck with the tightest, I stick niggas
Encephalitis leavin' whole families in silence
My virus is obvious, past on to most rap fiends
Un cured, ain't no vaccine
Last seen at the automatic teller machine, maxing out
Or in the studio booth, blacking out
It's Con Air style, real twisted, I disappear on some Blair Witch shit
Comin' back I'm rich kid
Either or, you can't stop me with my feet in the door
Or walk away from the street or the morgue, play your part nigga

[Hook - Last line cut off]

""Niggas bit off Nas"" - Ghostface Killah
""Admit it, you bit it"" - G. Dep
""Tell these niggas somethin' God"" - Ghostface Killah

[Verse 3 - Nas]
What, yo
I disturb niggas and white boys, with five pointed stars
Tatted on they arms, pimp your moms, like I'm Magic Don Juan
From Queens to Hong Kong, weed in the bong
We smoke that, leave our minks on the coat rack
Those that plot on me, nine times outta ten the nine is on me
Feds search the God, but nothin' they find on me
When I rap don't wait to clap applaud sooner
Unless you hate a nigga like George Bush Jr., I bring war quick to you
Porsche maneuvers through the city like New York sewers
Stinkin' up the air, Central Park, horse manure
Rims is 22 inches, Benz suspensions
22 inch dick when I'm pimpin'
Impotent you niggas get me sick, wanna be soundin' like
You knowin' my arithmetic, but we don't sound alike
50 Cent with Braveheart-ed, we ride to the grave depart us
You fake niggas imitate what I started, let's go

But you thought of me in your time of need, so I say

Build me a road, dear, and I will come runnin'
No matter how long or how hard it may be (Where ever you are)
I have the light from your love, dear, to guide me

You get buried by the past
Give me just a little taste
Lay this mask to waste
Take me home

My mind is racing take me home
My body's aching so alone
I'll make you wanna stay with me
Befriended by the enemy
One more time

Every little thing about this tells me
Nothing out there is ever gonna help me
All these words that I hear spoken
Just promises broken

Lookin' outside from a window sill
Throw another coin in my wishin' well
Never find what you're lookin' for
15 miles
Your dim light shines from so far away
Your sad smile is all I see
When I say...

Every little thing about this tells me
Nothing out there is ever gonna help me
And all these words that I hear spoken
Just promises broken

From the hotel satellite
Don't look like you're living right
Here's a deal you can't refuse
You ain't got as much to lose

Can you tell your troubles to

Hope a part of you will stay

There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine...
Aimed at your average teen

How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby

What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?

Y'all think B. Dot fire, right?
Well, I guess that's what them likes get you
You know this battle is kinda like the building
The heat is on and you 'bout to have some serious Mike (mic) issues!
What, y'all think I can't freestyle for nothin'?
Boy, I'm wild seasoned
Geechi battled just now, I start a TEC (Tech), half the crowd leavin'
No time wastin'
Though this a waste of time, I figured I'd shake up with the best
This is ""disrespected"" versus ""can't seem to get respected""
And well, that's a problem I need to take up with the rest
Until then, I'm in Cali, shiieeet, I took a- pay cut just to flex
Parallel universe, you believe in it?
You here to try to Trump a white man and I'm here to Wake Up Mr. West
It all starts, with a Glock spittin'
Iron, Mike versus the Vegas, the kid like 'Pac did it
Born Legacy Supreme, R Streetz
'Cause by the third went Top missin'
We two different elements, separated
And Kemetics, is where the plot thickens
So excuse my punctuation, mark
You half-assed; semi colon
Pause, that's for people thinkin' Dot different
Nah, are you progressin' or talkin', you either build or boast
Aye, I (AI) flew to West World, Bernard told me to kill the host
With steel lines, to heat up a square, he a radiator
Fuck a knife fight, we ain't joustin'
What I blew (blue) knock red off his pedestal: American Gladiators
I've seen people tougher than you, and you ain't built like ours
You lack Courage, dawg (dog), and I use this (Eustace) bag just to kill a coward
Your queen? As beautiful as a rose, and I love pickin' flowers
That box, the most exciting place to bust (bus) and drop in: Tilted Towers!
Fortnite bars!
B. Dot what you gon' do wit' me?
I'm meal toting, max shield potions, holdin' two 50's
BAOW, that's what he get for bringin' me the drama
Cheapskate, shitty teammate, he ain't see the Llama
Bro you too paranoid so I doubt your performance
All you gon' do is cry, nothin' but a clown we recordin'
Whatchu gon' talk about? My suicide?
Bro, that sound get aborted like, ""What you knew Blood?""
I drew Blood without the extortion
Fuck a B. Dot, I'll murder the whole Left Side Connection
Buck-50, he gon' need his whole left side connected
I booked your funeral soon as I booked my Airbnb
The knife I got, IHOP, it go from P to B!
Or the Desert E, fire into this queer chin
He took every single round, y'all know I can't get a clear win
Fear him? Boy, I played Suge since I had a shot drawn
Now it's a shot drawn, I'm in front of your house, now it's your door gettin' knocked on
Versus EK, it looked like Smack you was about to pop on
But we copped the pay-per-view
Just watch the battle live...Dot calm (.com)!
Get tossed, somethin' without the pen
But fuck a credit scheme, let it scream
Back of the whip, you playin' Kennedy
I clown on you, aim down on you, I'm in a mezzanine

I crack a bottle on Blood head, I'm spillin' Grenadine
I'm just comparin' Kemetic Science to kinetic energy
I'll weave, put Dot to sleep, he'll need pajama pants
The only dude annoying to Mike would be Banana Man
If it's work involved, I'll search for Charles, that's an anagram
I'll stomp your Cali ass the fuck out, you'll get the Hammer Dance
I didn't have much room to do the Hammer Dance but, keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
You here to act like you still a boss and battle me
I'm here to put some life into your false reality

New York, we done studied the game tapes and we see why y'all bang late

Because initially, mentally we not in the same state
See out east, you told Suge he was the biggest known slob since Biz and Owens
Blood is you dumb?
Do you know where you at?
Do you know where I'm from?
Didn't you say ""Fuck the West""?
Then called a triple OG that started Westside Ps a ""slob"", wow the disrespect
The irony, I wanna Just Do It but then I know I won't get the check
Respect the west
What the fuck you know about gangbangin'?
White boy from New York, middle class maintainin'
My niggas really in the field, the only shit you kill is Call Of Duty game playin'
Callin' out Brizz and Roc, like you top tier main stagin'
This neanderthal only want to battle y'all to show who's really Cave Gangin'
I came sprayin'
Haters gon' say it's Photoshop when I come through with more machinery than Robocop
They'll take your bitch for ransom, you gon' have to put money on your heart like them weak ass clothes you rock
The flow don't stop
Think Pacquiao when I pack him out, givin' him the same treatment Cotto got
Or flash with the cannon (Canon), you here standin' next to me brings a whole new meanin' to photo op'
The fo' fo' cocked, and I'm shootin' big bullets, it'll feel like a boulder block
And some guys only about that thing, and when it sing, you better duck like you know the wop
You know this Dot, I'm only here to address you Mike
""You had a lot to say about a league you said yes to twice.""
That's that slave mentality
Thinkin' I say ""yes"" to a league ain't gon' sway or rattle me
Nigga I say ""yes"" for the west, show some respect, if I ain't accept this there ain't no way we battling
Thanks for travelling
We heard the hype just figured you for the nervous type
Thought I had a different opponent til I noticed they subbed you in the game and had you throw on a jersey, Mike
Well this gon' be American History, X-cept we gon' change the script and word it tight
Give you the curb to bite
Rest in peace Emmett Till
We'll tie this white bitch to the front of the whip, I'm reversin' life
You gon' reimburse them, right?
I mean they paid for the flight I'm sure the purse was nice
You was racin', they told you ""be patient"" but they didn't explain you was goin' under the surgeon's knife
You suburban white, and write like you live some sort of urban life
From New York, all the way to L.A., do it BIG, well that's just gon' get your Suburban striked
I'm in an urge to fight, they done put a real life in front of the poltergeist
So I'm checkin' you with the one, two like I think it's a broken mic
I get up close to strike, poke him twice, razor sharp Logan knife
With that over right then it's, ""Oh goodnight.""
White boys always wanna wrestle, til somethin' open they chest like Hogan hype
You better hold on Mike, you the mom that's driftin' here with the paradigm shiftin'
On URL, where all the stars are at the top of the mountain, actin'
Paramount Pictures, KG, where is my digits?
After this we gon' talk bro'
This will be the last time you get me for the cost low
I figured they'd put me in front of the wigger cause they gettin' somethin' big for the cheap price and he used to workin' at Costco
My fault though, for tryin' to help you Mike
You said I wanted more money for this battle, well you right
Was tryin' to get you more money too, but that's what they not gon' tell you Mike
You're so connected to URL
You think you're free but can't see how they handheld you Mike
No Henny bottle but they treat you like canned goods the way they shelf you Mike
I see you're not gelled too tight
All kind of cracks in the guy cranium
I mean, what kind of (Wakanda) shit is this?
Smack is T'challa sendin' a white agent to the sky to stop Killmonger from passin' the Vibranium
Ain't no savin' him, Smack I'll drop another third round, don't make me go there
I find it Strange, you can't create fire rounds but get to jumpin' in my world outta nowhere
This is no fair, y'all done stuffed dynamite inside of the wheel barrel
And rode in front of battle raps Will Farrell
All this jokin' and fuckin' around, and still can't make it baby, you should feel sterile
Why air you? I'm not here to let a gun go blam
I'd rather pull out, pistol whip him in the mouth
You know, smack his lips like Twork when his punch don't land
I got a hunch though fam', you gon' be like my last competition
I'm used to the opposition and hit the fans with the proposition
Like, ""B. Dot is street and he conscious. And that's conflictin'"", a sick disposition
Now I just fuse my future with my past
He once tried to decide on a half, that ain't gon' help you get no split decision
This for my Crips in prison and all my Bloods behind the walls in the wicked system that don't fit this description
Yeah you know this Matrix hates us
All these codes I'm tryin' to Control/Alt/Delete and shift encryptions
Even your team's indifferent
I talked to Mickey on the phone he was like, ""Dot I don't know. You got superlative raps
But Mike's pen's gettin' better. He could Trump you.""
I say, ""Well that's fake news. The wrong alternative facts.""
And besides, Mickey gon' be turnin' his back the same way he did with Joe Budden
Watchin' his homie gettin' punched on and looked away like he don't know nothin'
Y'all hoes frontin'
Yellow Tape Gang, which one of y'all gon' throw fists and clap?
Nigga, Bonnie Godiva's the only G from your Unit we've ever seen go get the strap
You better roll a clip back
This that black African power
And if these was your last days Mikey, this is your last hour

[Round 2: Mike P]
I thought to touch on your Kemetic Science but my mind was stressed so I diverted
More to pure shit, and tell that every line complex, a wordsmith
To this herb shit, there is nothin' that this guy can test
And if his people wanna jump in, I'm splittin' Dot Mobb in half; Shine vs Rex
Let's turn up
Flame life, I'll put the heat on ops
Use your pussy white angles, Mike P no cop
Get K.O.'d you wouldn't see those shots
A fist to lame, it's Twister game, so when son hit the floor, hands and feet on Dot
I've been the nicest
Long before Thanos I've been a Titan
Spine shot, he start convulsin', that's meningitis
Brush me wrong, it's a Scope in your mouth, that's gingivitis
Shoulder shot, he can't lift an arm up, that's tendinitis
I said I ride with a pocket pistol, miniature, but I like the hammer
It's small, but does the job cause it's the little things in life that matters
I snuck it in the venue, they ask how the GP did it
It's easy to sneak a pistol in if it's 3D printed
I flew here, for a tag, puttin' you up in a grave
DNA, with the piece, I can maneuver with a K
Home court what?
Bitch you ain't know what I would do up in this place
Corky Romano, you here for a white bag but it blew up in your face
Oh you fire in L.A., but let's be honest, you don't stack bars
Canada vs Verb, boy you barley even scratched god
You terrible at road trips, wack god
You hate to camp so when you cook you only comfortable makin' fires in your backyard
How dare you test the pen, like you do it better
The white skin peel in L.A. I ain't used to the weather
For a band, I'll pop punks in Cali without Rufio
You shit on the tree and URL, but never gave yourself room to grow
You diva, vs Mike I'm Tyson, with what I do to hoes
Bullets Caillou, bald heads goin' through your clothes
I'm evil Ryu, no remorse for what I do to souls
And if I try you, I'm puttin' ten on your back like a [?]
Silly wit' that
If I Reed Dollaz I get silly wit' cats
Two rounds is all I need, I Surf verse Nitty a cat
The bulldog bitin' and I don't give a shit if he strapped
Soon as he feels the nips he (Nipsey) Hustle
But I turn back around for a victory lap
You wanna argue URL? Fine, let's talk holmes
Issues I had, I hashed out wit' 'em, not cried and throwed stones
And any argument, can end wit' a knife
So point chrome, cause even if I lose this debate, I still drive the point home
Be honest, thank me for doin' this in the west for you
I could've extra killed you in New York, but I want the best of you
I took the disadvantage, cause I ain't scared like the rest of you
Nobody said ""yes"" to you, pussy I requested you!
And the fact that you here right now, I've lost respect for you
But I guess it's ""Fuck URL"" til URL throws some checks to you
Time

[Round 2: B. Dot]
They say Mike P punch crazy, CRAZY, Mike
The dopest white battle rapper on Smack
How is that?
You not even the dopest white battle rapper in your camp
I mean it's quite apparent that you ain't fuckin' with Aaron
And white battle rap that's such a small space to be sharin'
It's gettin' over crowded but you allowed it
Can't put your trust in connivers
Jealous Ones Envy, especially when you see them on the road to success
And that's a car you was just in (Justin), Driver
Now you the hitchhiker searchin' for the newest road
You blew it bro
White Battle Rapper On Smack was your own little world
And we stopped watchin' your Truman Show to view Glue' and Joe
But I brought the coolest scope
These fans deserve a brand new optic
I'm here to widen the lens and zoom in on the microscopic to show y'all how Mike views profit (Prophet)
We all watched it, as you came in this game and changed lanes cause you had a few options
It was either Smack/URL or you could've been King Of The Dot'in'
Which one will get the views poppin'?
You first made the news when dude socked him, dropped him
Boo bopped, clocked him
And that was the first time you had a few dudes watchin'
That's when that short fuse popped in
Your Ascension in the game when dude took flight
I mean you took takin' punchin', in a battle, to whole new heights
But I can't understand you Mike
Cause fuck a contractual obligation
Let somebody snuff me, I'ma pop you, that's an actual confirmation
And I ain't makin' up with nobody in these battle situations
I mean you, plus a body bag will be the only thing y'all add in my Math-ematical equation
But I get the evaluation
You vs Tink The Demon was hot, but see I dug a lil' deeper
Looked down in the grave and I seen through the plot
This wigger write like he fight for civil rights, Mike, we all agree that you not
Just cause you Rose a little bit don't mean that you can Park here and not relinquish your spot
I mean, why not fight with ICE?
Try to kill the Wolf in a small corridor like Leonidas when he was [?]
Maybe it's cause you know if you went up north to the cold you'd get exposed
As just another flake that blends in with the snow over at King Of The Dot
And we see this a lot
White boys wanna ball with the blacks
We go hard in the paint, they never seen on the block
This is our lane
We draw the attention and only dish it to wiggers when we needin' a shot
But believe it or not
If you go over there with 'Ganik you'd do damage
And you know this, right?
But see it's all part of his gang, he claim he wanna stick to his Genesis
Play Station'ed in his slot where he can be this token white
Keep focus sight
You gotta see through the bloggin', Facebook lies and how he markets it
I got foresight to see through Fort Nite and now you put up a shield and build
Fortifications to hide behind and not get your target hit
It's obvious, your demo is in the graphics
That's how you grow audience?
Well where we from this system don't work for us
That's why we blow cartridges
The awkwardness, all fusin' to a dude that use video game schemes and make y'all applaud the shit?
But y'all wouldn't accept that from a nigga like Dre Vishiss or Geechi Gotti, some of the hardest Crips
But you was able to hit Tink wit', everything on the move list
That Hadouken!
That you did!
Only got approved when
We gave you a pass and didn't laugh at the bullshit
'Cause of your skin
And you knew this
And I'm just gettin' it all of my chest like a nudist
I thought I figured out these squares
It appears I'm still havin' trouble with the Rubix
So the tool is
Makin' arrangements to blossom his top like a tulip
Pussy nigga, two lips
The heat will make him cool it
You can catch a blue flame, that's that Crip and that Piru shit!
You're foolish, thinkin' I'ma just let you walk into hip hop
See the goal he has is to stand in front of the net, upload a clip
If it's funny or controversial his shit pop
And what we do? Give him a Lil' Pump, some aahs, a Lil' Uzi Vert to the tip top
Got these pussies suckin' they own dick in the race to get to 69 position
Well, this is that pit stop
Get your shit clocked
More niggas flamed up than what the Dips got
Big Dot, soon as I went viral, there was a two year big stop
URL contract, sign that, shit nah
New slaves, but I know how to evade the slipknot
Hitchcock, put him in the Twilight, fif' cocked
Silencer on it, the shit'll sound like a rim shot
Who hot? Him not
Grown man? Kid not
Barrel pointed at an undercover cop like, ""You killed Big Pop""
Gridlocked, what make you think you can beat me?
My nigga, I studied etymology, and honestly
I know your last name is pronounced ""Poo-lee-see"" and I digged deeply
Do the research like I'm supposed to
In Italian, ""Pulice"" means ""something small and annoying""
Well, what a fitting name for what he means to this culture
And y'all chose to, put the updated PCs in front of the archive
Not smart, guys
So when I separate 'em, think segregation, ropes around each wrist, we pull 'em apart tied (apartheid)
This the dark side
Nah, I ain't Brizz but it's gon' be a Raw deal when the fif' flyin'
Send half the clip at your clique, have your men dyin'
And send you eight (insinuate) for anything you was implyin'
You gon' die tryin'
This that Black African Power
And if these was your last days, Mikey, this is yo' last hour

[Round 3: Mike P]
I said, you know what? L.A., this ain't even about competition
Look, y'all, he's charged with fallin' in love with the URL system
Think of this as a filmed inquisition
I'm 'bout to give y'all a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics your deposition
True or false: LA been runnin' battle rap?
True or false? Y'all been lined with some killers
And every year, URL throws an event around this time for the realest
Danny, Diz, Nitty, Geechi, EK: these fuckin' guys are gorillas
Puts in all the damn work without cryin' a river
Now, hear me out, cause he got the feelin' he a side piece, he insecure
Convinced that he's missin' out on a ride, sweet
He Drake new album, and this goes way beyond rhymes deep
Cause A: he raps great, but you turn a little soft when you start to side B
Dot! Find peace
Cause a lot of great writers like you done came and went
The more you show your cards, the more give them different ways to vent
Like your contradictions
And we gon' touch on all those mind games you pitch
Like how you don't care about battle rap, but you cared that you weren't the main event
Main event?
Bro, co-main event, I wouldn't hand you that
You said you cared about music more but you couldn't even handle that
My first song in five years, SMOKED YOU, you couldn't even handle tracks
Dawg, how you from LA (*chk-chk*) and you couldn't even handle Wax
Don't even answer that
Address the switch in your steez in that third round vs EK when you shit on the league
I do not get what it means
How you were shittin' on Beas' for puttin' Diz on the stage but you got Diz on your team
But ooooh
FACTS
Let's just ignore that from the pseudo-righteous race-baiter
Besides, it was a haymaker
We felt that shit a day later
Even though it was bullshit lies while he was starin' y'all down
Cause he a jealous ass rapper that likes to pander to crowds
Let's get to panderin' now
Grippin', I'm eyein' somethin' crazy
He froze up, I rose up, you'll be lyin' in the daisies
The tiny little snub nose, got him flyin' to the gate
He, thought he was incredible, too (Incredible 2), 'til he saw the kid firin' (fire in) the baby
I see right through all the bullshit that this cat scan
Colt .45 and I use it, as a back hand
There's levels to this maze of a game, so let the gat blam
I'll ghost 'em, 'til he blue
'Cause what's a Dot compared to what I pack? Man! (Pac-Man)
I heard of his troops, there's birds to recoup
Got in the Benz, drive it and park
I peeked in his house, then seen him get out
Dot on the ledge, got out the car
I'm turnin' to Mook if I'm yearnin' to shoot
Plot on his death, shot on this mark
Gun to his head, then one in his chest
Dot on his head, dot on his heart!
What UP!? What up!?
I said, I'm gettin' at him
For your rhymes, I'm airin' at a mark
Donald Trump: the .45 splittin' families apart
Fuck this guy dumpin', if Dot want it, the blade Tony Hawk
Six buck fifties, cause I'll spin 'em into a 900
So keep comin' with that lost mentality
Your ignorance is leadin' to your loss in salary
YOU here to act like a boss and battle me
I'M here to put some life into your false reality

[Round 3: B. Dot]
I wanna share somethin' wit' you Mikey, I'm not sure if you remember this
It was back in the day when we would exchange, you know, have our little differences
You DM'd me an apology, that was man of you, but it was interestin' how you ended it
""Oh you fake Lux you wrong for bringin' the DM up.""
Nah nigga he was wrong for sendin' it
But let's get into it
We gon' skip right to the end
Where you say, ""As one of the good Europeans, it's hard to not to instinctively defend.""
Now, European instinct, that's what I wanna talk about
The first two rounds was the head shot, this the autopsy after we chalk him out
Let me walk you out
So there's no confusion about evolution
We migrated out of Africa up into Europe, I'm talkin' archaic humans
Used to the humid, 'til we get caught in the cold,  grey skies
UV rays couldn't get through them
In order to receive vitamin D that was heaven sent we lost melanin and turned into mutants
And that biology, fucks wit' your psychology
Appearance started to change and the mind gets caught up in rage
Dirty Europeans, until my ancestors the Moors went up into Spain and Italy and taught 'em to bath
Just flip through the page, this is history
This ain't facts I gotta spit, now look at you
Another dirty European gettin' washed up by an African again
I don't battle rap to win, I'm here to contend with the ancestry from which you descend
Them Greeks that came over to speak on my people
Called us ""Ethiots"" which meant ""burnt skin""
And y'all want some type of utopia
Well, I want revenge for Ethiopia
The only un-colonized country on the continent, that's why your Italian ancestors bombed the shit
And I'm astonished wit', the fact that blacks don't see we been beefin' with Italians since that Hannibal/Carthage shit
So it's that mobster hit
Dome shot to the back of the head, face first in a pasta dish
You make me sick
The fuck did you do to beat me when you a descendant of Mussolini?
Drugs? You use 'em freely
I highly doubt we can go that route
Every cell I see got brothers doin' years for grams of kiwi
Y'all peep me?
Haile Selassie, I know you prolly ain't catch it
But I practice ancestor worship, I'm just invokin' the spirit
I'm 'bout to hold up this mirror
I want to see yourself through a scientific perspective
Your genetics? Recessive
And that's what lead to the depression durin' your early adolescence
You're tellin' Suge, ""My depression had to do with my pops.""
You slit your wrists and got me up here killin' time, I guess we both on suicide watch
What should I do to my op'?
Let the heater fly? Nah, I'd rather slit your wrist
Put another white bitch in the tub, let him bleed and die
Me and 12 other niggas you battled can be the 13 Reasons Why
Aye, my nigga, we can't slice no even pie
You make a hit, run base get home safe, don't even slide
We hit and miss, that's three strikes, get life without even cryin'
You don't see this crime?
All these obstacles, you never got accustomed to the cops accosting you
Constantly, to the point you wanna take off the black skin like it's a costumed suit
What was so hard for you?
Couldn't meet daddy's expectations of graduation from them Harvard schools?
Pops was hard on you
So you went psychotic, turn to narcotics, sniffin' lines, pill pop and shoot just to get him off of you
You lost your screws
Thoughts confused
Ever since daddy left you've been alone and suicide been in the dome
You do all this bloggin', then wanna hide behind madness and use drugs, but when in Rome
We can't skip the tone
Yeah you rap black but still act Vic Damone
Mike my words can never hurt you
But you an addict and you know what they say about sticks and stones
Let's switch the mold
I'm not even from New York, but I know the history of the mafia that put
Drugs in the black communities that fuck nigga's mamas up and put nigga's pops in cuffs
Didn't want to sell to your own communities so y'all cut deals with black drug dealers to get the profits up
I can take you on a crash course on how they dump drugs in LA and came back around with the armor trucks
Put us on smack to kill us, now you on Smack gettin' killed
Nigga, karma sucks
But, be honest brah, would you swap wit' us?
Would you trade your life Mike and give up your white rights?
To be reincarnated as a young black durin' the crack era of the '80s when the crime spiked
It was beyond trife
They gave us guns and drugs in the dark, but in hindsight
What an evil genius, to make us move weight like limestone and put us all under that limelight
Now, would you trade your life Mike, to be a young black always under suspiscion
Get arrest cause you fit the description
Three years in prison never given a sentence
Solitary confinement, gettin' beat by the C.O.'s and the inmates, and all you do is defend it?
Til you finally release cause they couldn't provide evidence or give' em a witness
Are y'all seein' the difference?
Between your suicidal admittance you spit in your writtens
And a brother like Kalief Browder who needed relief, but couldn't get it 'cause the tone of his pigment
So suicide was committed
I don't condone it, but I get it
Here's a way for you to relate:
Think of a game where the whole system is against you, but you can't remotely control it
You've been chosen for moments
Your childhood trauma you went through you want this culture to notice is bogus
You sold weight on the corners, copped some piff, wasn't ""stop and frisk"" 'cause a white boy like you would never be noticed
You from Long Island, complainin' cause your pops was controllin'
He was on Riker's Island, detained him cause a backpack was stolen
I'm just exposin' the motives
White men lack resources so they go around stealin' wealth
Genocide, then when all men have died, he turn the gun around and kill himself
How destructive of you
And you wanna bring all of that into battle rap, how fucked up is you?
Man this culture needs substance from a brother, like me not substance abuse
I don't fuck wit' you dudes
I got no empathy for white male misery, somethin' gotta give
Rich whites wanna kill they selves, poor black just wanna live
This shit is sick
If you ask me, battle rap deserves a better switch
Like you should've died when you slit your wrists, Young B should've been never hit
You are evidence that white rappers are guests in hip-hop, never residents
Don't insult my intelligence
Claimin' you culturally relevant cause your suicidal embellishment
I've been negligent, but now I'm back to cast out demons like the Exorcist
The black man is god Mikey, and as always, the white man remains devilish
This western shit
And this that black African power
And if these was yo' last days Mikey, this was your last hour",URLtv,1996,"[77, 66, 61, 64, 56, 56, 56, 56, 67, 70]",10

[Verse 2]
It's the E comin' up from the gank
So nigga let me ride all the way to the bank
Coz ain't nuthin' on my mind but them chips
Gotta have a griff, run a nigga dip
Back to the past on the Compton streetz
Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin' mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front 'n back, dippin' side to side
And it's been like that since I was BG
""It's the E,"" that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin' that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin' done like a two dollar ho
It's just a lil something from the E tah let U know...

[Verse 3]
It's still the C-P-T, nuthin' more, nuthin' less
On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Coz them busta-ass niggas can't see what I'm sayin'
They think the E be playin' [What ?]
But I ain't givin' up nuthin' but this Glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin'
With the original Compton criminal
Coz the only thing poppin' is a snaps
And ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
But a nigga like the E ain't trippin' though
I'm just here tah let U niggas know...

Baby, I just gotta be free to be me, oh
Baby, I just gotta be free to be me

That's how it is so that's how I'll leave, I'm free

350,Get Together,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Love is but a song we sing
Fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

[Chorus]
Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now

[Verse 2]
Some may come and some may go
We will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

Come on people now
Smile on your brother

If you hear the song I sing
You will understand (listen!)
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your command

Come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another
Right now

Come on people now

351,Carnival,"[Intro: Białas & Quebonafide]
Ten człowiek gada z mikrofonem, on jest kurwa jakiś chory
Wafle ryżowe i masło orzechowe
Tak się żyje, tak się żyje, tak się żyje

Improwizujemy, uśmiech i ból
Pasujemy wszędzie, tylko nie tu

Bij brawo głośniej, bij brawo głośniej
Improwizujemy, uśmiech i ból
Pasujemy wszędzie, tylko nie tu

Bij brawo głośniej, bij brawo głośniej

[Zwrotka 1: Quebonafide]
Mój rap jest w modzie
Jeszcze sobie troche pokrzyczy
Z masowej niszy sztucznie wybici
A mogłem pogrzebać nadzieję
I cały ten fejm ograniczyć do grobowej ciszy
To mi nie było pisane, to stanie na czele i gra pod publikę
Od Początku to mi nie było pisane
Dlatego dzisiaj stoję za akapitem
Mało mnie widać, pokaźne skillsy
Nie widzę się przy raperach, uf
Wiec jeśli chcesz mi cokolwiek zarzucić
Czysty Mystique, zamieniam się w słuch
Quebonafide idę za złym przykładem
Rap dał mi władzę i się czuję jak król
Skoncentrowany już tylko na sobie
Więc powiedz mi, czemu skupiam ich uwagę

[Interlude: Quebonafide]
Życie jak teatr mnie rzuca na deski
Bez zbędnych scen, bez zbędnych scen, bez zbędnych scen
Mimo, że teraz już się jąkam od tej groteski
(Jednym tchem, jednym tchem...)
Jednym tchem!

[Zwrotka 2: Quebonafide]
Zepsuło mnie to do szpiku kości
Rzucone jest rzucone, wyższa ortopedia
Nie słyszę nic oprócz krzyku i prośby
Ledwo żywy bo wykańcza mnie deadline
Znasz mój kawał o sławie?
Goniła mnie aż ją złapałem
Uznaje to za nic nie warte wciąż
Ale zawsze to jakieś uznanie
Dalej przekazują mnie z rąk do rąk
Fale radiowe każą mi windsurfować
Nie poznaje się już w odróżnieniu od mord
Na mieście i samochodach
Zaprowadź mnie na backstage
Albo gdzieś gdzie odetchnę
Ten fejm, stres, mniej więcej
Bo nie chce brać modelu życia
Który ma wzięcie

Ty, to jednak ten mikrofon gada do niego
A może... może to ja jestem popierdolony?!

Od dawna słuchają tych ksyw
To im je dam w rytmie przyspieszeń na prowo

I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup, hey yeah

Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it, gotta leave it all behind now

Unaware but underlined
I figured out this story, it wasn't good
But in the corner of my mind I celebrated glory
But that was not to be

In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find a little room inside for me? Oh

But I ain't gonna make that call

United, we fall

Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it
Got my hands on your heart, gonna take it

I could tell a million lies
And it would come as no surprise
When the truth is like a stranger
Hits you right between the eyes

There's a time and a place and a reason
And I know I got a love to believe in
All I know, got to win this time

Bitch, I ain't got nothing but time
So I'mma get out on these cuts and grind
Keep my mind on cloud twenty-nine
My player ways keep me with plenty dimes
See I'mma shine like all six of my gold teeth
When a nigga get through cooking up this O-Z
All night on the block 'til the sun rise
My only friend is a Glock with the 4-5
Four, five in the mornin', it don't stop
Daydreamin' 'bout flossin' a drop top (woop)
Blue lights snap me back to reality
I hit the alley quick and toss what I got on me
Tricks ain't got shit to do but harass
Searched a nigga and took about a three in cash
I guess that's better than gettin locked up
Or gettin jammed with that shit I had rocked up, huh!

[Chorus: MJG + Eightball]
Now I heard that the South is where yo' folks from
Down in the bottoms where they broke some
Whips cross a nigga back, way back
And now they wonder why we act, how we act
Gold teeth and heavy Chevys, and talking slow
Afros and loud ass Italian clothes
People barbecuein' in the front yard
Money from the first of the month card!
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there hear me, get ya hands up
If anybody out there feel me, get ya hands up

[Verse 2: MJG]
I got a maid cooking grits with a, outfit
So tight my niggas wanna stay the whole nite
Dice game in the kitchen, nigga, T. Lee
Nigga drunk singin' sounding like the Bee Gees
Ham sam'ich in the driveway, drop top
Naked women in the den playing, hop scotch
Thirty bustas in my yard, they be, long gone
So hit me and I'mma keep my, phone on
I be out turning corners, dranking, one fifth
Got some scratches on my rims, 'cause of one dip
Met a broad yesterday, she hit me, ten times
If I diss her it'll take a nigga, ten lines
MJG standing tall and I, won't fold
You can have all the bitches, 'cause I, don't hold
On to any woman like a human handcuff
You got ya hair down, baby, fuck it, stand up!

How many flows can I compose? I drop this slang like lyrical 'bows
Stickin' out just like an OUTKAST or a thorn from stem of rose
Like nachos, the lyrics are crispy, crackin' when y'all bite
Been had a Coke and a smile, now I'm trippin off Yak & Sprite
Y'all just might see the skunk guy, with a girl who chunked thighed
Below the Mason-Dixon line, real niggas know what I'm talkin' about
From Texas, Atlanta, oh man, Alabama, Savannah
The deeper, the darker, the Dirty South is what I'm after
No laughter, the content of the rhyme may be contagious
The Space Age is pimpin this, players comin' major
They shot the sucka, sprayed ya, cut ya wife and played her
The player the B-I-G B-O-I, dope boy rhyme maker
Beats, rhymes, and layers of music right here to please you
And if you hate the Dirty, then patna, see we don't need you
You know I'm talkin 'bout?

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
You wouldn't understand, if you stood under it (ooh)
It's like the more that I talk to you, the dumber that I get
The closer that I walk to you, the further that we stand
Apart, distant
Nobody has the upper hand but my body's resistant
So now, throw your phalanges in the ground
I'm still abound, un-believers stay from hell around
I found negative niggas they only keep ya down
Transmitting from Native American burial ground
I carry around, the weight of all worlds on my shoulder pads
I'm post to blast, space invaders up somebody's dad
Serious as Aa-Bb-Cc
If knowledge be the key then buddy roasted on the porch
And wait for ya momma to get off work so she can roast yo' ass
They need to find an open window fast
Word to the motherfucker; word to the motherfucker
Word to the motherfucker!

Well-a hell, I can never catch a sweller
Cause you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me

Well yo, here's the humdinger, I'm briggity bringin a new style of lingo
It's a rap singer with the fat flow, so lo and behold
I higgity hold this mic piece for ransom
It's all about expansion, stocks of skunk, props and my pops get a mansion
By the age of 16, had dreams of big screens
Mad rubbers to keep my dick clean
Chrome tools in rent
And I only go downtown to buy jewels and tints
Jaboll, Guess, ol' Gold and sess
I check the mic 2-1 and chew gum to ease the breath
My style is wild like the Cats of Villanova
The heat on the street'll keep my 40's spillin over
So the skunk and thai keep me high when I'm smokin
And I don't sleep, just take naps with one eye open
See I believe the beaded weed in me is feedin me
The inspiration to riggity rock the nation
From white folk to Haitian, Boriqua Jamaican
Burn MC's like degrees of Mason because you're fakin
I'm on point, exclamation with the caper
The flavor misbehaver from the super duper rhyme maker

Thicker than your blunt cause yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper
And I got more spunk than that punk from Punky Brewster
Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo

I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though

Masters of the microphone, makers of the super rhymes

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, I'm down for whatever like nuttin nice

But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off

Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything

If one day you just up and leave

362,Run-Around,"Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

When the scene unfolds, young girls 13 years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin' they got rank
See SEGA ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas, trained assassins
Do search and seize, ain't knocking or asking
They're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipelines
Infernos outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future look it up, where they say it in the Constitution?
That in the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Got to deal with W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with a serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me, 'cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin to do?
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the new world order, time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or keep our ass in

Listen up, lil nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew every day
On the average 'bout four or five, I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
Now I realize the cost after I lost my best friend Bean
I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin?
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't 16 years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox, I want outta this hole
I'm in a cell under attack, loc up folks
They in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reach the planet without the black man

[Verse 4: Big Gipp]
So what's your aim? Try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home
And not wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking, no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask on the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow

Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?

My name it means nothing, my fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I possessed, now, they are gone
They are gone, they are gone...

[Verse 2]
Oh, where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped crying since you went away
You went away, you went away...

369,Fast Life,"The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams, a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fishscales from triple beams, I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley, packin' fifty calis
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos, just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's, then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen half a Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin' targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us, try to beat us, we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
The leaders, lookin' straight charmin' in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas
You gots to come get through our whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin' mad payola
Slangin' that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game, we do our thing, son

[Chorus x2]
Livin' the fast life, with fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So, we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven-figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, I got guns from Italy, smoke trees considerably
Mid-state and Green, it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery: shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo, but who's petro?
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect, though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots Holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness, shootin, catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

Brother, you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're livin' in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
[G Rap] Aiyo, our lifestyles' exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] Esquire attire, standin' on ground with one pivot
[G Rap] Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats, reclinin' like it's spacious
[G Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
[G Rap] Gamblin' Grants
[Nas] Handlin' stamps
[Duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bankrolls got the cops comin' in plain clothes
[G Rap] Tryin' to arraign the gang 'cause of our fame
That's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[G Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer
Supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P, my cliquo
Dimes look magnifico, puttin' a cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin' beats with flows
[G Rap] Aiyo, we went from standin' on blocks without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stocks and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel, we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah, so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Ihr wollt Kapitalismus mit Herz?
Fick mich, aber nicht im Etap Hotel
Sondern richtig schön mit Essen gehen
Und am nächsten Morgen noch Taxigeld
Vor der Glotze, sauer auf die scheiß Sozialschmarotzer
Anstatt auf den Chef, der mit dem Geld aus eurer Arbeit
Seiner Tochter noch 'nen Lamborghini kauft
Alter, dann verdient ihr's auch
Doch ich versteh, ihr regt euch lieber über Brangelina auf
Für's Gewissen 10 Euro spenden
Dann kommen die hoffentlich nicht über die Grenzen
Und holen sich alles zurück, vielleicht lieber doch die Waffenlieferung canceln, fleißig wie ihr seid
Habt ihr doch die Sterbeurkunde schon vom Amt geholt

Anstatt jemand' zu bezahl'n, um sie vom Schlauchboot zu treten

378,December,"[Verse 1]
Stumbled 'round the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I'm giving up
A heartbreak in mid-December
You don't give a fuck
You never remember me
While you're pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I'll see Chicago
Or a sunset on the West Coast
Or will I die in the cold?
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you'll ever hear this song on your stereo

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

[Verse 2]
Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I'm sure you'll take his hand
I hope he's better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I couldn't say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it's killing me

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December

[Bridge]
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned
I miss your face, you're in my head
There's so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned

[Chorus]
I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I'm the last thing you'd remember
It's been a long, lonely December
I wish I'd known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That's the last thing I remember
It's been a long, lonely December",Neck Deep,1996,"[50, 43, 44, 48, 49]",5
379,Do You Sleep?,"[Verse 1]
I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus]
What have I become now?
Lookin' through your phone now
Oh now, love to you is just a game
Look what I have done now
Dialling up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me, how do you—)
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me, how do you—)

[Verse 2]
Oh, no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what I have done (Done)
Diallin' up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight

[Post-Chorus]
(Tell me how do you—)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you—)
Oh, love will keep you up tonight

[Chorus]
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hopin' that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (Oh)

380,Hurricane,"[Intro: The Game]
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid

381,A Mover La Colita,"[Letra de ""A mover la colita""]

[Intro]
Y ahora vamos todos a mover la colita

[Coro]
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita

[Verso 1]
La mueve el tiburón y la mueve la ballena
La mueve el cocodrilo y Tarzán allá en la selva
También la mueve mi perro para que le tire un hueso
Y la mueve el Pato Donald cuando se mira al espejo
Hay que mover la colita al ritmo de esta canción
Pa' que se vayan las penas y se alegre el corazón

[Coro]
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita

Al ritmo de la cumbia y moviendo la colita

[Verso 2]
Y la mueve la sirena y el caballito del mar
Y la Mujer Maravilla al bailar con Superman
Pa' que se vayan las penas y se alegre el corazón
Vamos todos a moverla al compás de esta canción

[Coro]
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita

[Puente]
¿Y uste' qué espera para moverla?
¿No ve que el ritmo es general?
Mover la colita está de moda
Mover la colita es popular
Izquierda, derecha
Izquierda, derecha, síguele

[Coro]
A ver, a ver, a mover la colita
Si no la mueve se le va a poner malita

382,Can't Be Really Gone,"[Verse 1]
Her hat is hanging by the door
The one she bought in Mexico
It blocked the wind, it stopped the rain
She'd never leave that one
So, she can't be really gone

[Verse 2]
The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve
She laughed and said they called her name
It's like they're waitin' in the hall
For her to slip them on
So, she can't be really gone

[Chorus]
I don't know when she'll come back
She must intend to come back
And I've seen the error of my ways
Don't waste the tears on me
What more proof do you need
Just look around the room, so much of her remains

[Verse 3]
Her book is lying on the bed
The 'two of hearts' to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
At chapter 21
So, she can't be really gone

[Bridge]
Just look around this room
So much of her remains

[Outro]
Her book is lying on the bed
The 'two of hearts' to mark her page
Now who could ever walk away
With so much left undone
So, she can't be really gone
No, she can't be really gone",Tim McGraw,1996,"[99, 97, 96, 87, 94]",5
383,East Side Rendezvous,"[Verse 1: Frost]
I just woke up, thank God it's Friday
Fire up the lac and hit the highway
Pulled in the car wash, so we can hit them whitewall tires
Sedan DeVille sitting on L.A. Wires
And it's got to be 80 degrees
I got a check in my pocket for fifteen G's
Hit the first interstate, now I'm straight
Stop at the record store to pick me up an old school tape
Back in my ride, see the spin of the tires
Kid Frost rolling, bumping Earth, Wind, & Fire
It feels good holding fifteen grand
So I parked the Sedan and I strolled into Greenspans
Give me a pair of your 50-30s
Cascades, Cortez and a jet-black hoodie
Headed back home and got G'd-up, fool
It's an eastside rendezvous, yeah yeah

[Hook: Diane Gordon]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 2: O.G. Enius]
Now, who be that brand new daddy of the year
I swear; baby, we gonna take you there
It's me, that eastside G y'all never heard of
With A.L.T. and them folks getting much love
Through the neighborhoods, through the city
Woofers in the back bumping 'do-wah-ditty', yeah
Drop a line to them hookers for their info
Pack them smokes, LA capping with their khacks low
Cause we some true players, bandits
Got them hynas at the hotel and they can't stand it
I got that sexual healing on them
36-double-deuce-36 and I'm feeling on them
Ooh-eee, I see, she got it going on like a true Miss G
But I'm a stay true P-I-M-P from the eastside

[Hook]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

[Verse 3: A.L.T.]
Now it's Friday night and everything's alright
So just sit back, relax and enjoy the flight
It's A.L.T. hitting corners in the 63
And I'm straight rendezvous-in' through the SGV
As the 18's blast, pop the tape in the dash
Bumping old school fools like Teddy Pendergrass
I can feel the heat coming out from underneath my seat
I never heard the word 'defeat'
It's the middle of July, so it's hot
I think of Kid Frost, he's recording at the G Spot, fool
Frost said, ""I hope the one time don't stop ya""
I don't give a damn, I'm sipping Malibu and Vodka
I'm on that San Bernardino
In the fast lane cause baby got some hynas out in Chino
And you know that I'm a G'd up fool
It's an eastside rendezvous and I'm there

[Hook]
Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me on that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me like them gangstas do

384,Waterfalls,"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby it's good to me""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
(Your way or no way)
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear  blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
View from a balcony, pool lit up blue
Lawn chairs next to the ice chest
Stuffed two grams in the blunt that we just blew
Now I'm getting blown by a bitch
Who? I don't know her name
Gold chain hanging, got a few in the room
But I don't wear them out, only wear them in the house
'Cause I shine so bright, I don't wanna blind you
Who knew Yung $now wouldn't melt in the summer? It's true
Cold as a polar bear
Chilling with Stunna and $lick, I'm surrounded by tulips
Got me 'bout two clips
Got me 'bout two scripts filled up with Oxy
Smoke hovers all around my fucking body
I murdered this bitch named Oddy, yeah, I shot him
$lick got the shovels, and we digging all night
Pouya in the Caddy
Told him, ""shine the light bright"" 'cause I'm digging in darkness
What was a good day has turned into the usual
Back in all black like a funeral

When you come home, I'll stop this

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
Runnin' from the cops through the motherfucking 7th
Six bodies dropped, and nobody went to heaven
Block stay hot when I'm creeping with the weapon
Gotta keep the pills in me all because of my depression
City of the crescent, riding with a Smith and Wesson
Got a motherfucker guessing when I hit 'em with the blessing
Two shots to the dome, six shots in the chrome
All shot through your home, now that’s a crime zone
$-U-I-C-I-D-E, $carecrow creepin' with Uzi
Lucifer, please come save me, throw crucifixes at my feet
Walking through the depths of hell, watchin' as the oceans swell

When you come home, I'll stop this

Yuh, she too deep in the flask
Drinking and thinking gonna lead to a bad decision
Déjà vu, I've been through it with you
Multiple times on many occasions
Contemplating vacating without you, I doubt you the one
I could be wrong; I could be sprung; I could be dumb
I could be dumbfounded, well-rounded
Plus the head game therapeutic
She knew that she blew it like Nintendo, you heard me
Some of y'all better curve me, my dick game army strong
My only hope is my song go on for long
This life ain't promised whether you accomplished
What you think about inside of yo apartment
You working for nothing you worthless, bitch

390,Sometimes I Miss You So Much (Dedicated To The Christ Consciousness),"There are only whispers and shadows for me
The way things are and the way things are
And with this I blow a kiss to disaster
Because I wish to perfect my heart...
I gotta check my mind...
Am I in tune with you?
Do we connect within the realm of the gods?
Electric word ""life"" that means forever
And thats a mighty long time when you've kissed divine
So divine...as with you
The Christ within will come in the clouds
Trusting ""divinity is always with me""
Trusting ""this is the here and now""
Mercy's right...I gotta check my love
And I'm trying to do as such
I don't let the demons get me down
It's just that sometimes I miss you so much...

I can envision all things to life
I can understand realistic ways
But I invent the next phase in forever
I like you, rewrite the next page
It's so pristine...it's so untouched
I'm an emmaculate sign of devotion
Still unseen...I'm thinking so what
Bless me cursed with colorful emotions
God said ""I guess you don't know I'm you
Because you know the entire 360""
A Christ that's me
A Christ that's you
Reguardless...constantly within me
I'm so not responsible for this
I'm just a man in love with so much
I know love...you'll always be with me

You ain't pay the toll, quit smacking troll
Cross that bridge you catching brooklyn kid
Move left, hear harlem, get shook
Call your next kin
Running your mouth, lacking bearing and discipline
These tards not up to par to spar underguard
I just farted it smells like his underarms
Got his hands up, like he's in class
Kissing the teachers ass
Straight A's, teachers pet
Put that apple on the teachers desk
This right here, just a test of them
Ignorant on them, I meant new Testament
Words of wisdom, visions heaven sent
It's evident, your not innocent
Just hellbent, instead
We poppin off on them, over internet
That's a bet, caught interest
Shit you spit, we not impressed
Fresh to death, blessed to see the days i'm lent
Leap frog over you wannabe MC's and hip hoppers
Shits bonkers, all of you
Just ass kissing cock bobbers
Learn to speak proper, come off your high horse
Your not a monster
Imitating adopted ass is foster
No king, there's only the don, kiss the ring
180, i'm captain kirk
Your just a ka-ka-ka-ka- klingon
Sending you deep space, no trace, be gone
Bitches screaming yo R3kLuSE, where the fuck you from?
What it matter? how about where im at
Outside waiting, with a loaded gat
Meant tic tac, toe
This shit for fun, laugh at you scum
Cruel and hazardous
All your raps sound blasphemous
Your trashin us is wack, stay back
Your done
I'm a visionary, give you spit like pictionary
Not gonna dumb it down, get a dictionary
Couldn't make it clearer with some windex
Streak free clean, your bars so obsolete
Bitches say freeze, I hit control, alt, delete
Get you stupid, the riddler's toy, mind depletes
Arnold schwarzenegger, so cold
Batman, he's the king of gotham
Fucking governor of auto tuned mc's
Get you a twelve step, quit smoking bad tree's
Get a snow ski, try gliding
Quit hiding, behind the scenes
Fake ass rappers attempting to connect the dots
Think its hot
It dropped
Its not
The feds is listening, the bitches is whistling
Your bitch got my dick deepthroat
About to blow up, like watergate
[as the bed shakes]
Crooked as nixon
See me leaning on that impeachment
Resign to find, dirty ignorance is bliss
Fulfill my duties as a man
Strong offense unstoppable defense
Repent your sins, as confessions descend
Listen to them, fuel up on dividends
Multiply empty times
Get only dark skies
Steady cons and lies, motivation drives
Too late only God designs
He uncovers the despise, the reprise and wolf cries
Equals bitter demise
It's haters and perpetrators
Brain washing poor victims with tv
Oscar nominating acting
You left contracting
Hells evil disease, the weak believed
And strong were deceived
Reasons need a reminder, we on the same team
You ain't running shit
But an irregular bowel movement
Diarrhea when you see us
Laxatives running through them
Clean the hater's out like drano
You clogged up? you choke everyday though
Post it note, new reminder
Add R3kLuSE, you get the spider
Eat you up everyday cause i'm a surviver
Get in this mess, you gonna get the address
Like the president at the podium
I'm spitting, you listening
Catching arachnophobia

[Verse 2]
I'm more than just a number
I'm a hater, I'm a lover
Sometimes it's hard for me to show
That I'm more than just a title
Or a comment going viral
There's more to me than people know

[Pre-Chorus]
Some days I'm broke, some days I'm rich
Some days I'm nice, some days I can be a bitch
Some days I'm strong, some days I quit
I don't let it show, but I've been through some shit

[Chorus]
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl, I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl
I can swear, I can joke
I say what's on my mind
If I drink, if I smoke
I keep up with the guys
And you see me holding up my middle finger to the world
Fuck your ribbons and your pearls
'Cause I'm not just a pretty girl, I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl, no I'm not just a pretty girl
I'm not just a pretty girl",Maggie Lindemann,1996,"[60, 57]",2
396,Cold World,"[Intro: sample]
“I had a bad dream”
“Don’t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams”
“What a time you chose to be born in”

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year’s
And all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight
Fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made ‘em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmers
And it’s bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don’t suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae
Increase the murder rate
Similar to hitmen who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo; no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o’clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
Three-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours
Bought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
‘Cause niggas’ main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet-black Galant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
‘Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I’m not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

[Bridge: Life]
You know, you had me
With your sensuous charm
But you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by

[Chorus: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world",GZA,1996,"[100, 100]",2
397,"I Like It, I Love It","[Verse 1]
Spent forty-eight dollars last night at the county fair
I threw out my shoulder but I won her that teddy bear
She's got me sayin' sugar-pie, honey, darlin', and dear
I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
My long lost buddies say I'm gettin' in too deep

[Chorus]
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Verse 2]
My Mama and Daddy tried to teach me courtesy
But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
Now I'm holdin' umbrellas and openin' up doors
I'm takin' out the trash and I'm sweepin' my floors
I'm crossin' my fingers and countin' every kiss
Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this

[Chorus]
'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Bridge]
Gotta wash my truck and dress up
To pick her up to watch TV
And she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
She can't get enough of me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
I try so hard, I can't rise above it
Don't know what it is 'bout that little gal's lovin'
But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it

[Outro]
Come on, baby
You know what I like
Yeah, I like that
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights",Tim McGraw,1996,[55],1

So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 duckets
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid
Playa, playa, holla, holla, St. Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of yayo and a quarter O, oh
Most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut so fuck them po-po
Toss all that yayo then roll with a pound and stay low

Gotta grind, gotta get mine
In the hood that I claim and I slang on that double 9-9
Gotta find them dubs
Gonna get a 40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner: St. Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap pap
From the 1st to the 15th
Niggas smoke plenty weed but I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad, count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back, see for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block

But it's the 1st, so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know, did your O.G. check come?
Sure, put me down!

And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of the skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the 1st come around
Now I be freakin' me Black n Mild
Headed cross town cause niggas, the 1st get celebrated
Rushin' to the block cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs
Poetic Hustlaz and the Graveyard Shift, on the 1st
